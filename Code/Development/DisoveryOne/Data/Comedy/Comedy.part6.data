     EXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY

     Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars
     motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls
     of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms.

     ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk,
     past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops,
     Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of
     this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE-
     HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to look
     at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see
     they're leaving a 99-cent store.

     As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are
     connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS.
     Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going.

     They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The men
     pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful
     woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes
     rest on her a microsecond longer than usual.

     - Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the
     tops of her thighs.

     - A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a
     MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR.

     - A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the
     TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER.

     It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block
     that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is
     so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All
     those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have
     obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH.

     EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

     A side street.  No pedestrians, just parked cars.  A PARKING
     TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai.

                               ERIN
            Fuck.

     Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to
     her voice.  Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze.

     As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses
     accidentally CLATTER to the ground.

                               ERIN
            Shit.

     When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement.

                               ERIN
            God damn it.

     She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.

     WIDER ON THE STREET

     The Hyundai starts it up, signals.  Then, just as it pulls
     slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the
     corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side
     of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.  It
     SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.  And stops.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY

     A boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded
     by strip malls.  Definitely not where the power lawyers work.

                               ROSALIND (O.S.)
            Morning, Mr. Masry.  How you doing today?

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY

     Generic.  Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art.  A sign over
     the reception desk reads: MASRY & VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW.

     ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper
     receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand.  He's in his
     mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM --
     already rumpled.

                               ED
            Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind.

     Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that
     is his career has long since dissipated.  He trundles off
     toward his office.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ed's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what
     can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner.
     She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed.

                               BRENDA
            Tony Marvin.

                               ED
            Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain
            and suffering this time?

                               BRENDA
            His dry cleaners.  You want him?

                               ED
            What do you think?  What's this?

     He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card.

                               BRENDA
            Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.

                               ED
            Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.

                               BRENDA
            He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's
            your nine o'clock in there.

     Ed peers into his office.  It's a mess -- papers everywhere,
     unopened mail.  Standing in the middle of the room is Erin,
     in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress.  As she jiggles a
     spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously.
     Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace.

                               ED
            Whoa.
                        (to Brenda)
            Remind me.

                               BRENDA
            Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her
            fault, she says.
                        (sarcastic)
            And she looks like such an honest girl, don't
            you think?

                               ED
            You shouldn't judge, Brenda.

                               BRENDA
            Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.

     As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone.

                               BRENDA
            I can't find him, Tony.  We'll have to call
            you back.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Not an office that exudes authority, and Ed's blustery
     entrance only adds to the sense of chaos.

                               ED
            Erin -- hi.  Sorry you had to wait.  Here,
            sit down, sit down.

     He clears a stack of papers off a chair.

                               ERIN
            Thanks a lot.
                        (as she sits)
            I tell you, I never thought just standing
            would take it out of me, but ever since that
            shithead hit me, it feels like my whole
            body's put together wrong.

     Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy.

                               ED
            Jesus, you poor thing.
                        (he sits)
            Well, listen, you came to the right place.
            Whoever did this to you made one hell of a
            mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make
            him pay for it.

     He takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write.

                               ED
            Why don't you tell me what happened?

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAY

     Erin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she
     owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to
     Ed, who's questioning her.

                               ERIN
            I was pulling out real slow, and out of
            nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the
            corner like a bat outta hell ...

     She glances at the defendant's table, where a DOCTOR sits
     nobly in surgical scrubs.  His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS
     are behind him.  A frigging Norman Rockwell painting.

     LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:

                               ERIN
            They took some bone from my hip and put it
            in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm
            about seventeen thousand in debt right now.

     STILL LATER:

                               ERIN
            ... couldn't take painkillers cause they
            made me too groggy to take care of my kids.

     STILL LATER:

                               ERIN
            ... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's
            just nine months.

     STILL LATER:

                               ERIN
            ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person,
            a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care
            of my kids.  You know?

                               ED
                        (oh so moved)
            Yeah.  I know.

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     Erin is still on the stand.  But now the doctor's lawyer is
     questioning her.

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
            Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your
            ex-husband helping out?

                               ERIN
            Which one?

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
                        (feigning shock)
            There's more than one?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  There's two.  Why?

     Erin looks over at the jury.  The personification of
     conservative family values.  Oh, shit.

     LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:

                               ERIN
                        (getting defensive)
            ... not like a career, cause I had my babies.
            But I woulda worked, for sure, if I didn't
            have this neck thing.

     Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem.
     Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch.

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
                        (sarcastic)
            Right.  No doubt.

     Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances.  Great.

     STILL LATER:

     The defendant's lawyers is on the offensive.  Erin's starting
     to feel the case slipping away.

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
            So.  You must've been feeling pretty
            desperate that afternoon.

                               ERIN
                        (pointed)
            What's your point?

     Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad.

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
            Broke, three kids, no job.  A doctor in a
            Jaguar must've looked like a pretty good
            meal ticket.

     Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement.
     She's on a sinking ship.

                               ERIN
            What?  Hey -- he hit me.

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
            So you say.

                               ERIN
            He came tearing around the corner, out of
            control --

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
            An ER doctor who spends his days saving
            lives was the one out of control --

                               ERIN
                        (erupting)
            That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!

     INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

     The door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out,
     furious.  Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator.

                               ERIN
            Open and shut?  Open and fucking shut?

                               ED
            If you hadn't used profanity --

                               ERIN
            Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God
            damn, he made me look like some cheap --

                               ED
            I told you the questions might get a little
            personal --

                               ERIN
            Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a
            million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.

     Ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention.

                               ED
            Okay -- let's try and settle down here.

                               ERIN
            Settle down?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr.
            Masry!  I can't afford to settle down!

     Beat.

                               ED
            I'm sorry, Erin.

                               ERIN
            Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my
            kids.

     Erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

     A shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge.  The
     Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb.

     Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads
     over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell.

     A Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white
     baby.  This is MRS. MORALES.

                               MRS. MORALES
            Hi, Erin!  You're back so soon.  How was it?

     She hands Erin the baby.  It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old.
     Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.

                               ERIN
            Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where
            are Matt and Katie?

                               MRS. MORALES
            Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?

     The truth is too depressing to share.

                               ERIN
            It'll be fine, yeah.

                               MRS. MORALES
            Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell
            you before, with your worries --

                               ERIN
            What?

                               MRS. MORALES
            My daughter, she's bought a big house with a
            room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.

                               ERIN
            You're moving away?  When?

                               MRS. MORALES
            Next week.

                               ERIN
                        (stunned)
            Wow, that's soon --

                               MRS. MORALES
            I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can
            help my daughter take care of my grandkids.
            And it's good for you, too.  Now you have
            money, you can find a good babysitter, huh?
            Not the old lady next door.

     Oh, God.  In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

     Erin carries Beth up to her house.  As she nears her door,
     she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG.  It crunches under her sole.

                               ERIN
            Ugh.

     Insult added to injury.  She heads up to the house, dragging
     her shoe, wiping off the bug guts.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN LIVING/DINING SPACE - DAY

     Just as dull inside.  Salvation Army furniture.  A lot of
     beige.  Erin's two older kids, MATTHEW (7) and KATIE (5) are
     at the table.  Beth is in a baby seat.  Erin spoons some Mac
     & Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry.

                               MATTHEW
            I don't like this part, it's all crusty.

                               KATIE
            I like the crust.

     Erin switches the plates.

                               ERIN
            Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.

                               KATIE
            How come you're not eating?

     Cause there isn't enough food.

                               ERIN
            Mamma's gonna eat later.

     From her baby seat on the table, Beth COUGHS some more.
     Thick, sick-sounding coughs.  Erin looks at her.

                               ERIN
            Don't go getting sick on me, baby.  Okay?

     INT. ERIN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     The shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with
     STEAM.  Erin is seated with COUGHING, CRYING Beth on her lap,
     trying to steam the illness out of her.

                               ERIN
            It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.  I promise.

     But her face doesn't look like she believes it.

     EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

     Matt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine.

     INT. DRUGSTORE, AISLE - DAY

     Erin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles.  She stops at the
     medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself,
     glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle.

     INT. DRUGSTORE, AT THE REGISTER - DAY

     As a CUSTOMER steps away from the register, Erin steps up
     with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the CHECK-OUT LADY.

                               ERIN
            Hi, remember me?  I was in yesterday.  Bought
            a whole mess of stuff?  Round about five?

                               CHECK-OUT LADY
            Honey, it's a zoo here at five.  I'm lucky
            if I even see a face, much less remember it.

                               ERIN
            Oh, shoot, yeah, I guess that'd be tough.
            Well, listen, I meant to buy my baby here
            some medicine, and by the time I got home, I
            realized I'd bought the adult stuff by
            mistake.  And now, wouldn't you know, I
            can't find the receipt.  I was wondering --
            could I maybe exchange it anyway ...

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

     Erin feeds Beth her medicine, feeling miserable about it.

                               ERIN
            Just remember.  No matter what your Mamma
            does, lying and stealing is real bad.  I
            don't ever wanna hear you doing something
            like that ...

     On the table beside her sit the classifieds.  Row after row
     of want ads circled, then X-'d out in red.  A WATER BUG
     crawls across the edge of the paper.

                               ERIN
            ... Cause there's no excuse for it, you hear
            me?  No excuse at all.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Midday.  Ed enters with a cup of coffee in his hand.  As he
     heads to his desk, he trips on a box of files.  Coffee
     sloshes out of his cup, onto his shirt.

                               ED
            Damn it!
                        (calling out)
            Brenda!

     She pops her head in.

                               BRENDA
            Yeah?

     He grabs a tissue, swabs his shirt, then kicks at the box.

                               ED
            What the hell is this doing here?

                               BRENDA
            It's those files you asked for.

                               ED
            I didn't mean for you to leave them in the
            middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me.
            What do I have this afternoon?

                               BRENDA
            Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.

     As Ed checks his reflection in the glass wall of his office,
     he notices, on the other side:

     ERIN, standing in the middle of the secretaries' area, in a
     miniskirt and leather bustier, talking to MARIO, the firm's
     mentally challenged office boy.  Mario heads away from her.

                               ED
            What's she doing here?

                               BRENDA
            Who?

     Ed goes to his office door and waves Mario over.

                               ED
            Hey -- Mario -- what's she doing here?

                               MARIO
            She works here.

     Ed looks back at her -- what the hell?

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     The support staff -- mostly middle-aged women -- are all
     stealing glances at Erin.  Ed comes up to her, all friendly.

                               ED
            Erin!  How's it going?

     Up close, the wear and tear of worry show on her face.

                               ERIN
            You never called me back.  I left messages.

                               ED
            You did?  Wow, sorry about that.
                        (beat)
            Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He
            seems to think that you said --

                               ERIN
            There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry.
            Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did
            both.

     Glances skitter between the secretaries -- get a load of
     this.  Ed lowers his voice.

                               ED
            I never lied.  I may have miscalculated --
            that happens sometimes, but --

                               ERIN
            You said things would be fine, and they're
            not.

                               ED
            I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --

                               ERIN
            I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And
            I've looked, but when you've spent the last
            six years raising babies, it's real hard to
            convince someone to give you a job that pays
            worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the
            one who said I was gonna be okay, you should
            be the one to hire me.

     Ed sees everyone watching him, listening.

                               ED
            I'd love to help, Erin, but I'm sorry, I
            have a full staff right now, so --

     He starts to escort her out, but she stays put.

                               ERIN
            Bullshit.  If you had a full staff, you'd
            have time to return your damn phone calls.

     She's backing him into a corner here.  He shifts gears.

                               ED
            Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for
            a job here, you can do it the way everyone
            else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --

                               ERIN
            I'm not everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm
            someone you made promises to that you didn't
            deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids'
            well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard-
            working, and I'll do anything.  But if you
            think I'm leaving here without a job, you
            got another thing coming.

     Ed glances around the room.  Not a whole lot of options here.
     He looks back at Erin.

                               ED
            No benefits.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY

     A tight office lined with file cabinets and shelves.  ANNA,
     the humorless file clerk, is showing Erin around.

                               ANNA
            ... what we do in here is keep track of all
            the case files.  That way, at any time, we
            can find out a case's status -- where it is
            in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em
            all here, alphabetically --

                               ERIN
            Oh, hell.
                        (beat)
            I'm dyslexic.

                               ANNA
            That's a joke, right?

     Erin shakes her head, no.  Great, thinks Anna.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     As Anna shows Erin around the office, they pass JANE, the
     bitter office manager, and Brenda, at the coffee area.

                               JANE
            Just last week, he told my sister we weren't
            hiring.

                               BRENDA
            What's your sister look like?

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Ed is packing up his office.  Erin sticks her head in.

                               ERIN
            Mr. Masry?

     He turns, sees her.

                               ED
            Yeah?

                               ERIN
            I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd
            talk to about maybe getting an advance on my
            paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.

                               ED
            Jane's the office manager.  She handles
            payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early
            on Fridays.

                               ERIN
            Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.

     Ed looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay.

                               ED
            Oh, for Christ's sake ...

     He takes out his wallet, looks in.

                               ED
            All I have is hundreds.

                               ERIN
            I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.

                               ED
            Bullshit, you don't.

     He slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves.  When he's gone,
     she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a
     great big kiss.

     EXT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a
     shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's.  Katie and Matt
     pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house.

     EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

     Erin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag
     of groceries in the other.  Katie and Matt are each carrying
     a bag of groceries as well.  They are all singing and moving
     with the jaunty step of the newly carefree.  Katie spots a
     flower display outside the store.

                               KATIE
            Mommy, can I get a flower?

                               ERIN
            Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     A small room with Salvation Army furniture.  A BUNCH OF
     DAISIES is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table.
     Matt and Katie are asleep in bed.  Erin looks down at them,
     smiles, then kisses them good-night.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Erin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door.
     But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled
     with the DEAFENING ROAR of a MOTORCYCLE, REVVING and REVVING.
     It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what
     used to be Mrs. Morales's house.  A few MOTORCYCLES are
     parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the
     stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE.

                               ERIN
            Hey!

     But of course he can't hear her.  She walks over to him,
     stands right in his line of vision.

                               ERIN
            HEY!

     He sees her and kills the engine.  Everything about GEORGE
     HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long
     hair.  Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's.

                               GEORGE
            Well, hello to you, darlin'.

                               ERIN
            What the hell do you think you're doing,
            making all that Goddamn noise?

                               GEORGE
            Just introducing myself to the neighbors.

                               ERIN
            Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're
            introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.

     The guys on the porch chuckle.  Erin turns and starts back to
     her house.  George hops off his bike and follows her.

                               GEORGE
            Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a
            beautiful woman next door, I'da done this
            different.  Let's start over.  My name's
            George.  What's yours?

                               ERIN
            Just think of me as the person next door who
            likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.

                               GEORGE
            Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what.
            How about if I take you out on a date to
            apologize for my rudeness?

     Erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking.

                               GEORGE
            Come on.  Gimme your number, I'll call you
            up proper and ask you out and everything.

     She stops at her porch, turns to him.

                               ERIN
            You want my number?

                               GEORGE
            I do.

                               ERIN
            Which number do you want, George?

                               GEORGE
            You got more than one?

                               ERIN
            Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of
            my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.

                               GEORGE
            Ten?

                               ERIN
            Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how
            many months old my little girl is.

                               GEORGE
            You got a little girl?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five.
            That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven
            is my son's age.  Two is how many times I
            been married and divorced.  You getting all
            this?  16 is the number of dollars in my
            bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number.
            And with all the other numbers I gave you,
            I'm guessing zero is the number of times
            you're gonna call it.

     She turns and heads inside.  He calls out after her:

                               GEORGE
            How the hell do you know your bank balance
            right off the top of your head like that?
            See, that impresses me.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

     Morning.  Erin walks in, wearing her usual garb.  She passes
     the coffee area, where Jane, Brenda, and Anna are milling.
     Brenda sees her, gives Anna a nudge.  They both check out her
     short hem.  Anna nudges Jane, who looks as well.  Erin
     glances over just in time to see all three of them staring at
     her judgementally.  She stops in her tracks and stares back.

                               ERIN
            Y'all got something you wanna discuss?

     The women go back to stirring their coffees.  Erin walks on.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ed is walking into his office with a coffee cup in his hand
     when he trips over the same box of files again.

                               ED
            Damn it!
                        (calling out)
            Brenda!
                        (no answer)
            BRENDA!

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY

     Erin is alone, filing as she talks on the phone.

                               ERIN
            How long's she been crying like that? ...
            Well, she's got that tooth coming in --

     Ed appears in the door, carrying the box of files.

                               ERIN
            Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --
                        (sees Ed)
            I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that
            bag -- I'll check back in a bit.
                        (hangs up)
            Sorry.  My kid --

                               ED
            Where's Anna?

                               ERIN
            Out to lunch with the girls.

                               ED
            Oh.  Huh.
                        (beat)
            Well, look, I got this file I need valued.
            Real estate thing.  A lady has some property
            next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy.
            I need to know what to ask for it.

     He plunks the box of files on her desk.  She stares at it,
     with no idea of how to go about that.

                               ERIN
            Oh.  Okay.

     He sees her staring at the box.

                               ED
            You do know how to do that, don't you?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.

                               ED
            Good.

     Ed heads out, but pauses before leaving.

                               ED
            You're a girl.

                               ERIN
            Excuse me?

                               ED
            How come you're not at lunch with the girls?
            You're a girl.

                               ERIN
            I guess I'm not the right kind.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - NIGHT

     Erin is at her desk, staring bewildered at the files from the
     box Ed gave her, which are now spread across her desktop.
     She sees Anna packing up her things, to leave.

                               ERIN
            Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff -
            - could you remind me, cause I'm a little
            confused about how exactly we do that.

                               ANNA
                        (exasperated)
            Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you
            don't know how to do your job by now, I am
            not about to do it for you.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Katie and Matt are running up to the house.  Erin follows,
     toting Beth under one arm and the box of documents under the
     other.  She steps on another water bug.

                               ERIN
            Ugh.

     As she wipes the bug guts off the bottom of her shoe:

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            Hey, neighbor, wanna beer?

     She spots George on his stoop, with a six-pack beside him.

                               ERIN
            No.

                               GEORGE
            C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for
            that night.

                               ERIN
            Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money
            back.

     He gets up and follows her to her house.

                               GEORGE
            Now, why're you giving me such a hard time?
            I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.

     Erin turns to him.  The kids are waiting at the door.

                               ERIN
            I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60
            and Mexican and she watched my kids for
            free.  Something tells me you're not gonna
            be able to measure up to that.

                               GEORGE
            You need help with your kids?  I could
            probably do that.

     George reaches out and grabs the box from under her arm.

                               ERIN
            I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.

                               GEORGE
            Why not?

                               ERIN
            Cause I don't even know you.

                               GEORGE
            Yeah, and whose fault is that?

     He's got a point there.  After a beat:

                               GEORGE
            What, you got so many friends in this world,
            you don't have use for one more?

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     George is on the floor with Matt and Katie, playing War.
     Katie points to the Harley emblem on his leather jacket.

                               KATIE
            What's that stand for?

                               GEORGE
            That's for Harley Davidson.  The best damn
            motorcycle ever made.

     Erin comes in from the kitchen.

                               ERIN
            And if I catch either of you anywhere near
            one, I'll knock you silly.  Go on to bed,
            now -- I'll come tuck you in in a minute.

     They get up ...

                               GEORGE
            Night.

                               KATIE/MATT
            Night.

     ... and head into bed.  George starts cleaning up the cards.

                               GEORGE
            Great kids.

     Erin bends down to help him.

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.

                               GEORGE
            How?

                               ERIN
            I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this
            weird sitter all afternoon who costs a
            fortune and smells like chicken fat.

                               GEORGE
            I was serious before, you know.  If you need
            someone to keep an eye on them -- after
            school or something -- I don't have a job
            now, so I'm around in the afternoons.

                               ERIN
            Great.  Another deadbeat.

                               GEORGE
            I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.

                               ERIN
            Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the
            time, live off your trust fund?

                               GEORGE
            I do construction, which pays real good.
            And I make it last by living cheap.

                               ERIN
                        (with a little laugh)
            I hope that's not supposed to impress me.

                               GEORGE
            Are you this hard on everyone who tries to
            help you?

                               ERIN
            It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of
            practice.

                               GEORGE
            Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is
            to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer,
            I don't mind taking you up on it.

                               ERIN
            Why in the hell would you want to watch my
            kids?

                               GEORGE
            Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with
            them.

                               ERIN
            Right.

     She starts cleaning up the cards.

                               GEORGE
            I do.  I like how they keep it all simple,
            you know?  They don't get all complicated
            about life, like grown-ups do.  A bicycle
            and an ice cream cone -- boom, done, they're
            happy.

     Erin thinks about the offer.

                               ERIN
            You're around every afternoon?

                               GEORGE
            Yup.  Usually working on my bike.
                        (she's tempted)
            No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you
            can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.

     Tempting.  Erin looks him over.

                               ERIN
            This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.

                               GEORGE
                        (with a laugh)
            Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The wee hours.  Erin's in a t-shirt, sitting on her mattress
     on the floor.  The paperwork from the box is now spread all
     over the floor around her.  She's reading a letter.

     CLOSE ON THE LETTER

     It's from PG&E, to Donna and Peter Irving.  We see the
     phrases, "purchase your house ...", "fair market value ..."

     CLOSE ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT

     It's a list of comparable house sales in the area.  Owner,
     cost; owner, cost.  Every house is in the $65,000 range.

     From another room, she hears the sound of BETH CRYING.  Still
     reading the file, Erin gets up and goes into:

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Still reading, Erin gets Beth out of her crib.  Beth quiets.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Erin lies down on the mattress and rests Beth on her chest.
     She sets down the file she was reading and picks up another.

     CLOSE ON THE FILE

     It contains a letter from a Dr. Howard Reeves.  The first
     paragraph contains the phrase "... medical examination of
     Donna and Peter Irving ..."

     Toward the end of the letter, there are two columns.  One is
     headed: "IN RANGE".  The other: "OUT OF RANGE".  Under that
     head appear the following: "lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes,
     natural killer cells, T Helpers, T8 suppresser cells".

     Erin stares at it, confused.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY

     Erin is talking to Jane, who's pouring herself coffee.

                               ERIN
            It was in this real estate file I'm valuing.
            And -- see, I know they're the medical
            records from the people selling the house --
            but it talks about things like lymphocytes
            and T8 suppressers.

     Erin sees Ed pass behind Jane.  She lowers her voice, so he
     won't see her asking for help.

                               ERIN
            I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but
            -- I'm just a little unclear on what those
            things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.

                               JANE
            What do I look like, Erin?  A library?

     And Jane walks away with her coffee.

     EXT. UCLA MAIN LIBRARY - DAY

     Large.  Looming.  Very establishment.  Through the windows,
     we see Erin at the desk, talking to a LIBRARIAN.  She has the
     file in her hands.  Over this:

                               ROSALIND (O.S.)
            Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich.
            From the file room?  I was wondering if you
            could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up
            on that real estate thing out of the office.

     The librarian gives her directions to somewhere else.

     EXT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY

     Smaller, but still establishment.  Erin's Hyundai pulls into
     the parking lot.

     INT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY

     Erin is at the reference desk, eating a candy bar while she
     talks to the LIBRARIAN.  He checks something on the computer.
     A couple of WHITE-COATED MEDICAL STUDENTS pass her, double-
     taking.  They don't see many like her around here.

     INT. UCLA SCIENCE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

     A long, academic hallway lit by fluorescents.  Erin gets off
     an elevator and heads down the hall.  She finds a door with a
     nameplate that reads "Jim Paulsen, Epidemiology" and KNOCKS.

     The door opens and DR. JIM PAULSEN appears.  He's a classic
     scientist: unruly hair, thick glasses.  Nothing like Erin has
     ever shown up at his door.  He reels at the sight of her.

                               ERIN
            Dr. Paulsen?

                               PAULSEN
            Yes?

                               ERIN
            Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in
            the library there, asking a mess of
            questions about -- I guess they call it
            epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me
            to find you, cause you know all about it.

                               PAULSEN
                        (suspicious)
            Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to
            this?

                               ERIN
            Who's Baxter?

                               PAULSEN
            He did, didn't he?  Baxter!

     BAXTER, another scientist, leans out of a door down the hall.

                               BAXTER
            Yeah?

     Baxter and Erin look at each other.  No recognition, of
     course.  Paulsen is immediately embarrassed.

                               PAULSEN
            Oh.  Oh.

                               ERIN
            No one put me up to anything.  I was just
            hoping I could ask you a couple questions.

                               PAULSEN
                        (mortified)
            Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --

     INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY

     Orderly chaos.  Dr. Paulsen, still recovering, has Erin's
     file in his hands.  Erin is sitting across from him.

                               PAULSEN
            Well, look, there isn't a ton of information
            here, but from what there is, I'd say that
            these two people here -- what are their
            names?  Shanna and Ashley?

                               ERIN
            Right, I guess those are the kids --

                               PAULSEN
            They've both got some immune system problem.
            Can't say what from, whether it's viral or
            genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And
            these guys -- Donna and Peter --

                               ERIN
            Their parents, I'm pretty sure.

                               PAULSEN
            Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say
            they both have some form of cancer.

     Wow.  That's more serious than Erin was expecting.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

     CLOSE ON THE FILE on the kitchen counter.  The Irvings' phone
     number is written on the front.  A PHONE IS RINGING.

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            Whoa, whoa!  Easy, easy, easy --

     WIDEN to see Erin, phone to her ear, grabbing a carton of
     juice from Matt and Katie, who are fighting over it at the
     table.  Just as she takes it from them, the phone picks up.

                               DONNA'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Hi!  You've reached the Irvings.  Leave a
            message and we'll get back to you just as
            soon as we can.  Bye-bye.

     BEEP.  Erin thinks a bit, then hangs up and looks at the
     file.  Scrawled on the cover is the Irvings' address, in
     Hinkley, California.

     EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - DAY

     The beat-up old Hyundai heads east out of L.A.  DISCO MUSIC
     blares from its speakers.

     EXT. HINKLEY, CA - DAY

     This is a dry, desolate part of California.  No downtown, no
     community.  Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with
     small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the
     landscape like occasional tombstones.

     A beat-up old sign on the road reads: "HINKLEY, CA.  POP: "
     but the  corner where the number would be has broken off.

     As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto
     Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley.

     INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAY

     Erin looks around.  The house she's passing has been razed.
     A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property.

     As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she
     drives by the PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray
     structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from
     the road.  Erin passes it without noticing it.

     She stops at an intersection.  The house on the corner has
     been boarded up with plywood.  Erin notices it -- depressing
     -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street.

     EXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAY

     A generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of
     nothing.  There's a pool out back and a chain link fence
     hugging the property.  No landscaping.  Dull, but clean.  A
     few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door.

     The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops.  Erin gets
     out.  As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into
     the dirt.  She rings the bell.  It has a melody chime.

     DONNA IRVING opens the door.  She's 35, petite, with a
     scrappy, high-strung manner.  She's wearing tight jeans, and
     her dark curls are piled on top of her head.

                               ERIN
            Hi.  Donna Irving?

                               DONNA
            Yes?

                               ERIN
            I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?

                               DONNA
                        (a little surprised)
            You're a lawyer?

                               ERIN
            Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for
            them.  You got a minute?

     INT. THE IRVINGS' HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

     The house is furnished with little money, but lots of care.
     Erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows.
     Out back, two GIRLS, ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool.

                               ERIN
            This is a real nice place you got here.

                               DONNA (O.S.)
            Well it oughta be, with all the work I put
            into it.

     She comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea.

                               DONNA
            I added air conditioning, put in the pool,
            made all those pillows by hand ...

                               ERIN
            Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that.
            They make the place feel real homey.

     Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows.

                               DONNA
            Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm
            being such a stickler on this house price
            thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's
            backside, especially after all they've done
            for Hinkley, but I look around here and I
            think, if they want this place, they're
            gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just
            mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay
            me for the trouble of starting over.

                               ERIN
            Right.

                               DONNA
            Cause first you gotta move, then there's
            decorating, and if the windows aren't the
            same size, you know -- you're making all new
            curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I
            have the energy.  You know, I've been sick.
            Me and Peter both have.

                               ERIN
            Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I
            was going through your file here, and I ran
            into these medical records.  They kinda
            surprised me --

     This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self-
     pitying.  But not Donna.  Life's handed her a shitload of
     lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade.

                               DONNA
            I know.  They're more than a bit unusual.
            See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's
            disease.  That's a kind of cancer --

                               ERIN
            Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.

                               DONNA
            Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the
            Lord, but you never know.  And then while
            that's going on, I end up having to have a
            hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps
            removed from my breasts.  All benign so far,
            but still, no matter how positive you stay,
            an operation can still take it out of you.

                               ERIN
            I'll say.  Holy moley.

                               DONNA
            So the whole idea of selling the house --
            don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to
            some better place, but if they aren't gonna
            pay us properly, I just don't see the point.

                               ERIN
            Yeah, I can see that.
                        (beat)
            I guess the only thing that confused me is -
            - not that your medical problems aren't
            important, but -- how come the files about
            them are in with all the real estate stuff?

     Donna tops off their iced teas.

                               DONNA
            Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if
            I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I
            just kept all PG&E correspondence in one
            place.

                               ERIN
            Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you
            were corresponding with PG&E about it in the
            first place.

                               DONNA
            Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.

                               ERIN
            They did?

                               DONNA
            You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole
            family.  And not like with insurance where
            you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed,
            either.  They just took care of it.  Just
            like that.  We never even saw a bill.

                               ERIN
            Wow.  Why would they do that?

                               DONNA
            Cause of the chromium.

                               ERIN
            The what?

                               DONNA
            The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this
            whole thing off.

     INT. IRVING HOUSE, GARAGE - DAY

     CLOSE ON A BOX, with "CHROM INFO" scrawled on it.

                               DONNA (O.S.)
            PG&E came around a few years ago, told us
            they put chromium in our well by mistake.
            And since we shouldn't have to drink it if
            we don't want to, they gave us free spring
            water and offered to buy our house.

     WIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room.

                               ERIN
            What's chromium?

                               DONNA
            It's a chemical they used over at that
            compressor station up the road there.

                               ERIN
            Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have
            been so sick --

                               DONNA
            I thought the same thing, right off the bat.
            That's why we went to see the doctor.  But
            hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do
            with the other.

     She rifles through the box.

                               DONNA
            This is the info they gave us.  You'll see
            if you look through it, chromium's good for
            you.  When I saw what they charged for it at
            the health-food stores, I about fainted.

     She hands Erin a printed fact sheet.  Erin scans it.

                               ERIN
            Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your
            water being messed with and you being so
            sick.

                               DONNA
            Not around here.  This is a rough part of
            the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money,
            not a lot of luck.
                        (beat)
            It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town
            like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.

     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Erin's driving away from Donna's house.  A street lamp throws
     light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat.

     She gets to an intersection and looks across the street at
     the massive COMPRESSOR STATION.  Six stories high, lit up
     like a Christmas tree, with all sizes of PIPES criss-crossing
     the outside and GIANT COOLING TOWERS sticking up out of it.
     Far more massive than anything else in town, it looms over
     the horizon like the Capitol in D.C. or St. Peter's in Rome.

     Erin takes a long look at the compressor station, then turns
     onto Community Boulevard and drives away.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

     Erin is holding Beth, making her a bottle, when she hears
     NOISES coming from outside.  She follows them.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

     Erin opens the door to find George attaching bars to her
     windows.

                               ERIN
            What're you doing?

                               GEORGE
            Better safe than sorry.

     She shakes her head, amused by his persistence.

                               ERIN
            You want some coffee, George?

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

     George follows Erin in.

                               GEORGE
            I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front
            door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest
            neighborhood in the world, you know.

                               ERIN
            Thanks for reminding me.

                               GEORGE
            I guess we get what we pay for, huh?

     Erin pours him some coffee, hands it to him.

                               ERIN
            You think it could make you sick, living in
            a place like this?

                               GEORGE
            What do you mean?

     George settles in, helps himself to sugar.

                               ERIN
            I was talking to this lady -- she and her
            husband both got cancer, and she thinks it's
            cause they live in a bad neighborhood.  You
            think that's possible?  That living in a bad
            neighborhood could give you cancer?

     George laughs a little at the thought.

                               GEORGE
            Man, I hope not.  You got enough damn
            problems.

     But Erin's still mulling it over.

     EXT. NORTHRIDGE, ERIN'S BLOCK - DAY

     Erin clips down the block in short-shorts and high-heeled
     boots.  Up ahead a few of DOWN-ON-THEIR-LUCK MEN are out on a
     stoop, drinking their breakfast.  Erin approaches them.

                               ERIN
            Hi, y'all -- how you doing today?

                               MAN 1
            Hangin' in, baby.  How about yourself?

                               ERIN
            I'm okay, I'm just fine.  I was wondering --
            could I maybe ask you a couple questions?

     She settles down on the stoop with them for a chat.

     INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY

     Dr. Paulsen and Erin are sitting, talking.  He's thrilled to
     have her back in his office.

                               ERIN
            ... and when I realized our area's just as
            bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors
            are all sick too.  So I went and asked.

                               PAULSEN
                        (surprised)
            You did?

     Erin digs a pad of paper out of her bag.

                               ERIN
            Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on
            doors.  And you know what?  They're not.
                        (reads from the pad)
            I mean, they got problems, but none of this
            cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So
            I don't know -- I just can't shake the
            feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they
            put in the water.

                               PAULSEN
            Well, if you're talking about contamination,
            you're getting out of my area of expertise.
            Let me give you the name of a toxicologist
            friend of mine over at USC.

     Paulsen reaches for a notepad, scrawls on it.

     INT. UCLA MEDICAL BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

     Paulsen is seeing Erin out of his office.

                               PAULSEN
            I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I
            did not peg you as the kind to go off and
            conduct her own epidemiological study.

                               ERIN
            Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my
            reputation.

     EXT. USC CAMPUS - DAY

     Erin towers over DAVID FRANKEL as she walks across campus
     with him.  He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia,
     Birkenstocks, bushy beard.  He's as dry as dust, and as much
     as Dr. Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her.

                               FRANKEL
            What kind of chromium is it?

                               ERIN
            There's more than one kind?

                               FRANKEL
            Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does
            all kinds of good things for the body.
            There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and
            then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium,
            which, depending on the amounts, can be very
            harmful.

                               ERIN
            Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?

                               FRANKEL
            With repeated exposure to toxic levels --
            God, anything, really -- respiratory
            disease, liver failure, heart failure,
            reproductive failure, chronic headaches,
            bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of
            course, any type of cancer.

     He rattles it off coolly.  Just facts.  Erin's stunned.

                               ERIN
            So that stuff -- it kills people.

                               FRANKEL
            Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly
            carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.

                               ERIN
            Well, how do I find out what kind of
            chromium is up in Hinkley?

                               FRANKEL
            Have you been to the water board?

                               ERIN
            Hunh-uh.  What's that?

                               FRANKEL
            Every county has one.  They keep records of
            anything water-related within their
            jurisdiction.  You should be able to find
            something there.

                               ERIN
            County water board.  All righty, thanks.

                               FRANKEL
            Good luck.
                        (beat)
            Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're
            looking for if I were you ...

     His line continues over:

     EXT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL WATER BOARD - DAY

     Erin's Hyundai pulls up and stops in a cloud of dust.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            ... Incriminating records have a way of
            disappearing when people smell trouble.

     Erin hops out, checks her reflection in the side-view mirror,
     then heads into the building.

     INT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL COUNTY WATER BOARD - DAY

     Drab, government-issue.  ROSS, the bored desk clerk is
     thumbing his way through ROAD & TRACK.  Just as he stops to
     stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling
     the hood of a car, the huge door opens and Erin enters.

                               ERIN
            Whew!  Goddamn, that's a heavy door.

     Ross looks up.  It's like the girl from the ad walked right
     off the page.  He jumps up, to help her with the door.

                               ROSS
            Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.

                               ERIN
            Thank you very much.  Aren't you a
            gentleman?  Mr. ...

                               ROSS
            Ross.

                               ERIN
            Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.

     She smiles.  He can't believe his luck.

                               ROSS
            Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?

                               ERIN
            Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl
            for some water records.

                               ROSS
                        (with a laugh)
            You come to the right place.

                               ERIN
                        (laughing along)
            I guess I did.

                               ROSS
            You just tell me what you want to look at
            and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.

                               ERIN
            I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's
            fighting his water bill, and he wants me to
            find all manner of bills from all kinds of
            places.  The easiest thing would probably be
            if I just squeezed back there with you and
            poked around myself.  Would that be okay?

                               ROSS
            Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need
            you to sign in here --

     He hands her a pen.  He reads over her shoulder as she signs
     her name -- Erin Pattee Brockovich.

                               ROSS
            Pattee?  That your middle name?

                               ERIN
            Nope.  Maiden.

                               ROSS
                        (disappointed)
            You're married.

                               ERIN
            Not anymore.

     She smiles and winks at him, then goes around the counter
     with him and looks at the stacks and stacks of files.

                               ERIN
            Well.  Here goes nothing.

     She heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files.
     They're all town names -- Barstow, Victorville, Oro Grande,
     Helendale -- in no particular order.  Finally, Erin spots one
     that says Hinkley.  She pulls it down.

     IN THE FILE 

     are pages and pages of Xeroxed memoranda, letters, charts, 
     graphs, handwritten notes.  All shoved in willy-nilly. 

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     George is watching a football game on TV.  He's just put TV
     dinners on the floor in front of the Matt and Katie. 

                               MATT 
            Our mom gives us sandwiches on Fridays. 

                               GEORGE
            That's a sandwich. 

                               KATIE
            No, it's not! 

                               GEORGE
            Sure it is.  Here, I'll show you. 

     He picks up Matt's chicken, tears it in two ... 

                               GEORGE 
            Most people think a sandwich's gotta have 
            bread on the outside.  Not true.  Chicken is
            a perfectly good outside for a sandwich.

     ... then places the broccoli neatly between the halves. 

                               GEORGE
            See? 

     Katie and Matthew look at it, then up at George, and smile.
     This guy just might be all right, after all. 

     EXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT 

     It's gotten dark.  Erin's Hyundai's still there.

     INT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT 

     Erin is on the floor, her legs stretched out in front of her. 
     She has a bunch of files open and spread across the floor.
     The one in her hand has caught her attention. 

     INSERT ON THE PAPER 

     It's a memo titled "CLEAN-UP AND ABATEMENT ORDER" from the
     water board to PG&E.  Erin is concentrating hard on it,
     reading laboriously to herself. 

                               ERIN (O.S.) 
            "... On December 7, 1987, the discharger
            notified the regional board and the San
            Bernardino County Environmental Health 
            Services of the discovery of 0.58 ppm of
            hexavalent chromium in an on-site ground
            water monitoring well ..."
                        (beat)
            ... hexavalent ... 

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY 

     CLOSE ON A XEROX OF THE ABATEMENT ORDER.  WIDEN to see it is
     on top of a stack of papers that Erin is carrying as she
     enters the office.  She has an efficient air about her -- a
     sense of purpose. 

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY 

     Erin swoops in, ready to work, only to find her desk cleared
     off.  She turns to Anna, who's already hard at work. 

                               ERIN
            Where's my stuff? 

     Anna looks up. 

                               ANNA 
            Where've you been?

                               ERIN
            What the fuck did you do with my stuff? 

                               ANNA 
            Don't use language with me -- 

     But Erin's out the door before Anna can finish her sentence.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, JANE'S OFFICE - DAY

     JANE is at her desk.  Erin barrels in.

                               ERIN 
            Someone stole my stuff. 

                               JANE 
            Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you. 

                               ERIN 
            I had photos of my kids, plus a mug -- 

     Jane reaches under her desk for a box, looks through it.

                               JANE 
            -- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of
            hose.  Here. 

                               ERIN
            What's going on? 

                               JANE 
            There may be jobs where you can disappear
            for days at a time, but this isn't one of 
            them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you
            don't get to stay. 

     She hands her the box.  Erin doesn't take it. 

                               ERIN 
            I've been working.  Shit, that's all I've
            been doing.  Ask Mr. Masry.  He knows. 

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY 

     Ed's at his desk, dialing the phone when Erin barrels in.

                               ERIN 
            You said to fire me?

     He sets down the receiver. 

                               ED 
            Erin, you've been gone for a week. 

                               ERIN 
            I left a message.  I've been dealing with 
            that real estate thing.  I was gonna write 
            up a whole damn report and --

                               ED 
            That's not how we work here.  You don't just
            leave a message and take off.

     Jane follows her in, still carrying the box of stuff. 

                               ERIN 
            What am I supposed to do, check in every two
            seconds? 

                               JANE 
            Yes.  It's called accountability. 

                               ERIN 
            I am not talking to you, bitch. 

                               JANE
            Excuse me?

                               ED
            Okay, enough -- 
                        (beat) 
            Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I 
            don't think this is the right place for you.
            So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on 
            your behalf.  Find you something else, okay? 

                               ERIN
            Don't bother. 

     She turns to Jane, takes her box, and heads out. 

                               ED 
            Come on, I'm trying to help here. 

                               ERIN 
            Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty
            about firing someone with three kids to
            feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that. 

     And she leaves. 

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY 

     As Erin heads for the door, pleased glances fly from 
     secretary to secretary.  Erin reaches the door, but can't
     open it with the box in her arms.  She turns to the room. 

                               ERIN 
            I don't suppose any one of you cunts could
            open the fucking door for me. 

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY 

     Erin's Hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house.  Erin
     shoves open the creaky, reluctant door, lifts her box of
     stuff off the seat, and gets out. 

     As she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs
     into the MAILMAN.  He hands her a packet of mail. 

                               MAILMAN 
            Here ya go, Miz Brockovich. 

     Erin looks at the top of the stack.  It's the electric bill.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY 

     Erin enters, puts down the box and stares at the mail. 
     Bills, bills, and more bills.  As she throws them on the
     table, she sees George coming out of the kitchen.

                               ERIN
            What are you doing here? 

                               GEORGE 
            Fixing a leak under your sink. 

     She heads into the kitchen, weary and irritated. 

                               ERIN 
            I didn't ask you to do that.  Damn it, 
            George, I don't ask you to do things like
            that. 

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 

     Erin enters, sees all the cleaning stuff from under the sink
     is spread around the kitchen floor.  A tool box lies open. 

                               ERIN
            Great. 

                               GEORGE
            I'm gonna clean it up. 

     Erin gets down on her knees and starts putting things away. 

                               GEORGE 
            Relax, Erin, I'll do it -- I'm not --

     Before he can finish, a huge WATER BUG runs onto Erin's hand. 

                               ERIN
            Ugh -- Jesus -- 

     She jumps and brushes it off. 

                               GEORGE 
            Yeah -- you had a whole family of those
            things hanging out back there. 

     She takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug, missing it. 

                               ERIN
            Damn it -- 

     The bug skitters away from her, along the floorboard.  Erin
     chases it, smacking at it repeatedly, missing it every time. 

                               GEORGE
            Don't worry about it, I'll get it later. 

     But Erin keeps after it, corralling all her frustrations into
     killing that one bug. 

                               ERIN 
            Come here, you little motherfucker --

     The bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt,
     the pepper, the napkin holder.  Erin keeps after it, BANGING
     the table harder and harder with each SMACK of her shoe.

                               GEORGE
            Hey, whoa -- relax --
         
     The salt and pepper skid off the table.  The napkins fly from
     their holder.  Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips
     into a crack in the wall and disappears.  Erin hurls her shoe
     at the crack.  It SMASHES into the wall.

                               ERIN
            GOD DAMN IT!

     As Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts
     to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears.
     She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her.
         
                               ERIN
                        (almost a whisper)
            ... God damn it.
         
     She looks around at her for-shit kitchen and starts to cry.
         
                               ERIN
            What kind of person lives like this?  Huh?
            What kind of person lets her kids run around
            in a house crawling with bugs the size of
            housecats?
         
                               GEORGE
            It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them.
            All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
         
                               ERIN
            I can't call an exterminator.  I can't afford
            one.  God, I can't even afford my phone.
                        (beat)
            I got fired.
         
                               GEORGE
            What?  But you been working so hard --
         
                               ERIN
            Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of
            difference.
                        (then, fragile)
            Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me?
            How'd I end up so ... so nothing?
         
     George picks a napkin up off the floor, hands it to her.

                               GEORGE
            You're not nothing, Erin.

                               ERIN
            Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I
            was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of
            those great lives, with everything all laid-
            out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss
            Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you
            that?  You live next door to a real live
            beauty queen.
                        (wipes her nose)
            I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I
            thought it meant something.  I thought it
            meant I was gonna do something great with my
            life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow
            up to be someone.
         
                               GEORGE
            You are someone.

                               ERIN
            No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.

                               GEORGE
            You're someone to me.
                        (beat)
            You're someone real special to me.
         
     He takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her, very
     close.  He takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on
     her foot.  Then he takes her hands in his and kisses them.
         
                               ERIN
            I'm no good, George.  I make people
            miserable.
         
     But he kisses her anyway.  And for the first time in so long,
     she feels like something other than a failure.  He pulls her
     into him, and she lets herself be pulled.
         
     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - DAY
         
     Erin and George are in bed, naked, curled around each other.

                               GEORGE
            Man.  Even your earlobes are beautiful.
         
     He kisses one.
         
                               ERIN
            Don't be too nice to me, okay?  It makes me
            nervous.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
         
     Ed is at his desk.  The PHONE RINGS.  And RINGS.  And RINGS.

                               ED
            Brenda!
                        (no answer)
            BRENDA!

     Nothing.  Ed growls in frustration, then gets the phone.

                               ED
            Yeah, Ed Masry here ... She doesn't work
            here anymore.  Who's this?
         
     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
         
     CLOSE ON THE TABLE, where Beth is bobbing in her baby chair.
     On one side of her is a heap of bills with "PAST DUE" and
     "PLEASE REMIT" stamped on them.  On the other, the well-
     thumbed CLASSIFIED SECTION, with circles and X's all over it.

     The DOORBELL rings.  Erin swoops in and picks up Beth.

                               ERIN
            Come on, baby.  Maybe that's Ed McMahon.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY
         
     Erin carries Beth over to the front door, spies through the
     peephole, and sees Ed standing there.  She opens the door.
         
                               ERIN
            What are you doing here?

                               ED
            I got an interesting call this afternoon.
            It was from a Dr. Frankel.
         
                               ERIN
            Oh, yeah?

                               ED
            He wanted you to know the legal limit for
            hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per
            million.  And that at the rate you
            mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for
            the cancers in that family you asked about.
            The Irvings.
         
                               ERIN
            Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny
            how some people go out of their way to help
            people and others just give 'em the ax?

                               ED
            Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just
            assumed you were off having fun.

                               ERIN
            Now, why in the hell would you assume that?

                               ED
            I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like
            someone who has a lot of fun.

                               ERIN
            Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
         
     Ed takes a beat, copping to the charge.
         
                               ED
            So what's the story on this thing?  This
            cancer stuff?
         
                               ERIN
            You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I
            got a lot of bills to pay.
         
     He glares at her.  Realizes he has no choice.
         
                               ED
            Fine.
         
     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER
         
     Erin has let Ed in.  They're sitting.
         
                               ED
            But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
         
                               ERIN
            They told her something, but it can't have
            been too specific, cause I talked to her,
            and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
         
                               ED
            So what made you think it was?
         
                               ERIN
            It doesn't take a genius to look at those
            medical records and think something's wrong.

                               ED
            What medical records?

                               ERIN
            The ones in the box of files.
                        (off Ed's blank look)
            The box of files?  The one from your office?

                               ED
            I didn't see any medical records in there.

                               ERIN
            Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it
            then, huh?
                        (to herself)
            And you fired me.  Jesus.
         
     Ed thinks for a moment.

                               ED
            That document you found, the one that says
            it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen
            to make a copy did you?

                               ERIN
            Course I did.

                               ED
            Lemme see it, will you?

     Before getting it for him, she looks at him, weighs her odds.
         
                               ERIN
            I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including
            dental.
         
                               ED
            Look, Erin, this is not the way I do
            business, this extortion nonsense.
         
     Erin doesn't budge.
         
                               ED
            Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
         
                               ERIN
            Ten.
                        (off his look)
            There's a lot of other places I could work.
         
                               ED
            A ten percent raise and benefits.  But
            that's it.  I'm drawing the line.

     She goes to her box of stuff from the office and digs out the
     document for him.  He scans it.
         
                               ED
            This is the only thing you found?

                               ERIN
            So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I
            wouldn't be surprised if there's more.

                               ED
            Find out.

     EXT. 10 FREEWAY - DAY

     Erin's Hyundai zips along the freeway.  "Funky Town" is
     blaring from the tinny stereo.  Over it:

                               MATTHEW (O.S.)
            I hate this music.

     INT. HYUNDAI - DAY

     Erin's driving.  Matthew's in the front seat.  Katie and Beth
     (in a car seat) are in the back.

                               ERIN
            There's no way a son of mine hates Funky
            Town.  It's impossible.

                               MATTHEW
            Well I hate it.

                               KATIE
            I hate it too.  I hate this trip.

                               ERIN
            Oh, come on, where's your sense of
            adventure?  We're going someplace you never
            been before.

                               KATIE
            I'm gonna hate it.

                               MATTHEW
            Me too.

     She glances at them, frowns a little.

                               ERIN
            You know what I'm realizing for the first
            time?  You kids are a couple of downers.  I
            mean, you are the real thing -- a couple of
            honest-to-God depresso-types.
                        (small smile)
            Who in the heck raised you, anyway?  Some
            kind of moron?
         
     Katie smiles a little.  She likes this side of her mom.
         
                               KATIE
            Yeah.  A real moron.

                               ERIN
            Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired,
            bimbo, I bet.

                               MATTHEW
                        (also smiling)
            Yeah.

                               ERIN
            Thank God we got you away from her, huh?

     By now they're all smiling.  Funky Town plays on.

     EXT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY

     The Hyundai is parked at the entrance to the station, by a
     row of dead trees.  Erin is standing beside a sign that says
     "Private Property.  No Trespassing", taking pictures of the
     massive structure in the distance.  Matthew, Katie, and Beth
     are drawing in the dirt with sticks.

                               ERIN
            Stay out of the road.  I'll be right back.

     She wanders up the drive, onto PG&E property, moving around
     the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle.

     As she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the
     plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and
     notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue.
     She looks at the dirt right her feet.  Kicks the ground.

     Below the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green.  Erin
     notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt.
     Worry comes over her face.  She heads back to them.

     EXT. HINKLEY MART - DAY

     The kids are waiting at the car.  Erin comes out of the store
     with a bottle of water and uses it to rinse off their hands.

     EXT. WATER BOARD - DAY

     The sound of a BABY CRYING.  The Hyundai's parked in front.

                               MATTHEW (O.S.)
            I'm hungry.

     INT. WATER BOARD - DAY

     Erin is at the Xerox machine, copying a file while she tries
     to calm Beth.  There's a stack of files on the nearby table.
     Matthew and Katie are flopping around on the floor.

                               ERIN
            We'll go eat in a minute.  Settle down.

     Whining, fussing.  Ross goes over to her.

                               ROSS
            You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time
            here.  Why don't you let me do that for you,
            and you can get your kids some dinner.

                               ERIN
            Ross -- you are an absolute angel.

     She hands Ross the STACK OF DOCUMENTS.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY

     Ed comes in in the morning, and without pausing, hands Brenda
     a copy of the STACK OF DOCUMENTS, with a Post-it on the top.

                               ED
            Fax these to this number, okay?

                               BRENDA
            All of 'em?

                               ED
            All of them.

     He continues into his office and closes the door.

     CLOSE ON THE FAX MACHINE LED

     Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up on
     the LED: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.

     INT. IRVING HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Another copy of those DOCUMENTS, now in Donna's hands.  She's
     on her couch with Erin, reading them.  Outside, Donna's two
     daughters are playing in the pool.  She reads the last page
     and looks up at Erin, bewildered.

                               DONNA
            An on-site monitoring well?  That means --

                               ERIN
            It was right up on the PG&E property over
            there.

                               DONNA
            And you say this stuff, this hexavalent
            chromium -- it's poisonous?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.

                               DONNA
            Well -- then it's gotta be a different than
            what's in our water, cause ours is okay.
            The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right
            in the kitchen and said it was fine.

                               ERIN
            I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking
            to?  He gave me a list of problems that can
            come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And
            everything you all have is on that list.

     Donna resists this idea hard.

                               DONNA
            No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the
            doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely
            nothing to do with the other.

                               ERIN
            Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by
            PG&E?

     Donna sits quietly, trying to make sense of this.  The only
     sound is the LAUGHING and SPLASHING from the pool out back.
     Then, gradually, Donna realizes what it is she's hearing --
     her kids playing in toxic water.  She jumps up ...

                               DONNA
            ASHLEY!  SHANNA!

     ... and runs out to the pool.  Erin follows her.

     EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY

     From the door, Erin watches Donna run to the edge of the pool
     in a frantic response to this news.

                               DONNA
            OUT OF THE POOL!  BOTH OF YOU, OUT OF THE
            POOL, RIGHT NOW!

                               SHANNA
            How come?

                               DONNA
            CAUSE I SAID SO, THAT'S WHY, NOW GET OUT!
            OUT!  NOW!!!

     Erin watches compassionately as Donna flails to get her kids
     out of the contaminated water.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     It's morning.  Ed is checking the lie of his tie in his
     reflection in the window.  Erin is on his couch, high-heeled
     legs stretched out in front of her.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

     Jane is delivering paychecks.  When Brenda gets to her desk,
     Jane tips her head toward Ed's office, as if to say, check it
     out.  Brenda peers in and sees Erin.

                               BRENDA
            What's she doing here?
         
                               JANE
            He hired her back.  With a raise.

                               BRENDA
            What??  Why?

                               JANE
            Well, let's see.  It's not cause she's
            smart, and it's not cause she's
            professional.  That leaves ...

     Brenda's stunned.  Takes a beat.  Makes assumptions.

                               BRENDA
            And dumb old me thought working hard and
            being loyal was the way to get ahead.

     INT. ED'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Ed is still checking his reflection.

                               ED
            I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the
            fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed
            that send button -- PG&E claims department
            is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.

                               ERIN
            So you think we got 'em scared?

                               ED
            It sure as hell sounded like they were
            sitting up and taking notice.

     Brenda pops her head in, ignores Erin.

                               BRENDA
            David Baum from PG&E is at reception.
         
     Erin feels the chill Brenda's sending her way.

                               ERIN
            Nice to see you again, too, Brenda.

     Brenda leaves without acknowledging Erin.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     Ed and Erin come out and see DAVID BAUM waiting at reception.
     Forget law school, this kid looks like he's just out of
     twelfth grade.  Not a hair on his chin.  His suit and shoes
     look brand new.

                               ERIN
            Not to question your judgment or anything,
            Mr. Masry, but -- that doesn't exactly look
            like sitting up and taking notice to me.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Ed and Erin are seated across the table from Baum. To say
     this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement.  He
     doesn't talk; he squeaks.

                               BAUM
            ... in the interest of putting this whole
            thing to rest, PG&E is willing to offer the
            Irvings 250,000 dollars for their home.

     Ed laughs a little in disbelief.

                               ED
            250,000?

                               BAUM
            In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr.
            Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.

                               ED
            What about in terms of medical expenses?
            250,000 doesn't come close to what this
            family's gonna have to spend on doctors.

                               BAUM
            I understand they've had a bad run of luck,
            health-wise, and they have my sympathies.
            But that's not PG&E's fault.

                               ED
            You're kidding, right?
                        (Baum doesn't answer)
            Look at these readings for Christ's sake.
            PG&E's own technicians documented toxic
            levels of hexavalent chromium in those test
            wells, on numerous occasions.

     Ed shoves them across the table.  Baum doesn't look at them.

                               ED
            Everything the Irvings have had is a proven
            reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium.
            They've had ...

     He stalls a moment.  Erin jumps in.

                               ERIN
            -- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's
            disease, immune deficiencies, asthma,
            chronic nosebleeds.

     Despite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously
     the party line:

                               BAUM
            A million things could have caused those
            problems.  Poor diet, bad genes,
            irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final
            and more than fair.

                               ED
            Wait a minute -- I thought we were
            negotiating here.

                               BAUM
            250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.

     Ed looks across at this pissant little kid.

                               ED
                        (to himself)
            Jesus Christ.
                        (he stands, to leave)
            I will present your offer to my clients.  I
            doubt they'll accept it.

     As Ed starts out:

                               BAUM
            Mr. Masry, before you go off on some
            crusade, you might want to remember who it
            is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28-
            billion dollar corporation.

                               ED
                        (containing his anger)
            Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.

     And Ed leaves the conference room.  Erin follows him out.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     Erin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office.

                               ERIN
            At least they made an offer.

                               ED
            That wasn't an offer.  A million would've
            been an offer.  When they send the God damn
            mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my
            time, it's a fuck you.

                               ERIN
            I don't get why they'd do that.

                               ED
            Because they can.  You heard that kid --
            they have 28 billion dollars at their
            disposal.  They can afford to waste all the
            time in the world.

                               ERIN
            And you can't?

                               ED
            What, you think I'm made of money?

     Behind them, Baum steps out of the conference room.

                               BAUM
            Hey, you know where I can get a cab?  My
            plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes.

     Ed turns and looks at him.  He gets a tiny smile.

                               ED
            Tell you what, why don't you go on over to
            reception, tell them I said Mario should
            take you to the airport.

                               BAUM
            Hey, excellent.  Thanks.

     Baum heads out to the reception area.

                               ERIN
            Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the
            bathroom.  They'll be driving around the
            valley for hours.

                               ED
                        (gleeful)
            Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?

     She watches him go into his office, impressed.  Big smile.

                               ERIN
            Well I'll be God damned.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     End of the day.  Most everyone has left.  Erin is at her new
     work space near Ed's office.  She's poring over a fat file of
     documents.  ROSALIND wanders by with her coat on.

                               ROSALIND
            You've been reading for hours.

                               ERIN
            I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact
            that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".

                               ROSALIND
            Hey, just so long as you see Him.

     Rosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out.

     Outside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to
     a lost-looking COUPLE IN THEIR MID-30's.  These are MANDY and
     TOM BROWN.  He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope
     under his arm.  Rosalind points to Erin.  The Browns enter
     the office and approach her.

                               MANDY
            Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  Who are you?

                               TOM
            I'm Tom Brown.  This is my wife Mandy.  We
            used to live across the street from the
            Irvings.  PG&E bought our house last year.

     INT. ERIN'S DESK - LATER
         
     CLOSE ON photos of chickens, each with a twisted, limp neck.

                               TOM
            It's called wry neck.  It's when they're
            born without any muscles in the neck.

     WIDEN to see Erin looking at them with Tom and Mandy.

                               ERIN
            Wow.  How many were born like this?

                               TOM
            Twelve, maybe thirteen.

                               MANDY
            When Donna told us about you, and what you
            told her about the chromium, we figured that
            might have something to do with this, too.

                               ERIN
            It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.

     She tucks them into a file, as if that's it.

                               MANDY
            There's something else, too.

                               ERIN
            What?

                               TOM
            Well.  Mandy here's had nine miscarriages.

                               ERIN
            Are you kidding?  My God --

                               MANDY
            I know.  It's an awful lot.

                               ERIN
            I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.

                               TOM
            She doesn't know.  No one does.  It's not
            something you want to talk about, you know?

                               MANDY
            I figured it musta been something I did,
            like when I smoked marijuana, maybe.  Or
            took birth control pills.  But then Donna
            told me you thought this chromium might be
            to blame for her problems, so I figured ...

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Matt and Katie are in bed, with the light off.  Erin comes
     in, quietly, in clothes from work.

                               ERIN
            Hey.  You guys still awake?

     CLOSE ON MATT AND KATIE.  They're awake and pissed.

                               ERIN
            Come on, now.  No faking.  George told me he
            just shut out the light a few seconds ago.

     They still don't answer.  She comes in and sits on a bed.

                               ERIN
            Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this
            job is, things come up at the last minute,
            real important things, and I gotta deal with
            them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner
            any more than you do, but we're all gonna
            have to get used to it, cause the fact is,
            it's gonna happen sometimes.

                               KATIE
            It happens all the time.

                               ERIN
            That's not true; we had dinner together just
            last night.

                               MATT
            You were reading the whole time.

     He's got a point there.  Erin feels like shit.

                               ERIN
            I'm sorry, pumpkins.  I'll try a whole lot
            harder to be around, okay?  I promise.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The room is dark.  Erin enters and flops down onto the bed,
     exhausted.  George is lying on the bed next to her.

                               GEORGE
            If it's any consolation, I love you.

     EXT. ROUTE 10, INLAND EMPIRE - DAY

     Dry, flat California.  Ed's big old Mercedes is toodling down
     the freeway, at an overly safe, almost-geriatric speed.

     INT. ED'S MERCEDES - DAY

     Frank Sinatra is playing on the stereo.  Ed is swaying in
     time.  This is his kind of music.  He smiles, looks at Erin.

                               ED
            It's Sinatra's world, we just live in it.

     Whatever.  Erin glances at the speedometer.  Oy.  So slow.
     His car phone rings.  He picks it up.

                               ED
            Hello? ...
                        (his voice softens)
            Hi, babys.  Baby's fine.  Yes, I did.  I
            did, too, you just didn't feel it.

     He starts swerving across the lane markers.  THWACK THWACK
     THWACK.  Ed doesn't notice.  Erin's getting nervous.

                               ED
            You think I could leave without kissing my
            babys?  Okay, here you go.

     He kisses into the phone.  Swerves.  A car barely misses
     them.  Erin's eyes widen.  Not fun at all.

                               ED
            Bye-bye ... bye-bye ... no, you.  Okay,
            together.  Bye-bye.

     He finally hangs up, smiling to himself.  Erin clears her
     throat.

                               ERIN
            Um -- you mind pulling over?  Just -- for a
            second?

     EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

     The Mercedes pulls to a stop on the shoulder.  Erin gets out,
     walks around to the driver's side.  Opens the door.

                               ERIN
            First of all, don't talk baby talk to your
            wife in front of me.  It really undermines
            your authority.  And second, I know you're
            my boss and all, but you are the worst
            fucking driver I've ever seen.  Move over or
            I quit.

     He moves over.  She gets in, turns off the Sinatra.  They
     pull back out onto the freeway in silence.

     EXT. MANDY BROWN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The Mercedes and a truck are parked out front.

                               PETE (O.S.)
            There's something about this whole thing I
            don't quite understand, Mr. Masry.

     INT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Donna and Pete Irving, and Mandy and Roy Brown are all
     seated, sipping iced tea.  While they talk, Erin hands them
     all information packets on chromium.  Ed is standing in front
     of them, a little stiff.

                               PETE
            If PG&E messed with our water, why would
            they bother saying anything about it to us?
            Why not just keep quiet about it?

                               ED
            To establish a statute of limitations.  See,
            in a case like this, you only have a year
            from the time you first learn about the
            problem to file suit.  So PG&E figures,
            we'll let the cat out of the bag -- tell the
            people the water's not perfect; if we can
            ride out the year with no one suing, we'll
            be in the clear forever.

                               DONNA
            But it was more than a year ago that they
            told us --

                               ED
            It's okay.  We're not suing.  All we're
            doing is using this information to get you
            a real nice purchase price on your house,
            and get you two --
                        (to the Browns)
            -- a comparable retroactive bonus added to
            your sale price.  This way, and PG&E can
            still look good to their shareholders, cause
            they're not involved in an ugly lawsuit; all
            they're doing is buying a little property.

     Roy looks up from his retainer agreement.

                               ROY
            It doesn't say here how much this whole
            thing's gonna cost us.

                               ED
            My fee's forty percent of whatever you get
            awarded.

     Erin watches them look around at each other, stunned by the
     figure.

                               ERIN
            Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I
            heard that number, I said you got to be
            kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?

                               ED
            Erin --

                               ERIN
            I'm the one who's injured, and this joker
            who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk
            away with almost half my reward?

                               ED
            Erin --

     Erin's enjoying Ed's discomfort almost too much to stop.  But
     just almost.  She shifts gears.

                               ERIN
            Then I asked him how much he makes if I
            didn't get anything.

     They look at Ed.  Well?

                               ED
            Then I don't get anything either.

                               ERIN
            And I realized, he's taking a chance too.

     When they hear this, and realize he's in it with them, they
     all reach for their pens and sign.   They hand the agreements
     over to Erin, who takes them across the room to Ed.  He
     stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up.  That's that.

                               ED
            All right, then.  Let's hit the road.

     Boy.  Cold as ice.  Erin stares at him, stunned by his
     brusque manner, then leans in to him, close.

                               ERIN
                        (whispering)
            Mr. Masry, if you don't mind my saying, you
            got a lot to learn about being friendly.
            These people just hired you as their lawyer.
            The least you could do is make a little
            pleasant conversation.

     She gives him a stern look, then turns toward the women.
         
                               ERIN
            Donna, let me help you clean all this up.

     She picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the
     kitchen.  Donna and Mandy follow, leaving Ed alone with Pete
     and Roy.  He stands there, awkwardly.  Then, finally:

                               ED
            So, what's, uh ... what's new?

     INT. DONNA'S KITCHEN - DAY

     Erin and Donna are putting away the cleaned glasses.  Mandy
     is scanning the chromium pamphlet Erin gave her.

                               MANDY
            You know that thing it says in here about
            rashes?

                               ERIN
            Uh-huh?

                               MANDY
            Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood
            -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed
            like someone in his family always had a rash
            somewhere or other.  I just figured it was
            something in the genes.  And you know how it
            is -- you don't like to ask about things
            like that ...

     Erin listens, interested.

     EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY, BARN - DAY

     Another day.  BOB LINWOOD, 40's and gruff, is in the barn,
     tossing hay around.

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            Excuse me.  Are you Mr. Linwood?

     He sees Erin picking her way toward him in her high-heels.

                               LINWOOD
            Yeah?

                               ERIN
            I'm Erin Brockovich.  I work at the law firm
            that represents your former neighbors the
            Browns.  They suggested I give you a call.

     She steps in a cow patty.  Laughs at herself good-naturedly.

                               ERIN
            Boy howdy, did I ever wear the wrong shoes.

     EXT. THE DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY

     CLOSE ON A SIGN that reads: THE DESOTOS, hanging on the side
     of a small, paint-chipped house.  Erin is at the door talking
     to MARY DESOTO, 65, who's wearing a big cross at her breast.

                               ERIN
            ... and Mr. Linwood seemed to think that
            your husband had been sick as well.

                               MARY
            Yes, Mr. DeSoto has lung cancer.  Never
            smoked a day in his life, neither.

     INT. LAURA AND MIKE AMBROSINO'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin is talking to MIKE and LAURA AMBROSINO -- 30's.  Solid,
     family folks.  But Laura's left brow and cheekbone look
     swollen and misshapen, and she's trying to hide the fact that
     she's in a lot of pain.

                               ERIN
            Mrs. DeSoto said she wasn't sure exactly
            what it was that you had --

                               PETE
            She's not alone on that one.

                               LAURA
            Well, they know what it is -- it's called
            fibrous dysplasia --

                               PETE
            The bones start growing again.  Gives her
            headaches like you wouldn't believe.

                               LAURA
            -- they just don't know what caused it.

     INT. RITA AND TED DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY

     Erin is talking to TED AND RITA DANIELS.  Their daughter
     ANNABELLE, 10, is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket.

                               ERIN
            ... then Mike Ambrosino remembered seeing
            you folks at the hospital from time to time
            too, so I thought I'd just stop by.
                        (to Annabelle)
            You must be Annabelle.

                               ANNABELLE
            Uh-huh.

                               ERIN
            Whew, are you ever a beauty.  I mean, you
            must drive those boys crazy.

     Annabelle smiles a little.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Late night.  George rolls over -- Erin's side of the bed is
     empty.  He checks the clock, then gets up and heads into:

     INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     He peers around and spots her, sitting in the little kid's
     chair in Matthew and Katie's room.

     Erin is holding Beth, watching Matt and Katie sleep.  Erin
     hears the floor creak as George steps into the doorway.

                               ERIN
            Tell me something, George.  What kind of God
            lets a beautiful little 10-year-old girl get
            brain cancer?  Isn't He supposed to be in
            charge of stuff like that?  Make sure it
            doesn't happen?
                        (beat)
            I swear, any other job, He'd be fired.

     EXT. VALLEY SIDEWALK - DAY

     Ed and Erin are walking down the street, take-out coffee cups
     in their hands.  Ed is sipping his, but Erin is in too much
     of a lather to drink hers.

                               ED
            Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.

                               ERIN
            That's crazy -- why not?

                               ED
            Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason
            PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a
            quiet little real estate dispute.  We add
            plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle
            of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem --
            against a massive utility.  No, thank you.

     They go into their office building.

     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

     Erin and Ed are riding up.

                               ERIN
            Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up
            to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest
            people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend
            every single day watching their little girl
            fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll
            tell them we can't help them cause you don't
            feel like working that hard.

                               ED
            It's not about working hard --

                               ERIN
            Bullshit.

                               ED
            -- It's about being realistic.  Something
            like this, Erin -- it could take forever.
            They're a huge corporation.  They'd
            completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just
            one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.

                               ERIN
            -- who happens to know they poisoned people
            and lied about it.

     The doors open.  Ed gets off.  Erin follows.

     INT. MASRY LAW OFFICE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

     Erin's dogging Ed down the hall, to the office.

                               ERIN
            And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not
            only does it attack every organ of the body,
            it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means
            these people's genes, and the genes of their
            kids, and the genes of their grandkids --

                               ED
            I know how DNA works, Erin --

     He gets to the Masry & Vititoe doors.  Opens them.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY

     Erin tails Ed back to his office.

                               ERIN
            We can get these people.  With a little
            effort, I really think we can nail their
            asses to the wall.

                               ED
            Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise,
            you believe that?

                               ERIN
            Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit.
            But I know the difference --

     He shuts his office door on her.

                               ERIN
            -- BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG!

     INT. ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ed goes over to his desk, sits down.  He sees a stack of
     messages there, starts flipping through them.  Then he stops.

                               ED
            Damn it.

     He shoves the messages aside and puts his head in his hands.
     He sits like that for a moment, GROANS to himself.  Then he
     pushes himself up and heads over to his door.

     When he opens it, he finds Erin still standing there, exactly
     where he left her, arms crossed.  She hasn't budged.

                               ED
            How many families we talking about here?

                               ERIN
            Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.

                               ED
            You think there's more?

                               ERIN
            Well -- I found one document at the water
            board that had a toxic test well reading
            from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have
            lived on that land since then.

     Ed pauses, groans again, realizing what decision he's making.

                               ED
            This is a whole different ball game, Erin.
            A much bigger deal.

                               ERIN
            Kinda like David and what's-his-name?

                               ED
            Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole
            fucking family.
                        (heavy sigh)
            Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if,
            you find me the evidence to back all this up
            -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.

     She smiles victoriously.

                               ERIN
            You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.

                               ED
            Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm
            filing for bankruptcy.

     He heads back to his desk.  Erin follows him into his office.

                               ERIN
            Course, gathering evidence -- now, that's a
            big job.  A hell of a lot bigger than just
            filing.  I'm gonna be working a lot harder
            now, taking on a lot more responsibility ...

     He gives her a look.  Knows what's coming.

                               ED
            What now?

                               ERIN
            Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all
            the time I'm gonna be spending on the road,
            I'll probably be needing my own cel phone,
            won't I?

     INT. TOYS 'R' US - DAY

     CLOSE ON A BEEPING CEL PHONE

     as Erin tries to program numbers into its speed dial.  WIDEN
     to see she is reading from the phone's manual as she enters
     Toys 'R' Us with George, Matthew, Katie and Beth.

                               ERIN
            You each can pick out four things.  But
            nothing huge.  Look at the price.  Nothing
            crazy.

     Matthew and Katie fan out into the store.  Erin keeps messing
     with the phone.

                               GEORGE
            You can buy 'em all the toys you want, but
            come Monday, when you split again, they're
            still gonna be pissed.

     Erin looks over at him, weary.

                               ERIN
            George, I am just trying to do something
            nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could
            you please not give me a hard time about it?

                               GEORGE
            One toy per kid is doing something nice.
            Four is ... something else.

                               ERIN
            Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh?
            They're scarred for life.  They're gonna
            start holding up 7-11's any day now.

                               GEORGE
            I'm just saying --

                               ERIN
                        (with intensity)
            I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna
            hear it.  I am doing the best I can.

     And she walks away from him.

     EXT. HINKLEY, ROADSIDE DITCH - DAY

     Erin, in high heels and miniskirt, is straddling a ditch,
     scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic
     containers.  Over this:

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            Dr. Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich.  Tell me
            something: if I wanna find as much evidence
            of hexavalent chromium contamination as I
            possibly can, what should I do?

     As Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side
     of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk.

     EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - NIGHT

     Erin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked
     "No Trespassing".  Her arms are full of more containers.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            Well, what you have to remember is, if you
            have hex chrom in the water, you have it in
            anything that lived off the water.

     She adds them to a growing collection of containers in the
     trunk of her car.

     EXT. HINKLEY, THE POOL BEHIND AN ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

     Another day.  This time it's RAINING.  Erin minces her way
     down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            What I'd do is start a collection.  Anything
            that existed in water, on water, under water
            ...

     She gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of
     rancid pool water and seals it.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            anything that had water flow over or under
            it ...

     Erin spots a few dead frogs in the water.  She picks one up
     by the leg, and seals it in a plastic bag as well.

     EXT. WELL - DAY

     With a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up
     over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against
     one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts
     shimmying down the well.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            anything that had water pass through it ...

     INSIDE THE WELL

     she winces at the algae and gook that's clinging to her as
     she descends to the water level.  When she's low enough, she
     takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY

     Erin's at her desk, bending over her notebook in a miniskirt,
     adding reports to the TOXICOLOGY binder.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            ... collect 'em, label 'em, then bring 'em
            to me.  I'll analyze 'em, see what we got.

     ON THE REPORTS: We catch a few words: "water sample A ...",
     "soil sample D ...", "frog sample A ...", "... traces of
     hexavalent ..."

     Brenda looks at Erin and sees her hem rising in the back.

                               BRENDA
            For God's sake, Erin, I can see your
            panties.

     Erin turns to Brenda, relishing the chance to irritate her.

                               ERIN
            Liar.  I'm not wearing any.

     Ed, in his office, laughs.  He's starting to like this gal.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     It's a hot night.  George is playing on the floor with the
     kids.  Erin is behind them on the couch, laboriously reading
     a book labeled, simply, CHROMIUM.  The phone RINGS.  Erin
     picks it up.

                               ERIN
            Hello?

                               MALE VOICE (O.S.)
            Is this the Erin Pattee Brockovich that's
            been snooping around the water board?

     His voice is flat, creepy.  Not friendly.

                               ERIN
            Yes.  Who's this?

     CLICK.  Erin stares at the phone, freaked.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

     George watches Erin double-checking the locks on the door.

                               ERIN
            I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone
            call, George.

                               GEORGE
            Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your
            bills, not put you in danger.

                               ERIN
            I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt.
            Remember?

     She goes to the living room, double-checks the window locks
     in there.  George follows.

                               GEORGE
            Look, don't take this the wrong way, but
            don't you think you might be out of your
            league here?

                               ERIN
            No, see -- that's exactly what those
            arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that
            because they got all this money and power,
            we don't stand a chance in hell against
            them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.

     She heads into the bedrooms.

                               GEORGE
            It doesn't have to be this complicated,
            Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.

                               ERIN
                        (off-hand)
            How would you know?

     George reacts, a little stung.  He follows her into:

     INT. MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Matt and Katie are asleep.  Erin is checking their windows.
     George comes in.  They whisper.

                               GEORGE
            You mind telling me what that's supposed to
            mean?

                               ERIN
            Nothing.

                               GEORGE
            If you got a problem with me taking care of
            your kids instead of getting some job, just
            say so.

                               ERIN
            I didn't say that.

                               GEORGE
            Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can
            start leaving the kids with the chicken fat
            lady again.  Would that make you happy?

                               ERIN
            Keep your voice down.

                               GEORGE
            I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I
            probably know it better than you.

     She gives him a glare, then leaves the room.

     INT. WATER BOARD - DAY

     Erin is reaching up to a high shelf for a dusty old box of
     files.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ross passing.

                               ERIN
            Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E
            pay you to cover their ass, or do you just
            do it out of the kindness of your heart?

                               ROSS
                        (a bad liar)
            I don't know what you're talking about.

                               ERIN
            The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee.
            That heavy-breathing sicko that called the
            other night could've only found out about me
            from you.
                        (beat)
            People are dying, Ross.  You got document
            after document here, right under your nose,
            that says why, and you haven't said word one
            about it.  I wanna know how the hell you
            sleep at night.

     Ross is speechless.  He just stands there.  Erin drags the
     box to the floor and goes to work.

     EXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT

     Erin's car is parked in front.  A DIRTY OLD PICK-UP comes
     rumbling up the road.  When its lights hit Erin's car, it
     slows, then pulls over.  The driver flicks on his BRIGHTS to
     get a better look at the car.  The truck sits there for a
     bit, a dark presence.  Then, as the headlights of another car
     appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out
     and drives off.

     INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - NIGHT

     A pile of documents is strapped into the passenger seat.  An
     empty coffee cup rolls around the floor.  Erin's driving,
     exhausted.  She yawns as she dials her phone.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            Hello?

     INTERCUT between Erin in her car, and George in bed.

                               ERIN
            I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the
            road.  Keep me awake, willya?

                               GEORGE
            What do you want, a joke?

                               ERIN
            No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me
            about your day.  What went on back there?

                               GEORGE
            Well, come to think of it, we did have a big
            event around here.  Beth started talking.

                               ERIN
            What?
                        (beat)
            Beth?  My Beth?

                               GEORGE
            Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and
            she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."

     Erin says nothing, just stares out at the empty highway,
     feeling all hollowed-out.

                               GEORGE
            I'd never seen that before -- someone's
            first word.  Pretty intense.

     Erin just nods.  Keeps staring straight ahead as a tear rolls
     down her cheek.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S AREA - DAY

     CLOSE ON SOME FILES as Erin hands them to Ed.  As he takes
     them from her, he notices a crematory urn on Erin's desk.

                               ED
            Is that what I think it is?

                               ERIN
            She lived on the plume.  You never know.
         
     Ed laughs and hands the documents to Brenda without looking
     at her.  She grumpily takes them over to the fax machine.

     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED as Brenda types in the number. The
     recipient's name comes up again: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.

     EXT. HINKLEY BARBECUE - DAY

     Open pits, pony rides, watermelon.  George is watching Katie
     and Matt being led around on ponies, an activity that stopped
     being fun hours ago.  Now they're just hot and tired.

     BY THE BARBECUE, Ed is talking to an OLDER COUPLE as they
     sign retainer agreements.

     ELSEWHERE, Erin, holding Beth, is looking at pictures of a
     swimming pool with FIVE OTHER WOMEN.  The water is green.

                               ERIN
            This was the community pool?

                               WOMAN 1
            Yeah, that PG&E built.  The whole time we
            thought it was algae that made it so green.

     LATER ...

     Erin's trunk is open.  She and Ed are clipping new clusters
     of retainer agreements into the "PLAINTIFFS" binder.

     LATER STILL ...

     Erin and Ed are passing out informational pamphlets.  She
     sticks one in a hand before noticing that it's George's.

                               GEORGE
            I'm bored, and so are the kids.

                               ERIN
            Just a few more minutes, then we can go.
                        (as he heads off)
            Take her, will you?

     George drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin.  He heads
     over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log.

     As he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he
     dropped.  It belongs to a MAN IN A BLACK JACKET.  He's in his
     50's, strong and sinewy.  Military-style dark glasses obscure
     his eyes.  He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working
     the crowd.  Watches her carefully.  He slides the pamphlet
     into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the DIRTY
     OLD PICK-UP TRUCK that idled in front of the Water Board.

     LATER STILL ...

     Erin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave,
     when Donna comes up to her, with A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in tow.

                               DONNA
            Erin, this here's Frank Melendez.  He works
            over at the compressor station --

     Erin stops in her tracks, very interested.

     LATER STILL ...

     Erin and Frank are on a bench, talking.  Out of the corner of
     her eye, she sees her car drive off.  George's hand sticks
     out the driver's side and flips her the bird.  She watches
     him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank.

                               ERIN
             I'm sorry.  What were you saying?

     LATER ...

     The barbecue is winding down.  Ed is heading for his
     Mercedes.  Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out.

                               ERIN
            I need a ride.

     INT. ED'S CAR - DAY

     Ed is driving.  He glances over at Erin, fuming in the
     passenger seat.  After a beat:

                               ED
            You wanna talk about --
         
                               ERIN
            No.

     Another beat.  Then Erin's cel phone rings.  She digs into
     her bag, pulling it out as fast as she can.  Answers.

                               ERIN
            What, asshole?

     There's a pause.  Then Mike Ambrosino's voice comes over the
     line, very strained:

                               MIKE AMBROSINO (O.S.)
            Um, Erin?  This is Mike.  Ambrosino.

     EXT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY

     The curtains are drawn; everything is dark.  Ed and Erin are
     at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired.
         
                               MIKE
            She was about to take a handful of these --

     He shows them a bottle of prescription pills.

                               MIKE
            It's a morphine thing -- for pain --

     Erin nods, then leaves Ed with Mike and heads toward:

     INT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

     Erin opens the door.  Very dark, very quiet.  Laura is lying
     in bed.  Erin goes over to her.  They speak in whispers.

                               LAURA
            I'm embarrassed.

                               ERIN
            That's okay.  I understand.

                               LAURA
            It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting
            worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be
            a good mother.

                               ERIN
            I'm real sorry, Laura.

     Erin sits down on the chair next to the bed.  Takes a beat.

                               LAURA
            Know what I always thought I wanted outta
            life, Erin?  A Jaguar.

                               ERIN
            Jaguar's a darn pretty car.

                               LAURA
            I thought if I could spend that kinda money
            on a car, it'd mean everything else was
            fine.
                        (beat)
            I don't even know how much they cost.

                               ERIN
            A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll
            get one.

     Laura shakes her head.

                               LAURA
            Wouldn't mean the same thing.

     Erin watches her sadly.

     INT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY

     A LOUD, industrial plant.  Erin and Frank Melendez walk
     through, him in coveralls, her in a teensy sun dress.  Both
     in hard-hats.  He's giving her a tour.

     EXT. NORTHRIDGE STREET - DAY

     George, in his leather and denim, is walking down the
     sidewalk.  As we WIDEN, we see he's pushing a PINK STROLLER.
     He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change.

     In the stroller, Beth starts to whine.  George reaches in his
     pocket, finds her pacifier.  As he's leaning down to give it
     to her, he hears a RUMBLE coming down the street behind him.
     The roar grows.  He stands, looks.  A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN
     BIKERS has pulled up next to him.  He looks at them.  They
     look at him, then at the stroller.  George feels ridiculous.

     When the light changes, the bikers REV LOUDLY and pull out.
     George just stands there and watches them go.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT

     His office is all about Hinkley.  A map of the plume area and
     a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant
     cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface;

     Erin is up at the map, eating Chinese food.

                               ERIN
            They used the hex chrom here, in these
            cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then
            they dumped it here, in these six ponds.

                               ED
            I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.

     She bites into a forkful of food, keeps talking.

                               ERIN
            They covered 'em over.  And not too
            carefully either, cause you dig one inch
            under the surface, and the dirt is green as
            a fucking shamrock.

                               ED
            And that's what caused the contamination?

                               ERIN
            It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's
            on the bottom.

     She reaches for a document, reads from it.

                               ERIN
            See, according to this, they were supposed
            to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep
            into the ground.  But guess what --

                               ED
            They skipped that step.

                               ERIN
            I guess it was a little too inconvenient.
            So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed
            into the groundwater, free as you please.

                               ED
            Jesus.
                        (beat)
            I don't even wanna ask what you did to make
            this Melendez guy talk.

     In response to the insinuation, Erin gives him a glare.

                               ERIN
            For your information, Frank cares what was
            in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half
            his day wading around them.  That was his
            job.

                               ED
            No shit.

                               ERIN
            No --

     Suddenly, her eyes pop out of her head --

                               ERIN
            SHIT!  SHIT!  Hot!  Hot!  Hot!

     Tears spring to her eyes.  She fans furiously at her mouth.
     Ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her.
     She takes a swig.  There's a nanosecond of relief ... until
     the tequila hits.  Her eyes redden.  She spews and gasps.

                               ERIN
            You ... asshole ...

     Ed chuckles.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - LATER

     The tequila's been dipped into.  Ed and Erin are each lying
     on a couch, staring at documents.  Late-night working.

                               ED
            Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da
            put three researchers on this, I wouldn't
            expect them to dig up all the information
            you got here.  This is some damn good work.
         
                               ERIN
            Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.

                               ED
            Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I
            haven't billed a minute of my time since I
            started on this case, so you can quit
            hitting me up like I'm rich or something.

     He gets up, grabs his trash can, and moves around the room
     with it, cleaning up all the Chinese food cartons.

                               ERIN
            Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty
            rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got
            those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.

                               ED
            We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the
            balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we
            can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers
            in San Francisco.

                               ERIN
            What do you mean?

                               ED
            PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way
            of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.

                               ERIN
            Oh, they knew.  They had to know.

                               ED
            Show me the document that proves that.

     She doesn't have one.

                               ED
            Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't
            know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages.
            And punitive damages is where the money is.

                               ERIN
            Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I
            work on this thing, the more I realize what
            a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here
            we got a company that poisoned a whole
            aquifer -- that built a pool for a town,
            then filled it with toxic water -- and we're
            the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving
            things?  That's just not right.

     Beat.  Ed smiles.


                               ED
            I like this case.

                               ERIN
            Really?  It makes me sick.

                               ED
            Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a
            long time since I had a case I cared about.

                               ERIN
            You didn't care about my case?

                               ED
            I would now.

     He gives her a long look.

                               ED
            Hey.  I like working with you.

                               ERIN
            Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you
            too.

     They both smile a little awkwardly.  Take a beat.  Then:

                               ED
            When'd you start calling me Ed?

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT

     The Christmas party.  The office is decorated; someone is
     Santa.  Erin and George enter, all dressed up.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Erin's giving George a guided tour.  As they head down the
     hall, every desk is decorated and has a present on it

                               GEORGE
            I'm just saying -- we have one night to
            ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?

                               ERIN
            Cause it's my office party.  If you had an
            office, I'd go to your party.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - NIGHT

     It's dark.  The door to Erin's area opens.

                               ERIN
            And here, ta-daa, is my desk.

     She flicks on the lights.  Brenda's desk is decorated and as
     a present on it.  Erin's is empty.

                               GEORGE
            Which one?
                        (it's obvious)
            Maybe they didn't think you were coming.

     Erin shakes her head.  She's surprised by how hurt she is.

                               ERIN
                        (quietly)
            God damn.  I work so hard.  The least they
            could do ...

     George looks over at her, sees her eyes glisten a little.  He
     goes over to her, wraps his arms around her.

                               GEORGE
            Hey.  Fuck 'em, babe.  Who needs 'em, huh?

     He kisses her.  She leans into him.  He kisses her some more.

                               GEORGE
                        (quietly)
            See?  All we need is each other.

     She kisses back.  She's gonna let him take care of her.  Some
     more kisses, heating up.  He slides her onto her empty desk.

                               GEORGE
            Good thing there isn't a present there, huh?
            That mighta hurt.

     She laughs a little.  He slides his hands up her skirt.  She
     pulls him into her, tugging his shirt out of his pants.

     INT. MASRY OFFICES, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Ed is coming down the hall with his wife, JOEY.  Joey is much
     younger than Ed, and very pretty.

                               ED
            I'll show you what we did back here --

     INT. ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT

     Erin and George, in a rapidly-heating-up clinch on her desk,
     hear the voices.  Erin pulls away.

                               ERIN
            That's Ed.

                               GEORGE
            Lock the door.

                               ERIN
            No, I wanna say hi.

     He pulls her back into him, not wanting to move.

                               GEORGE
            We'll say hi later.  Lock it.

     But Erin pulls away ...

                               ERIN
            Come on, George, it's a party.

     He watches her straighten her dress and take a step away from
     him.  It's just one step, but it feels a hell a lot farther.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER

     Erin and Ed are at the reception desk, talking and laughing.

     NEARBY, Joey and George are standing together, awkwardly.

                               JOEY
            Your wife's real pretty.

                               GEORGE
            She's not my wife.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Matthew lies awake in his bed, listening to George and Erin
     fight.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            It wouldn't kill you to talk about
            something other than yourself and your own
            fucking job once in a while --

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            What do you want to talk about instead?
            Your day?  That's a fascinating subject.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Erin and George are fighting while they get ready for bed.

                               GEORGE
            Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day
            trying to prove what hot shit I am --

                               ERIN
            That is not what I'm --

                               GEORGE
            Bullshit, Erin.  Bullshit.

     The fight is interrupted by the sound of BETH CRYING.

                               ERIN
            Great.  Excellent.  Thank you very much.

     She leaves the room.

     INT. BETH'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Beth is wailing in her crib.  Erin comes in in her nightshirt
     and lifts Beth out.  Then, more to herself than to Beth:

                               ERIN
            It's okay, baby.  It'll be okay.

     She runs her hand over Beth's head, then slides down the wall
     and crumples onto the floor.  As she curls around Beth, Erin
     starts to COUGH.  Deep, raspy coughs from way down low.

     EXT. PG&E STATION - NIGHT

     Late, late at night.  The plant is silent.  The property
     seems empty, until we notice Pete Irving standing alone
     inside the gates, staring up at the station.

     After a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant.
     It misses.  Not that it would do anything if it hit.  He
     reaches for another, throws it.  Then another, and another.
     He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant.  Then,
     overwhelmed by his impotence, he lets out a TERRIFYING YELL.

     INT. IRVINGS' HOUSE, DONNA'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Donna's sitting quietly in bed.  Erin is sitting on the edge
     of the bed.

                               DONNA
            I'd got so used to having 'em come up
            benign, I guess I just didn't expect it.

     She looks down her shirt front.

                               DONNA
            Sure wish I had longer to get used to the
            idea.
                        (beat)
            You think if you got no uterus, and no
            breasts, you're still technically a woman?

                               ERIN
            Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman,
            cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads
            and underwire.

     Donna smiles a little.  Then her face crumbles.

                               DONNA
            We're gonna get them, aren't we, Erin?  You
            gotta promise me we're gonna get them.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, DAY

     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED

     as DOCUMENTS are faxed once again to the PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.

     THEN AGAIN, on another day.

     AND AGAIN, on another day.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ed is once again checking the lie of his tie in a window.
     Erin is popping some aspirin, trying to kill a headache that
     has brought with it a healthy dose of intolerance.

                               ERIN
            If they've sent that little shmuck Baum
            again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.

                               ED
            From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd
            say they're taking us more seriously.

                               ERIN
            Yeah, I heard that one before.

     Brenda leans her head in.

                               BRENDA
            Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Webster, Mr. Buda, and Ms.
            Cooper, from PG&E are here.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

     Talk about moving up the food chain.  MS. SANCHEZ, MR.
     WEBSTER, MR. BUDA, and MR. COOPER mill slowly about the
     reception area like sharks.  They all ooze importance.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE OF ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Erin, Ed and Brenda are staring out at them.

                               ERIN
            Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.

                               ED
            They're trying to intimidate us.
                        (then, to Brenda)
            Tell them to wait in the conference room.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Sanchez, Webster, Buda, and Cooper are seated.

     The door opens and Ed enters, legal pad under his arm.
     Followed by Erin, legal pad under her arm.  Followed by Anna
     (looking professional in Brenda's suit coat), legal pad under
     her arm.  Followed by Mario (in a suit produced from who
     knows where), legal pad under his arm.  If you didn't know
     better, you'd assume it was a team of lawyers as well.

                               ED
            Counselors --

                               MR. SANCHEZ
            Counselors.

     Ed and Erin sit down and get to work.  Mario and Anna,
     clearly told to just follow along, sit down a moment later.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

     Mario and Anna are sitting mutely in their seats beside Ed
     and Erin, firing blank looks across the table.

                               SANCHEZ
            Let's be honest, here.  Two million dollars
            is more money than these people have ever
            dreamed of.

     Erin has no patience for this today.

                               ERIN
            Oh, see, now that pisses me off.  First of
            all -- we got more'n a hundred plaintiffs.
            They may not be sophisticated, but they do
            know how to divide, and two million dollars
            isn't shit when it's split between them.

     Mario and Anna exchange a look.  This is getting interesting.

                               ED
            Erin --

     But there's no stopping her.

                               ERIN
            And second of all -- these people don't
            dream about being rich.  They dream about
            being able to watch their kids swim in a
            pool without worrying they'll have to have a
            hysterectomy at age 20, like Rosa Diaz -- a
            client of ours -- or have their spine
            deteriorate like Stan Bloom.  Another client
            of ours.  So before you come back here with
            another lame-ass offer, I want you to think
            real hard about what your spine is worth,
            Mr. Buda -- or what you'd expect someone to
            pay you for your uterus, Miss Sanchez --
            then you take out your calculator and
            multiply that number by a hundred.  Anything
            less than that is a waste of our time.

     And she gets up and storms out of the meeting.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY

     Erin drinks a big swig of coffee and pops a few more aspirin.
     Beyond her, the PG&E lawyers are filing out of the office.
     Anna wanders over to Erin, a little uncomfortable.

                               ANNA
            Um, Erin?
                        (Erin turns)
            Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily
            my favorite person in the world ...
                        (beat)
            ... sometimes you're not half-bad.

                               ERIN
            I'm gonna assume that was meant as a
            compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT

     Erin's at her desk, which is completely buried in documents
     and files.  She's visibly exhausted, struggling to focus on
     the page, and COUGHING while she works.  Ed calls to her.

                                ED
            Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet
            you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.

                                ERIN
            D'you get his name?
                        (no answer)
            Course not.  Jesus, Ed --

                                ED
            He said he'd be at the gas station at six.

                                ERIN
            Boy, this job takes me to some of the best
            damn places, huh?

     EXT. HINKLEY GAS STATION - SUNSET

     Erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the
     bottle.  She checks her watch: 6:30.  The GAS STATION
     ATTENDANT comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights.

                                ERIN
            This is the only station in town, right?

                               ATTENDANT
            Yup.

     He gets in his car and drives off.  Erin sits down again.
     Looks down the road in both directions.  Nothing.

     Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint
     of chrome.  She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees:
     the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery.

     Erin looks around, realizes she's alone.  As she looks back
     at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab.
     She realizes she's being watched.  The driver's door opens.

     Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys.  She
     jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it
     won't turn over.  Panic.  The Man in the Dark Glasses has
     gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around
     again.  Not a soul.  She tries the engine again.  And again.

     Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages.  Erin peels
     out of the gas station.

     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Erin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus
     on the road.  She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing.

     She reaches the train tracks.  A train is passing.  She has
     to stop.  As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce
     off her rear view mirror.  Truck lights, coming her way.
     Fuck.  She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back
     at the headlights closing in on her.  The train, the
     headlights, the train, the headlights ...

     Finally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last
     train car zips by.  Erin peels out, bounding her rickety car
     over the tracks.  The truck follows.

     EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT

     The Hyundai zips down the road.  And behind it, the truck.

     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT

     She looks out at the landscape around her.  It's black.  No
     other cars on the road.  She starts to panic, accelerates.

     EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT

     The Hyundai going faster.  The truck still following.

     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT

     Erin comes up on a stop sign.  She runs it.  So does the
     truck.   A little later, she makes a turn and sees THE LOST
     CAUSE SALOON.  In the parking lot, like a lifeboat, sits Ed's
     Mercedes.  She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car.

     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT

     Ed is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door.  She
     rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion.

                               ERIN
            Someone's following me.

                               ED
            What?  Who?

                               ERIN
            Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was
            alone, then he followed me, like, two miles.
            Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.

     Ed gets up and heads toward the door.

                               ED
                        (to the counter guy)
            Beer, please.

     As Ed looks out the door, Erin collapses onto a bench.

                               ED
            What kind of truck?

                               ERIN
            I don't know.  Big.  Dark.

                               ED
            He's gone.
                        (back to the table)
            Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?

                               ERIN
            No, Ed -- what with me running for my life,
            I didn't have time to check those things --

                               ED
            I was just asking.  Are you all right?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.

     Ed looks at her.  She looks terrible.  Shaky, tired, drawn.

                               ED
            Jesus, you look like shit.  When was the
            last time you had a decent night's sleep?

     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT

     Crappy and pink.  Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot.
     Erin's Hyundai follows.  Ed stops, gets out.

     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT

     Ed swings by Erin's open car window.

                               ED
            Don't worry.  I'm getting two rooms.

     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT

     Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each
     rattling a key.  They find their adjacent rooms and stop.
     Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand.

                               ED
            Lock the door every which way you can.  And
            if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever
            -- pound on the wall.  I'll come right over.

     She nods a little.  Then before she goes into her room:

                               ERIN
            I think you should know -- there's very few
            people in the world who don't piss me off 90
            percent of the time.
                        (beat)
            You're one of 'em.

     It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it.  They look
     at each other.  Maybe even considering.  But after a long
     beat, she reaches for her door again.  Moment over.

                               ED
            I'm triple locking my door, so don't even
            think of trying to take advantage.

     She smiles, goes inside.  He watches her close her door
     behind her before going inside himself.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT STOOP - NIGHT

     George is sitting alone on the stoop, drinking a beer.  Music
     is coming from his house next door.  He stares out into the
     street with a lot on his mind.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

     Katie and Matt are making a mess of breakfast.  Beth is on
     the floor, grinding cereal into the linoleum.

                             ERIN (O.S.)
            Hello?

     Erin enters, having just gotten home, and sees the mayhem.

                             ERIN
            What are you doing?  Where's George?

                             KATIE
            I don't know.

                             ERIN
            George!

     She heads out.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     George is sitting on the bed when Erin enters.

                             ERIN
            Jesus, George, they're turning the kitchen
            into a hellhole.  You know you can't leave
            them alone like that.

     He doesn't answer.  Doesn't move.  She notices this.

                             ERIN
            What's going on?  What are you doing?

                             GEORGE
            Thinking.

                               ERIN
            About what?

     He's very calm.  He holds out a small jewelry box.

                               GEORGE
            About this.

                               ERIN
            What's that?

                               GEORGE
            It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the
            mall one day, and I thought, damn, those
            would look good on those beautiful earlobes.
            So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next
            time Erin says something nice, does
            something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.
                        (beat)
            Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In
            six months, you haven't said one nice thing
            to me.  That's a long time.

                               ERIN
            I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --

                               GEORGE
            I know.  But still.  Six months.
                        (he stands)
            I think you oughta either find a different
            job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there
            may be men who don't mind being the maid and
            getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as
            shit not one of 'em.

                               ERIN
            I can't leave my job, George.

                               GEORGE
            Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People
            do it all the time.

                               ERIN
            I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best
            thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it.
            For the first time in my life, I got people
            respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a
            room and everyone shuts up just to hear what
            I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever.
            Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.

                               GEORGE
            More than you need me.

                               ERIN
            I need it.

     He nods, then stands, to leave.

                               GEORGE
            Maybe you didn't like who you were before,
            Erin, but I did.  That's who I fell in love
            with.

     Only then does she see the packed duffel bag in the corner.

                               ERIN
            You already packed up your stuff?

                               GEORGE
            I pretty much knew what your answer was
            gonna be.

     He picks it up and walks out the door, tossing the earring
     box on the bed as he goes.

     INT. ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Erin is at her window, looking out at the street below.
     George is strapping a couple of bags onto the back of his
     bike.  He gets on the bike, starts it up, and drives away.

     INT. HYUNDAI - DAY

     Erin is driving, looking weary.  Her kids are in the car.

     Matthew turns on the radio.  Erin reaches over and turns it
     off.  Matthew turns it back on.  Erin glares at him, turns it
     off.  On/off/on/off.  A test of wills.  Finally, when Matthew
     turns it on one more time, Erin turns it off, yanks the knob
     off the stereo and throws it out the window.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY

     The Hyundai pulls into the lot.

     INT. HYUNDAI - DAY

     Erin parks the car, unclips her seat belt.

                               ERIN
            Wait here.

     She gets out.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     Business as usual.  Erin comes in, goes straight to her desk.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY

     Erin flips through her "in" box, looking for something in
     particular.  Doesn't find it.  Grrr.  She heads off to:

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, JANE'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jane is at her desk when Erin comes in.

                               ERIN
            Where's my paycheck?

                               JANE
            Have you been logging on?

                               ERIN
            What?

                               JANE
            I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only
            knows to process paychecks for employees who
            log on in the morning and off at night.

                               ERIN
                        (seething)
            Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not
            in here most mornings and nights?

                               JANE
            You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of
            something.

     Erin glares at her ...

                               ERIN
            I don't believe this --

     ... then turns and storms out of Jane's office.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ed is on the phone when Erin barges in, rage in her eyes.

                               ERIN
            I want my fucking money --

                               ED
                        (into phone)
            I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold
            for just one second here --
                        (puts the call on
                         hold, then, to Erin)
            Do you mind?

                               ERIN
                        (seething)
            Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.

     Clearly, she's in a dander he's going to have to deal with.

                               ED
            Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the
            problem is here, or --

                               ERIN
            It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I
            deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for.
            That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.

                               ED
            Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a
            problem with Jane, work it out for yourself.
            I don't have time to deal with --

                               ERIN
            Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass
            for you.  I watch everything else in my life
            go straight in the toilet, for you.  And
            what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the
            way I'm treated around here -- but have you
            ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever
            mentioned to everyone what good work I'm
            doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey,
            Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has
            the best tits; she gets paid the most cause
            she's the best God damn employee I've ever
            had?

                               ED
            Is that what you want?

                               ERIN
            I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.

     Ed sighs.  Realizes he's going to have to take this on.

                               ED
            I'll see what I can do.

                               ERIN
            You might want to think real hard about the
            amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God
            damn parking lot right now, cause I still
            don't make enough to afford good child care.
            Makes me think about looking around for a
            job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.

     She storms out.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Erin is standing at the sink, visibly exhausted, trying to do
     the dinner dishes with one arm and comfort Beth, who's
     CRYING, with the other.  Matthew comes in.

                               MATTHEW
            Can I play roller hockey?

                               ERIN
            We'll see.

                               MATTHEW
            When?

     The DOORBELL RINGS.  Erin goes to get it.  Matthew follows

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

     Matthew is dogging Erin on this.  Beth is still crying.

                               MATTHEW
            Randy's mom said yes right away.

                               ERIN
                        (snapping)
            Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom
            doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's
            dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's
            gonna take who where is a little easier over
            at Randy's house.

     Erin opens the door.  A MESSENGER is there.

                               MESSENGER
            Erin Brockovich?

                               ERIN
            Yeah?

                               MESSENGER
            Package from Masry & Vititoe.

     He hands her a manila envelope.  She signs for the package,
     then tears into it as the Messenger heads away.

     A CHECK and a SET OF KEYS fall out.  She looks at the check.
     It's made out for $5,000.  A note attached reads "HIRE A
     NANNY. AND LOOK OUTSIDE. - E."

     Erin looks up and sees A BRAND-NEW CHEVY BLAZER parked on the
     curb.  She looks at the keys in her hand.  Chevy keys.  Whoa.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE, PARKING LOT - DAY

     Erin drives up in the Blazer, pulls into a parking space.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, LAW LIBRARY - DAY

     It's dark.  Ed's seated at a table, alone.  Erin walks by the
     door, then spots him and stops in the doorway.

                               ERIN
            Believe it or not, I would've been satisfied
            with just the check.

     Ed turns, sees her.

                               ED
            Well, you go threatening to leave, I can't
            take any chances.  You're the only person
            around who understands what I'm doing.
            Things come up, I gotta know I got someone
            to turn to.

     She sits, reading him.

                               ERIN
            What kind of things come up?

                               ED
            Things like the head counsel for PG&E
            calling me with an offer.
                        (beat)
            20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it
            or leave it.

                               ERIN
            Whoa.  No shit.

                               ED
            It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.

                               ERIN
            So what are you thinking?

                               ED
            I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to
            make this decision.
                        (beat)
            50 thousand bucks is more than any other
            California toxic plaintiff has gotten.
            Ever.  But ...

                               ERIN
            ... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's
            medical bills.

                               ED
            And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.

                               ERIN
            Do you think we'd do better by going to
            trial?

                               ED
            Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have
            anything linking this to PG&E corporate.
            Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus,
            we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to
            bring on more lawyers ...

                               ERIN
            Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot
            of money.

                               ED
            It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight
            million dollars.

     Beat.

                               ERIN
            That's a fucking fortune, Ed.  And you know
            I'm the last person on Earth to walk away
            from a big payday.  But you and me didn't
            get into this to get rich.  We did it cause
            we both have this voice in our heads saying,
            do the right thing; get these plaintiffs
            what they deserve -- the right to live and
            die in some kind of comfort and peace.  If
            50,000 isn't gonna buy that, then we gotta
            say no.
                        (beat)
            Trust me.  If you don't do the right thing
            for these people, getting that 6 million
            dollars is gonna feel like shit.

     He nods to himself, and looks up at her, his mind made up.

                               ED
            I knew I put up with your bullshit for a
            reason.

     INT. ERIN'S NEW CAR - DAY

     It's raining.  They're driving through the tall buildings of
     Century City.  Ed is full of nervous excitement.

                               ED
            This guy, Erin -- he's got more toxic tort
            experience than anyone else in California.
            He's huge.  And he said yes to me on the
            first phone call, right off the bat.
                        (points to a building)
            That's it.  The big one.  They've got the
            top three floors.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, RECEPTION - DAY

     It feels more like the lobby of a five-star hotel than an
     office.  Erin and Ed step off the elevator.  Erin gawks.

                               ERIN
            Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?

                               ED
            Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor
            and behave yourself for once.
                        (to receptionist)
            Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

     As Ed turns to check his reflection, a YOUNG LAWYER comes
     through the reception area.  Erin watches him pass, then,
     still miffed, calls out to him.

                               ERIN
            Scuse me, sir, you got a real nice ass, you
            know that?

     The lawyer double-takes on her, then retreats into the
     office.  Erin turns to Ed, smiles.

                               ERIN
            Oh, I'm sorry.  Was that not what you meant
            by behaving myself?

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD RECEPTION AREA - DAY

     THERESA DELLAVALLE, 38, junior partner, comes out to greet
     them.  She's everything Erin isn't: conservative, restrained,
     unemotional.  And about as sexy as a station wagon.

                               THERESA
            Ed.  Good to see you again.

                               ED
            Theresa, hey -- this is Erin Brockovich.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD HALLWAY - DAY

     Theresa leads Ed and Erin down a long hall of teak desks.
     The sound of their footfalls is swallowed up by the plush
     carpeting.  Occasional ATTORNEYS and PARALEGALS glance at
     Erin.  She feels their stares.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, KURT POTTER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Potter is sitting behind his giant desk when Theresa leads Ed
     and Erin in.

                               THERESA
            Kurt, Ed Masry's here.  And this is Erin
            Brockovich, Ed's assistant.  Erin, this is
            Kurt Potter.

                               POTTER
                        (to Ed, with a wink)
            Well.  Now I know what you meant when you
            called her your secret weapon.

     Erin gives Ed another look.  What the fuck?  Ed gives her a
     firm look back.  Behave.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Potter, Ed, Erin, Theresa and few  PARALEGALS are sitting
     around the table.  As the conversation ping-pongs between Ed
     and Potter, Potter completely ignores Erin.

                               POTTER
            When'd they file the demur?

                               ED
            Yesterday.

                               ERIN
            What's a demur?

                               ED
            It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't
            have a case.  Their lawyers go --

                               POTTER
            How many counts?

                               ED
            Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all
            of 'em.

                               ERIN
            Counts?

                               ED
            Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --

                               POTTER
            Who's the judge?

                               ED
            Corey.

                               POTTER
            Good.

                               ERIN
            Why good?

                               ED
            He's got a reputation for doing all his --

                               POTTER
            How long's he gonna take?

     Erin's starting to steam at Potter.  Theresa sees it brewing,
     tries to intercede.

                               THERESA
            You know what?  Why don't I take Erin down
            the hall, so we can start in on this stuff?

     Erin notices all her files in stacks against the wall.

                               ERIN
            Hey -- those are my files --

                               THERESA
            Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And
            listen, good work.  They're a great start.
            We're just going to have to spend a little
            time filling in the holes in your research.

     Okay, these people are starting to piss her off.

                               ERIN
            Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no
            holes in my research.

                               THERESA
            No offense.  There are just some things we
            need that you probably didn't know to ask.

                               ERIN
            Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I
            may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18
            months on this case, and I know more about
            those plaintiffs than you ever will.

                               THERESA
            Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for
            some of them.

                               ERIN
            Whose number do you need?

                               THERESA
            Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to
            be able to contact the plaintiffs.

                               ERIN
            I said, whose number do you need?

                               THERESA
            You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs'
            numbers by heart.

     Erin just stares at her.  Theresa sighs, reluctantly glances
     down at a file.

                               THERESA
            Annabelle Daniels.

                               ERIN
            Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.

     As Theresa starts to write it down:

                               ERIN
            10 years old, 11 in May.  Lived on the plume
            since birth.  Wanted to be a synchronized
            swimmer, so she spent every minute she could
            in the PG&E pool.  She had a tumor in her
            brain stem detected last November, had an
            operation on Thanksgiving, shrunk it with
            radiation after that.  Her parents are Rita
            and Ted.  Ted's got Chron's disease, and
            Rita has chronic headaches and nausea and
            underwent a hysterectomy last fall.  Ted
            grew up in Hinkley.  His brother Robbie and
            his wife May and their five kids Robbie,
            Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose, and Peter lived on
            the plume too.  Their number's 454-9445.
            You want their diseases?

     Beat.  Erin glares at Theresa, indignant.

                               THERESA
            Okay, look -- I think we got off on the
            wrong foot here --

                               ERIN
            That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet.
            In fucking ugly shoes.

     INT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     It's still raining.  Erin is following Ed to the car.  He's
     furious.

                               ERIN
            She insulted me!

                               ED
            Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But
            instead of handling it politely, instead of
            treating her with respect --

                               ERIN
            Why the fuck should I respect her?

     Ed stops in his tracks, furious.  He glares at her.

                               ED
            Because that's how people treat each other!

                               ERIN
            Not in my world.

                               ED
            Gee, I wonder why.

     On that, he gets in his car, slams the door, and drives off,
     leaving her standing alone in the pouring rain.

                               ERIN
            Hey!  You're my ride!

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - DAY

     Potter and Ed are walking down the hallway, mid-conversation.
     A FEW PARALEGALS follow them with files.

                               POTTER
            I've also been thinking about the team.
            Responsibilities, who should cover what --

                               ED
            Right.

                               POTTER
            I think we should makes some changes.

     EXT. LINWOOD'S DAIRY - DAY

     Bob Linwood is in his barn, mucking it out.  Theresa is at
     the edge of the property, trying unsuccessfully to get his
     attention by yelling and waving her arms.  In her expensive
     shoes, she's stopped short of the cow patty minefield.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE ON A CLIENT FILE as a hand fills in a phone number.

     WIDEN TO SEE Erin seated with a PARALEGAL, rattling off facts
     and numbers from memory.  She's seized by a COUGHING FIT.

     EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY - DAY

     Theresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention.  Finally,
     rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses
     it at the barn.  It hits the window and BREAKS IT.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - DAY

     Erin's desk is empty: no Erin, no files, nothing.  Ed comes
     out of his office and hands Brenda a STACK OF DOCUMENTS.

     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED

     Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up
     again, only this time it says: POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY

     A SECRETARY carries the documents to Potter's office.  On the
     way, she passes THE CONFERENCE ROOM.  Inside, Erin is still
     dictating to the PARALEGAL.  She's shivery with fever now.
     The floor around her is littered with tissues.

     INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY

     Theresa is talking to Rita and Ted Daniels.  Annabelle is
     curled up on the sofa, wrapped up in a blanket.  Rita and Ted
     notice that Theresa doesn't even look at Annabelle.

     INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DAY

     Erin is lying in bed, home sick, talking on the phone.  She's
     talking over the noise of TANIA, her 20-something Eastern
     European nanny, vacuuming the hall.

                               ERIN
            I know she isn't real warm, but they say
            she's a real good lawyer ...

     INTERCUT WITH

     INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY

     Ted Daniels is on the phone.  Rita is next to him.

                               TED
            That may be.  But I don't want her coming to
            the house again.  She's kinda stuck-up, and
            she upsets Annabelle.  Now, I hate to say
            this, but when she left today, Rita asked if
            we should get a new lawyer.

                               ERIN
            Ted, no -- don't do that.  If you don't like
            Theresa, you don't have to work with her.
            Me and Ed are still here for you.

                               TED
            I called Ed two days ago, Erin, and he still
            hasn't called me back.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY

     The phone rings.  Brenda picks up.

                               BRENDA
            Ed Masry's office ... Sorry, he can't be
            interrupted.

     INTERCUT WITH Erin at home, still in bed, so irritated.

                               ERIN
            Don't be a pain in the ass, okay, Brenda?
            Just put him on.

                               BRENDA
                        (with finality)
            I said, he can't be interrupted.

     Erin hangs up.  Then, with a groan, she pulls her weary body
     out of bed.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY

     Erin drags herself into the office.

                               ROSALIND
            Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick
            day.

                               ERIN
            So did I.

     She heads toward Ed's office, but stops when she sees a
     meeting in progress in the conference room.  Ed is on the
     side of the table facing her, flanked by Potter and Theresa.
     On the other side of the table, are FOUR SUITED BACKS.

                               ERIN
            What's going on in there?

                               ROSALIND
            Some meeting.  With PG&E people.

                               ERIN
            PG& -- Are you sure?

                               ROSALIND
            Yup.  They must be important, too, cause
            they came on a special plane.

     Erin feels this like a sock in the gut.  She stares at the
     meeting, stunned.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     This band of PG&E lawyers is the oldest and most impressive
     of all.  Ed, Potter, and Theresa are listening to the most
     senior PG&E lawyer, MR. CORBIN, talk.

                               CORBIN
            ... we would enter into binding arbitration
            -- judge, no jury -- with a settlement to be
            between 50 and 400 million dollars.

     Ed and Potter hear this and think about it.

                               POTTER
            Any preconditions on the settlements?

                               CORBIN
            The plaintiffs have to agree to it
            unanimously.  And they're barred from ever
            discussing their settlement with anyone.

                               ED
            50-400 million dollars isn't a whole hell of
            a lot of money for your company, Mr. Corbin.

                               HEAD COUNSEL
            50-400 million dollars is a great deal of
            money for your plaintiffs, Mr. Masry.

     As Ed mulls this, he sees, beyond Mr. Corbin,

     ERIN

     staring at him from the other side of the glass wall, her
     face cold with hurt and anger.

                               ED
            Could I -- just take a brief break here for
            a moment?  I'll be right back.

     He gets up and goes out into:

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     Ed comes out.  Erin's so angry she can barely breathe.

                               ERIN
            If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your
            fucking head off --

                               ED
            Erin, it's just a meeting.

                               ERIN
            People don't fly down in their own god damn
            plane for "just a meeting" --

                               ED
            Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I
            thought you should rest.

                               ERIN
            Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if
            it suited you.

                               ED
            Okay, look.  It's an important meeting.
            Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --

                               ERIN
            Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think
            anymore?

     He resists being dragged into an knock-down, drag-out fight.

                               ED
            Look, this is serious now.  They're talking
            serious money --

                               ERIN
            And, what, I'm not serious?

                               ED
            You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say
            any God damn thing that comes into your
            head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That
            can be great; that can be a lot of fun --

                               ERIN
            "Fun?"  Jesus, "fun?"  I kill myself for a
            year and a half, hand you the best case of
            your life on a God damn silver platter,
            remind you of why you became a lawyer in the
            first place, and you think of me as "fun?"

                               ED
            Okay, now you're making this personal, and
            it isn't --

                               ERIN
            Not personal?  That's my work in there, Ed.
            My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not
            personal, I don't know what is.

     She starts to COUGH and CRUMBLE, but fights it.

                               ERIN
                        (weakened)
            How dare you take that away from me.

                               ED
            No one's taking anything --

                               ERIN
            Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating
            to some God damn steno clerk so you could
            finish this thing without me.  After all
            I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.

     By now the entire office is watching.  As are the lawyers in
     the conference room.

                               ED
            Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty.
            You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of
            perks ...

                               ERIN
            Perks?  Jesus -- perks?

     Erin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone.

                               ERIN
            If this piece of shit is supposed to take
            the place of your respect, you can take it
            and shove it up your ass.

     She throws it at him and storms away.  The phone hits the
     glass wall of the conference room, CRACKING it.  Ed just
     stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the
     splintered glass wall.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY

     Erin gets to her car.  As she opens the door, the ALARM
     SOUNDS.  She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it
     off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out.  With the
     siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage.

     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Erin's driving home.  As she turns onto her street, her
     headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small
     boy, wearing a backpack, walking the other way.

                               ERIN
            Holy shit --

     She looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark.
     She pulls a U-turn in the middle of the street.  A CAR HONKS.

     Erin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again.  Holy shit,
     is right.  It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night.

                               ERIN
            Matthew --

     She pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk,
     blocking his path.  When he sees her car, he turns and runs
     the other way.  Erin leaps out and follows him.

                               ERIN
            Matthew!  MATTHEW!

     She catches up and collars him.

                               ERIN
            God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you
            doing out here?

                               MATTHEW
            I'm gonna go live with George.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     MUSIC is playing.  TANIA is on the phone.  The receiver is
     yanked from her hand.  She turns to see Erin hovering over
     her, barely containing herself.

                               ERIN
            If you leave here real fast, I might not
            kill you.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATTHEW AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Matthew's in his bed, facing the wall.  Erin sitting on the
     foot of his bed, near tears.  Katie's watching from her bed.

                               ERIN
            We'll work out the roller hockey thing,
            okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out.
            I promise.

                               MATTHEW
            You always say that.  Then you go to work
            and forget you promised.

                               ERIN
            I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard.
            It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to
            be able to organize things right and -- when
            it comes to you guys, I end up falling
            short.

                               MATTHEW
            You never fall short for the work people.  I
            guess maybe you just love them more.

                               ERIN
            Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on
            Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.
                        (beat)
            I promise.

     She lays her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off and
     inches away from her.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Erin comes out of the bedroom.  As she turns to close the
     door, she collapses to the floor in a heap.  Out cold.

     INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

     A busy Southland ER.  George bursts through the doors with
     Katie, Matthew and Beth in tow.  He goes up to the desk.

                               GEORGE
            I'm looking for Erin Brockovich.  They
            brought her in in an ambulance?

     INT. ER WAITING AREA - DAY

     The kids are waiting.  George is talking to a DOCTOR.

                               GEORGE
            Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?

                               DOCTOR
            It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and
            part of the brain.

                               GEORGE
            Jesus.

                               DOCTOR
            She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a
            pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been
            walking around with it for a few weeks now.

                               GEORGE
            How does someone get meningitis?

                               DOCTOR
            Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to
            bacteria or a virus or ...

                               GEORGE
            ... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     Matt and Katie sit on the cheap plastic chairs outside the
     room.  Katie is holding Beth, who's sleeping.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            They can stay at my place till you go home.

     INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     Erin's in bed, hooked up to an IV, looking exhausted.  All
     untouched food tray is beside her bed.  George is standing
     across the room from her, arms crossed tight across his
     chest, keeping his distance.

                               ERIN
            They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just
            wanna keep an eye on me another night.

                               GEORGE
            Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.

     A moment of thick silence.

                               ERIN
            Thank you.

                               GEORGE
                        (giving nothing)
            Mm-hm.

     As she watches him reach for his motorcycle helmet, to leave,
     she's hit with a wave of regret.

                               ERIN
            George, hang on.
                        (he pauses)
            Look ... I'm sorry.  I just --

     There's a KNOCK at the door, and Ed enters.  George looks at
     him.  Not interested in her apologies.

                               GEORGE
            I'll drop 'em by tomorrow.

     And Erin watches George leave the room, then turns to Ed.

                               ERIN
            If you're here to fire me, your timing's
            lousy.

                               ED
            I'm not gonna fire you.
                        (beat)
            I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and
            that woulda made me look like a shit.
                        (serious)
            You embarrassed me, Erin.

                               ERIN
            I know.  I'm sorry.
                        (beat)
            Do I get to hear what happened anyway?

     INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

     Ed has taken off his coat and pulled a chair up next to
     Erin's bed.  He's eating the pudding off her tray.

                               ERIN
            Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?

                               ED
            Uh-huh.

                               ERIN
            And if you had to guess ...

                               ED
            With nothing linking it to the corporate
            offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the
            lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.

                               ERIN
            So why would PG&E offer it?

                               ED
            Because.  They know the evidence; they know
            they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they
            wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once
            you factor in all they'd spend on this case
            in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --

                               ERIN
            Wait, what do you mean, ten years?

                               ED
            Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that
            for the appeal.

                               ERIN
                        (confused)
            I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing
            goes to trial, it'll be ten years before
            these plaintiffs see their money?

                               ED
            Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the
            Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and
            those people still haven't seen a dime.  So
            in legal terms, ten years is --

                               ERIN
            Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human
            beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of
            them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They
            need their money now!
                        (beat)
            We gotta get 'em to agree to the
            arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn
            one of those plaintiffs to --

                               ED
            I know.  We're having a meeting, it's all
            set up --

                               ERIN
            When?  Where?

                               ED
            Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.

                               ERIN
            Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to
            tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --

                               ED
            You're not gonna be there.

                               ERIN
            The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the
            doctor says --

                               ED
            This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm
            saying you can't come.

                               ERIN
            Why not?

                               ED
            Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you.
            He thinks you're a loose cannon.

                               ERIN
            Fuck Kurt.

                               ED
            Erin --

                               ERIN
            No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter
            is?  He's the kind of guy who never would
            have taken this case in the first place.
            He's the kind of guy who would have sold
            these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E
            offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like
            us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head
            telling him to do the right thing.

     But his mind's made up.  He stands to leave.

                               ED
            Don't come, Erin.  I mean it.  If you do,
            I'm gonna have to fire you.
                        (beat)
            Just ... concentrate on getting well.

     EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The parking lot is empty, except for three Mercedes.  Ed,
     Potter, and Theresa are in the doorway, going over their
     notes.  A TRUCK pulls into the lot.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Katie and Matt are watching TV.  Beth is playing near them.
     Behind them, Erin is lying on the couch, under a blanket,
     distractedly trying to watch TV.  She checks her watch.

     EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The lot is filling with more cars and trucks; headlights
     criss-cross each other as people pull in from all directions.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin's sitting up now, jiggling her knee, unable to sit
     still.  She checks her watch again.  6:30.  She can't take
     it.  She throws off the blanket and gets up.

                               ERIN
            Come on, kids, we're going for a ride.

     INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON HANDS.  As people stream in, they are each handed a
     release form with a space for a signature on the bottom.

     INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - LATER

     It's sweltering.  The room, packed with plaintiffs, hums with
     horse flies and tension.  People are fanning themselves with
     the release forms.  Potter's addressing them from a raised
     platform.  Ed, Theresa, and Andrew are seated behind him.

                               POTTER
            Binding arbitration isn't all that different
            from a trial.  It's overseen by a judge.
            Evidence is presented in much the same way.

     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     One more car pulls into the lot.  It's Erin's Chevy.

     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Erin unbuckles her seat belt.

                               ERIN
            Stay in the car, babies, I won't be long.

     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin gets out of the car, looks around, then goes over to a
     window and looks in at the packed meeting.

                               PLAINTIFF (O.S.)
            And then a jury decides?

                               POTTER (O.S.)
            No, sorry, I should have mentioned that.
            There's no jury in binding arbitration.  No
            jury, and no appeal.

     She climbs up on an old wagon for a better view.

                               BOB LINWOOD (O.S.)
            No appeal?  So what are our options if we
            don't like the result?

                               POTTER (O.S.)
            Well -- you have none.  The judge's decision
            is final.  But I really don't anticipate
            that as a problem.

     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Now, in addition to the stifling heat, the large room is
     thick with mistrust.  People are shifting in their seats,
     whispering to each other.

                               TOM BROWN
            You don't even know what it's gonna be; how
            do you know we're gonna like it?

     Agreeing MURMURS ripple through the crowd.

                               POTTER
            As I said before, it will definitely be
            somewhere between 50 and 400 million
            dollars.

                               MANDY BROWN
            Which?  There's a big difference there.

                               POTTER
            I wouldn't want to speculate at this point.

                               MANDY BROWN
            Ed -- what do you think it'll be?

     Potter turns around and looks at Ed seated behind him.

                               ED
            I think ... Kurt's right.  We shouldn't
            speculate.

                               MANDY BROWN
            So then, what, that mystery number's divided
            up at the whim of some judge --

                               POTTER
            Judges don't make decisions based on whim,
            ma'am.  They make them based on precedent
            and evidence.

     The GRUMBLE of discontent has overtaken the room.  More
     whispering, more movement.

     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin watches the meeting fall apart.  It's driving her crazy.

                               ERIN
            Fucking idiot --

     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Potter sees he's losing them, too.  Tries to gain control.

                               POTTER
            Look.  Everyone.  Is this a big decision?
            Absolutely.  But I do believe that if you
            put a little faith in the system, you'll be
            quite pleased with the outcome.

     Ted Daniels gets up from his seat.

                               TED DANIELS
            Mr. Potter, if you knew me from Adam, you'd
            know that being pleased isn't an option for
            me anymore.  Now don't take this personally,
            sir, but I've never seen you before in my
            life.  I'm not about to put my faith in
            anything just cause you tell me to.

     He drops his agreement form, unsigned, then takes Rita's hand
     and heads for the door.

     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Meeting's over.  The plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse.
     Cars start up, headlights flick on.  People pull away.

     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Everyone has left.  Erin enters and looks around.  The floor
     is littered with rejected, unsigned release forms.

     She thinks for a moment, then gets an idea.  She picks up a
     release form, and leaves the firehouse.

     EXT. MINI MALL - NIGHT

     Everything's closed, except the KINKO'S store at the far end.
     Erin's truck pulls into the parking lot.

     INT. KINKO'S - NIGHT

     A BORED EMPLOYEE is at the register, painting with Wite-Out
     on a blue piece of paper.  Erin enters, dragging her kids.

                               ERIN
            Can I have one of those counter thingies,
            please?

     The Employee gives it to her.  Erin crosses to the copiers.
     She slips the release form into one, then taps in the number
     of copies: 635.  Presses "START."  The machine WHIRS to life.

     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT

     Erin's Chevy pulls into the parking lot.

                              MATTHEW (O.S.)
            I don't want to stay here.  It smells.

     INT. HINKLEY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Erin is entering the crappy motel room with her kids.

                               ERIN
            We got no choice.  I'm not gonna make it
            home tonight.  Now go wash up and climb into
            bed.

     As the kids wander toward the bathroom, Erin picks up the
     phone and dials.  RING, RING.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            Hello?

                               ERIN
            Hi.  It's me.
                        (silence)
            I got a favor to ask you.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            I don't do favors for you anymore.

                               ERIN
            It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're
            the only one I trust them with.

     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - DAY

     Very early.  Erin is visible in the motel office, talking to
     the clerk, when George's motorcycle pulls into the lot.  She
     turns around and sees him pulling up next to her Chevy.

     EXT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Erin comes up to him, hands him a key.

                               ERIN
            I got you your own room.

     He takes it, glances toward the motel room.

                               GEORGE
            They up?

                               ERIN
            Hunh-uh.  Not yet.
                        (awkward beat)
            Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike,
            okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.

     She hands him a wad of cash.

                               GEORGE
            How long's this whole thing gonna take?

                               ERIN
            I don't know.  Few days.
                        (beat)
            Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.

     He nods.  She gets into her car.  Before closing the door,
     she turns back to him.

                               ERIN
            And I miss you.

                               GEORGE
            Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.

     She sees how mad she's made him.  Takes a beat.

                               ERIN
            I treated you real bad, George.  I know
            that.  But, my problem was -- I never been
            with anyone who deserved better than that.
            You're the first nice guy who ever liked me.

     George softens, shifts.  He steps toward the truck and gently
     closes her door, so he's standing close to her.

                               ERIN
            I just ... didn't know how to handle it.
            That's all.

     He thinks about this.  Finally:

                               GEORGE
            Think you could learn?

                               ERIN
                        (with a smile)
            You know me.  I pick things up real fast.

     He smiles back at her, nods, then tenderly brushes a piece of
     hair out of her eyes.

                               GEORGE
            You shouldn't be driving around, you know.
            You're sick.

                               ERIN
            Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of
            these folks aren't.

     He nods, understanding.  Then he taps the side of her truck
     and turns toward the motel room.  She puts the truck in gear
     and pulls out.

     EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - DAY

     Erin's Chevy is bombing down the road.

     INT. ERIN'S CAR, BACK SEAT - DAY

     There are two boxes there -- one full of unsigned release
     forms, the other empty.

     EXT. DONNA'S NEW HOUSE - DAY

     Donna's gardening out front, her head wrapped in a scarf to
     cover her chemo-thinning hair, when Erin's Chevy pulls into
     the driveway.  Erin gets out, goes to the back of the truck,
     gets two of the release forms, then heads over to Donna.

     INT. DONNA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Erin is sitting with Pete and Donna.

                               DONNA
            I don't know, Erin -- the way he was talking
            to us, telling us everything was gonna be
            fine -- I just didn't trust him.

                               PETE
            And after all we been through -- no jury, no
            appeal.  It just makes me nervous.

                               ERIN
            I understand all that. And I don't wanna
            force you into anything.  If you don't want
            to sign, that's fine.  But why don't we talk
            it over a little, cause I'd sure hate for
            you to turn this down for the wrong reasons.

     EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY

     The door opens.  Erin emerges, holding two signed agreements.
     Donna is letting her out.

                               ERIN
            You wouldn't happen to have a little time
            right now, would you, Donna?

                               DONNA
            For what?

                               ERIN
            Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns
            now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values
            your opinion ...

     INT. MANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Erin, Donna, Mandy, and Tom are seated on the sofas.  Mandy
     signs an agreement.  Hands the pen to Tom, who also signs.

     EXT. LINWOODS' HOUSE - DAY

     From outside, we see Erin at the kitchen table with Donna and
     Bob and Ruth Linwood, who are listening intently.

     INT. DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY

     Erin and Donna are leaving, saying good-bye to Mary DeSoto.
     Erin has a signed release form in her hand.

     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S CAR - DAY

     DISCO blares.  The two boxes.  The formerly empty one now has
     a small stack of signed release forms in it.  The top one has
     Bob Linwood's signature.

     IN THE FRONT SEAT

     Erin is driving, eating a hamburger, and going over her list
     of plaintiffs.

     EXT. HINKLEY MART - EVENING

     People are going about their shopping.  Rita Daniels is
     stopped, talking with A FEW MORE PLAINTIFFS.

                               RITA
            I thought so, too, but Erin says a trial's
            gonna take years

     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT

     The signed stack has grown; the unsigned stack has shrunk.
     Erin drops five more agreements into the "signed" box.

     INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     In the wee hours.  While her kids sleep, Erin sits at the
     cheap motel room table, going through her forms, organizing,
     alphabetizing.

     INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE ON ERIN, fast asleep at the table, her face pressed
     against the linoleum.  There's some NOISE in the room,
     WHISPERING.  Erin stirs and looks around to see George behind
     her, diapering Beth, while Matt and Katie put their shoes on.

                               ERIN
            What time is it?

                               GEORGE
            Real early.  We're just gonna take your car
            to get some breakfast.

     Erin forces herself awake.

                               ERIN
            No, I need my car --

                               GEORGE
            We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more
            sleep.

     He picks up Beth, takes Katie's hand, and calls across the
     room to Matthew.

                               GEORGE
            C'mon, pal.  Leave that alone, we gotta go.

     Erin turns to see Matthew holding one of her release forms.

                               ERIN
            Oh, baby, please don't play with that, okay?
            I got 'em all organized.  Just put it back.

     But he's reading it.  And something has caught his attention.
     He looks up at Erin.

                               MATTHEW
            This girl's the same age as me.

     Erin gently takes the form away from Matthew, wanting to
     shield him from the harsh realities of this case.

                               ERIN
            That's right, sweetheart.

     She replaces the form on top of the stack.

                               MATTHEW
            She's one of the sick people?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  She is.
                        (beat)
            But you know what?  That's why I'm helping
            her.  So she can get some medicine to make
            her feel better.

     Matthew mulls this over a bit more.

                               MATTHEW
            How come her own mom isn't helping her?

                               ERIN
            Cause her own mom's real sick, too.

     Matthew thinks real hard about this, then heads over to the
     door, where George, Beth, and Katie are waiting for him.
     Before he leaves, though, he turns back to Erin.

                               MATTHEW
            Maybe we'll bring you back some breakfast.
            You want eggs?

     She looks at the group of them, feels their shift toward
     acceptance.  Smiles, moved.

                               ERIN
            Eggs'd be great, baby.  Eggs'd be perfect.

     INT. ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

     Erin's driving along a dusty Hinkley road, eating cold eggs
     out of a take-out container with her fingers.

     EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY

     Morning.  A GROUP OF MEN are arriving at work.  Erin's truck
     pulls up.  She grabs some release forms from the truck and
     wanders up to the men.

                               ERIN
            Hey, y'all.  How you all doing today?

     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

     She tosses eight more agreements in the signed stack.

     EXT. HINKLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

     Morning drop-off time.  Erin is handing out release forms zo
     a GROUP of MOTHERS who just dropped off their kids.

     EXT. HINKLEY MART - NIGHT

     Erin is leaning on the hood of her truck, going down her list
     of plaintiffs, checking off the ones who have already signed.

     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - DAY

     Another day.  Erin has set up shop here and is at a table
     with about FIVE PLAINTIFFS, all reading agreements.  MIKE
     AMBROSINO enters.  Erin spots him.

                               ERIN
            Mike!  I been looking all over for you.
            Come here, I wanna talk to you.

     INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT

     The signed stack is getting bigger.

     INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

     And bigger.

     INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

     And still bigger.

     EXT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON ERIN'S TRUNK.  A bunch more forms get thrown onto
     the signed stack, which is now much higher than the unsigned.

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            I'm gonna head out to Barstow and talk to
            some folks out there tonight.

     WIDEN TO REVEAL Erin talking on a nearby pay phone.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.

                               ERIN
            I will.  Bye.

     She hangs up.  As she turns to get into her car, she finds
     herself face-to-face with the Man in the Dark Glasses.

                               ERIN
            Jesus!

     He's just standing there, a foot away, blocking her exit.
     She recognizes his truck as the one that chased her.

                               ERIN
            Okay, what're you gonna do?  You gonna kill
            me?  Dump my body in a ditch somewhere?  Or
            maybe you just wanna inject me with some
            poison too -- why change tactics at this
            stage of the game?
                        (beat)
            Get outta my way, you make me sick.

     She pushes past him.  But he grabs her by the arm.  He's a
     big guy; it's a strong grab.  Now she's scared.  For a
     moment, he does nothing.  Just looks at her.  Then:

                               DARK GLASSES
            If PG&E made someone destroy a whole lot of
            documents -- would that matter to you?

     Erin takes a beat, realizing she completely misread him.  She
     gently pulls her arm away.

                               ERIN
            Well ... I guess that depends on what the
            documents were.
                        (she takes a beat)
            I'm sorry -- I didn't get your name.

                               DARK GLASSES
            Embry.  Charles Embry.

     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT

     Erin and Embry are the only patrons.  Erin's eating a burger.
     Embry has a beer.  He's talking quietly, not looking at her.

                               EMBRY
            I was working in the compressor, and out of
            nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the
            office and says, we're gonna give you a
            shredder machine, and send you on down to
            the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of
            all the documents stored out there.

                               ERIN
            Did he say why?

                               EMBRY
            Nope.  And I didn't ask.

                               ERIN
            Did you get a look at the stuff you
            destroyed?

                               EMBRY
            Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding --
            you gotta find some way to entertain your
            mind.  So yeah, I took a look.

                               ERIN
            And ...?

                               EMBRY
            There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation
            schedules, the like.
                        (beat)
            But then there were a few memos about the
            holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had
            readings from test wells, stuff like that.

     Erin tries to hide her excitement at this information.

                               ERIN
            And you were told to destroy those?

                               EMBRY
            That's right.

     Destruction of evidence.  Pretty big deal.  Erin plays it
     down.  Wipes her mouth with her napkin, takes a sip of beer.

                               EMBRY
            Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good
            employee.

                               ERIN
            What do you mean?

                               EMBRY
            Well.  There were a few documents that I
            somehow didn't get around to shredding.
                        (beat)
            That I kept instead.

     Erin stops, mid-bite.

     INT. EMBRY'S GARAGE - NIGHT

     He's dug out an inch-high stack of documents.  Erin looks
     them over, stunned.  Embry is standing apart from her, hands
     shoved deep in his pockets.

                               ERIN
            How come you didn't say anything when you
            found these things?

                               EMBRY
            At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some
            of 'em want to go to college.  I can't
            afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was
            being honorable.
                        (beat)
            But there's nothing honorable in what I did.
                        (beat)
            Maybe that's why they picked me for the job.
            Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

     Rosalind is at the desk.  Anna, Brenda, and Jane are helping
     themselves to coffee.  Erin enters, with a big box in her
     arms and a whole lot of attitude.

                               ERIN
            Hey, Ros, where are they?

                               ROSALIND
            In the conference --

     But Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can
     finish.  Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her
     gait.  They watch her with interest.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     The table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated
     slew of paper that PG&E is sending them.  Ed, Kurt, Theresa,
     Andrew and ABOUT FIVE PARALEGALS are sifting through them.

     Erin breezes in like sunshine.

                               ERIN
            Morning!

                               ED
            Erin?  What are you --

                               ERIN
                        (ignoring Ed)
            You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely
            forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing
            as how you've been so good to me, I think
            that is a terrible oversight.  So what I
            been doing over the last few days is I've
            been putting together a present for you.

     She plunks the box down on the table.  Potter opens the top
     of the box.  Looks in.

                               ERIN
            635.  They all signed.  Every single one.

     IN THE DOORWAY, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering
     what's up.  A huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads
     across Ed's face.

                               ED
            Ho - ly - shit.

                               ERIN
            Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a
            little something for you, too.

     Erin hands Ed a manila envelope.  He opens it.

                               ERIN
            Internal PG&E documents, all about the
            contamination.  The one I like best says,
            and I'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes,
            the water's poisonous, but it'd be better
            for all involved if this matter wasn't
            discussed with the neighbors.  It's to the
            Hinkley station, from PG&E Headquarters.
            Stamped received, March, 1966.

     Potter and Theresa reel.  Ed shakes his head in disbelief.

                               POTTER
            Where did -- how did you do this?

                               ERIN
            Well, what with me not having any brains or
            legal expertise, I just went on up there and
            performed sexual favors.  635 blow jobs in
            five days.  Whew, am I ever tired.

     And she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed.
     The CLIP CLIP CLIP of her heels carry her away.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

     Erin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads
     down the hall.  She presses the elevator button.  The doors
     open.  As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office.

                               ED
            Hey!

     Erin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing.  He
     stares at her, in awe.

                               ED
            I don't know what to say.

                               ERIN
            Say you were wrong.

                               ED
            I was wrong.

                               ERIN
            Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged
            yourself.

                               ED
            I did.  Both.

                               ERIN
            Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on
            Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.

                               ED
            The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe,
            Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in
            history.

     He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in
     the elevator.  He walks toward her, stops right outside the
     elevator.

                               ED
            But I know you're not gonna quit on me.

                               ERIN
            How do you know that?

                               ED
                        (with a smile)
            Cause you got a little voice in your head
            saying, do the right thing.  Give him
            another chance.

     Of course she will.  She releases her hand so he won't see
     her smiling.  Ed watches the doors close.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. PCH - DAY

     One of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball.

     Erin's Chevy moves up the PCH.  DISCO music emanates from it.

     INT. ERIN'S CHEVY - DAY

     Erin's at the wheel.  Time has passed -- her hair's a little
     different.  She's singing along with "Funky Town."

     EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - DAY

     Erin gets out of her new truck, looks, sees the Irvings in a
     little cluster.  Donna's under an umbrella.  Pete is
     slathering on sunscreen.  The two girls zip out toward the
     water.  Erin waves.  Pete and Donna spot her, wave back.

     EXT. BEACH - LATER

     Donna is standing at the edge of the water, watching her
     girls boogie board in.  Erin comes up behind her.

                               ERIN
            How you feeling today?

     Donna turns, sees her.  Smiles.

                               DONNA
            It's a good day.  I feel good.

                               ERIN
            Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it,
            maybe we should talk shop.

     Erin sits down on a rock.

                               ERIN
            The judge came up with a number.

                               DONNA
            A number for the whole group, or for us?

                               ERIN
            Both.

     Donna sits down next to her.

                               ERIN
            He's making them pay the maximum.

     Tears of vindication spring to Donna's eyes.

                               DONNA
            Oh, my God.

                               ERIN
            And he's making them give five million of it
            to you all.

                               DONNA
            Five million dollars?

                               ERIN
            Five million dollars.

     She reels.  After a breathless beat:

                               DONNA
            I don't even know how much money that is.

                               ERIN
            It's enough -- for whatever you need, for
            whatever your girls need, for whatever your
            girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.

     Donna wipes the tears off her face, then watches the light
     flickering off her girls playing in the surf.

                               DONNA
            I can put them in a good school.

                               ERIN
            Any school you want.

                               DONNA
            And get someone to help around the house.

                               ERIN
            Yup.

                               DONNA
            Oh my God.  Oh my God.

     Donna is overwhelmed.  Erin pulls her close.

                               DONNA
            Oh, my God.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

     Now this is where the hot lawyers work.  A gleaming testament
     to power.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

     Boxes everywhere.  They just moved in.  Everyone is unpacking
     at his or her desk.  Rosalind is manning the new phones.

                               ROSALIND
            Masry & Vititoe, can I -- shoot!

     She lost them.  Her reaction indicates this isn't the first
     time.  The front doors open and Erin enters.

                               ERIN
            Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?

                               ROSALIND
            Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.
                        (into phone)
            Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.
                        (calling out)
            Does anyone know anything about these
            phones?

     Erin heads on down a hall to:

     INT. ED'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

     A beautiful corner office.  Ed is unpacking when Erin enters.

                               ERIN
            Careful you don't spit from here; you could
            kill someone.

                               ED
            You see your office?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  Yours is nicer.

                               ED
            Oh, okay.  Here it comes.

                               ERIN
            Here what comes?

                               ED
            The extortion, the threats ...

                               ERIN
            I wasn't gonna --

                               ED
            "I can always find someplace else to work.
            Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give
            me a view of the French Riviera ..."

                               ERIN
            Ed, I swear, I'm not --

                               ED
            Okay, fine.  Fine  You backed me into a
            corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...

     He reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a check.  Hands
     it to her.

                               ERIN
            What is that?

                               ED
            Take it.

     Erin does.  Looks at it.  Her eyes bug out.

                               ERIN
            Two million dollars?

                               ED
            The firm took in sixty.  That's three
            percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.

     She stares at it, speechless.  He goes back to unpacking

                               ED
            Oh, now I suppose you're gonna say it's not
            enough.  Well, tough, Erin.  Too goddamn
            bad.  Cause this is absolutely, positively
            where I draw the line.

                                                  FADE OUT.

                               THE END
ERIN BROCKOVICH
                           A True Story

                                by

                          Susannah Grant





                                                  February 1, 1998






     EXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY

     Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars
     motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls
     of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms.

     ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk,
     past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops,
     Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of
     this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE-
     HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to look
     at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see
     they're leaving a 99-cent store.

     As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are
     connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS.
     Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going.

     They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The men
     pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful
     woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes
     rest on her a microsecond longer than usual.

     - Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the
     tops of her thighs.

     - A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a
     MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR.

     - A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the
     TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER.

     It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block
     that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is
     so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All
     those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have
     obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH.

     EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

     A side street.  No pedestrians, just parked cars.  A PARKING
     TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai.

                               ERIN
            Fuck.

     Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to
     her voice.  Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze.

     As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses
     accidentally CLATTER to the ground.

                               ERIN
            Shit.

     When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement.

                               ERIN
            God damn it.

     She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.

     WIDER ON THE STREET

     The Hyundai starts it up, signals.  Then, just as it pulls
     slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the
     corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side
     of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.  It
     SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.  And stops.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY

     A boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded
     by strip malls.  Definitely not where the power lawyers work.

                               ROSALIND (O.S.)
            Morning, Mr. Masry.  How you doing today?

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY

     Generic.  Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art.  A sign over
     the reception desk reads: MASRY & VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW.

     ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper
     receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand.  He's in his
     mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM --
     already rumpled.

                               ED
            Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind.

     Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that
     is his career has long since dissipated.  He trundles off
     toward his office.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ed's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what
     can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner.
     She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed.

                               BRENDA
            Tony Marvin.

                               ED
            Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain
            and suffering this time?

                               BRENDA
            His dry cleaners.  You want him?

                               ED
            What do you think?  What's this?

     He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card.

                               BRENDA
            Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.

                               ED
            Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.

                               BRENDA
            He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's
            your nine o'clock in there.

     Ed peers into his office.  It's a mess -- papers everywhere,
     unopened mail.  Standing in the middle of the room is Erin,
     in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress.  As she jiggles a
     spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously.
     Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace.

                               ED
            Whoa.
                        (to Brenda)
            Remind me.

                               BRENDA
            Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her
            fault, she says.
                        (sarcastic)
            And she looks like such an honest girl, don't
            you think?

                               ED
            You shouldn't judge, Brenda.

                               BRENDA
            Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.

     As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone.

                               BRENDA
            I can't find him, Tony.  We'll have to call
            you back.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Not an office that exudes authority, and Ed's blustery
     entrance only adds to the sense of chaos.

                               ED
            Erin -- hi.  Sorry you had to wait.  Here,
            sit down, sit down.

     He clears a stack of papers off a chair.

                               ERIN
            Thanks a lot.
                        (as she sits)
            I tell you, I never thought just standing
            would take it out of me, but ever since that
            shithead hit me, it feels like my whole
            body's put together wrong.

     Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy.

                               ED
            Jesus, you poor thing.
                        (he sits)
            Well, listen, you came to the right place.
            Whoever did this to you made one hell of a
            mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make
            him pay for it.

     He takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write.

                               ED
            Why don't you tell me what happened?

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAY

     Erin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she
     owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to
     Ed, who's questioning her.

                               ERIN
            I was pulling out real slow, and out of
            nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the
            corner like a bat outta hell ...

     She glances at the defendant's table, where a DOCTOR sits
     nobly in surgical scrubs.  His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS
     are behind him.  A frigging Norman Rockwell painting.

     LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:

                               ERIN
            They took some bone from my hip and put it
            in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm
            about seventeen thousand in debt right now.

     STILL LATER:

                               ERIN
            ... couldn't take painkillers cause they
            made me too groggy to take care of my kids.

     STILL LATER:

                               ERIN
            ... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's
            just nine months.

     STILL LATER:

                               ERIN
            ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person,
            a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care
            of my kids.  You know?

                               ED
                        (oh so moved)
            Yeah.  I know.

     INT. COURTROOM - LATER

     Erin is still on the stand.  But now the doctor's lawyer is
     questioning her.

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
            Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your
            ex-husband helping out?

                               ERIN
            Which one?

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
                        (feigning shock)
            There's more than one?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  There's two.  Why?

     Erin looks over at the jury.  The personification of
     conservative family values.  Oh, shit.

     LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:

                               ERIN
                        (getting defensive)
            ... not like a career, cause I had my babies.
            But I woulda worked, for sure, if I didn't
            have this neck thing.

     Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem.
     Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch.

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
                        (sarcastic)
            Right.  No doubt.

     Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances.  Great.

     STILL LATER:

     The defendant's lawyers is on the offensive.  Erin's starting
     to feel the case slipping away.

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
            So.  You must've been feeling pretty
            desperate that afternoon.

                               ERIN
                        (pointed)
            What's your point?

     Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad.

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
            Broke, three kids, no job.  A doctor in a
            Jaguar must've looked like a pretty good
            meal ticket.

     Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement.
     She's on a sinking ship.

                               ERIN
            What?  Hey -- he hit me.

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
            So you say.

                               ERIN
            He came tearing around the corner, out of
            control --

                               DEFENDING LAWYER
            An ER doctor who spends his days saving
            lives was the one out of control --

                               ERIN
                        (erupting)
            That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!

     INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

     The door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out,
     furious.  Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator.

                               ERIN
            Open and shut?  Open and fucking shut?

                               ED
            If you hadn't used profanity --

                               ERIN
            Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God
            damn, he made me look like some cheap --

                               ED
            I told you the questions might get a little
            personal --

                               ERIN
            Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a
            million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.

     Ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention.

                               ED
            Okay -- let's try and settle down here.

                               ERIN
            Settle down?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr.
            Masry!  I can't afford to settle down!

     Beat.

                               ED
            I'm sorry, Erin.

                               ERIN
            Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my
            kids.

     Erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

     A shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge.  The
     Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb.

     Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads
     over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell.

     A Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white
     baby.  This is MRS. MORALES.

                               MRS. MORALES
            Hi, Erin!  You're back so soon.  How was it?

     She hands Erin the baby.  It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old.
     Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.

                               ERIN
            Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where
            are Matt and Katie?

                               MRS. MORALES
            Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?

     The truth is too depressing to share.

                               ERIN
            It'll be fine, yeah.

                               MRS. MORALES
            Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell
            you before, with your worries --

                               ERIN
            What?

                               MRS. MORALES
            My daughter, she's bought a big house with a
            room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.

                               ERIN
            You're moving away?  When?

                               MRS. MORALES
            Next week.

                               ERIN
                        (stunned)
            Wow, that's soon --

                               MRS. MORALES
            I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can
            help my daughter take care of my grandkids.
            And it's good for you, too.  Now you have
            money, you can find a good babysitter, huh?
            Not the old lady next door.

     Oh, God.  In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

     Erin carries Beth up to her house.  As she nears her door,
     she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG.  It crunches under her sole.

                               ERIN
            Ugh.

     Insult added to injury.  She heads up to the house, dragging
     her shoe, wiping off the bug guts.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN LIVING/DINING SPACE - DAY

     Just as dull inside.  Salvation Army furniture.  A lot of
     beige.  Erin's two older kids, MATTHEW (7) and KATIE (5) are
     at the table.  Beth is in a baby seat.  Erin spoons some Mac
     & Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry.

                               MATTHEW
            I don't like this part, it's all crusty.

                               KATIE
            I like the crust.

     Erin switches the plates.

                               ERIN
            Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.

                               KATIE
            How come you're not eating?

     Cause there isn't enough food.

                               ERIN
            Mamma's gonna eat later.

     From her baby seat on the table, Beth COUGHS some more.
     Thick, sick-sounding coughs.  Erin looks at her.

                               ERIN
            Don't go getting sick on me, baby.  Okay?

     INT. ERIN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     The shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with
     STEAM.  Erin is seated with COUGHING, CRYING Beth on her lap,
     trying to steam the illness out of her.

                               ERIN
            It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.  I promise.

     But her face doesn't look like she believes it.

     EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

     Matt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine.

     INT. DRUGSTORE, AISLE - DAY

     Erin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles.  She stops at the
     medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself,
     glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle.

     INT. DRUGSTORE, AT THE REGISTER - DAY

     As a CUSTOMER steps away from the register, Erin steps up
     with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the CHECK-OUT LADY.

                               ERIN
            Hi, remember me?  I was in yesterday.  Bought
            a whole mess of stuff?  Round about five?

                               CHECK-OUT LADY
            Honey, it's a zoo here at five.  I'm lucky
            if I even see a face, much less remember it.

                               ERIN
            Oh, shoot, yeah, I guess that'd be tough.
            Well, listen, I meant to buy my baby here
            some medicine, and by the time I got home, I
            realized I'd bought the adult stuff by
            mistake.  And now, wouldn't you know, I
            can't find the receipt.  I was wondering --
            could I maybe exchange it anyway ...

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

     Erin feeds Beth her medicine, feeling miserable about it.

                               ERIN
            Just remember.  No matter what your Mamma
            does, lying and stealing is real bad.  I
            don't ever wanna hear you doing something
            like that ...

     On the table beside her sit the classifieds.  Row after row
     of want ads circled, then X-'d out in red.  A WATER BUG
     crawls across the edge of the paper.

                               ERIN
            ... Cause there's no excuse for it, you hear
            me?  No excuse at all.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Midday.  Ed enters with a cup of coffee in his hand.  As he
     heads to his desk, he trips on a box of files.  Coffee
     sloshes out of his cup, onto his shirt.

                               ED
            Damn it!
                        (calling out)
            Brenda!

     She pops her head in.

                               BRENDA
            Yeah?

     He grabs a tissue, swabs his shirt, then kicks at the box.

                               ED
            What the hell is this doing here?

                               BRENDA
            It's those files you asked for.

                               ED
            I didn't mean for you to leave them in the
            middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me.
            What do I have this afternoon?

                               BRENDA
            Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.

     As Ed checks his reflection in the glass wall of his office,
     he notices, on the other side:

     ERIN, standing in the middle of the secretaries' area, in a
     miniskirt and leather bustier, talking to MARIO, the firm's
     mentally challenged office boy.  Mario heads away from her.

                               ED
            What's she doing here?

                               BRENDA
            Who?

     Ed goes to his office door and waves Mario over.

                               ED
            Hey -- Mario -- what's she doing here?

                               MARIO
            She works here.

     Ed looks back at her -- what the hell?

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     The support staff -- mostly middle-aged women -- are all
     stealing glances at Erin.  Ed comes up to her, all friendly.

                               ED
            Erin!  How's it going?

     Up close, the wear and tear of worry show on her face.

                               ERIN
            You never called me back.  I left messages.

                               ED
            You did?  Wow, sorry about that.
                        (beat)
            Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He
            seems to think that you said --

                               ERIN
            There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry.
            Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did
            both.

     Glances skitter between the secretaries -- get a load of
     this.  Ed lowers his voice.

                               ED
            I never lied.  I may have miscalculated --
            that happens sometimes, but --

                               ERIN
            You said things would be fine, and they're
            not.

                               ED
            I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --

                               ERIN
            I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And
            I've looked, but when you've spent the last
            six years raising babies, it's real hard to
            convince someone to give you a job that pays
            worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the
            one who said I was gonna be okay, you should
            be the one to hire me.

     Ed sees everyone watching him, listening.

                               ED
            I'd love to help, Erin, but I'm sorry, I
            have a full staff right now, so --

     He starts to escort her out, but she stays put.

                               ERIN
            Bullshit.  If you had a full staff, you'd
            have time to return your damn phone calls.

     She's backing him into a corner here.  He shifts gears.

                               ED
            Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for
            a job here, you can do it the way everyone
            else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --

                               ERIN
            I'm not everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm
            someone you made promises to that you didn't
            deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids'
            well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard-
            working, and I'll do anything.  But if you
            think I'm leaving here without a job, you
            got another thing coming.

     Ed glances around the room.  Not a whole lot of options here.
     He looks back at Erin.

                               ED
            No benefits.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY

     A tight office lined with file cabinets and shelves.  ANNA,
     the humorless file clerk, is showing Erin around.

                               ANNA
            ... what we do in here is keep track of all
            the case files.  That way, at any time, we
            can find out a case's status -- where it is
            in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em
            all here, alphabetically --

                               ERIN
            Oh, hell.
                        (beat)
            I'm dyslexic.

                               ANNA
            That's a joke, right?

     Erin shakes her head, no.  Great, thinks Anna.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     As Anna shows Erin around the office, they pass JANE, the
     bitter office manager, and Brenda, at the coffee area.

                               JANE
            Just last week, he told my sister we weren't
            hiring.

                               BRENDA
            What's your sister look like?

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Ed is packing up his office.  Erin sticks her head in.

                               ERIN
            Mr. Masry?

     He turns, sees her.

                               ED
            Yeah?

                               ERIN
            I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd
            talk to about maybe getting an advance on my
            paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.

                               ED
            Jane's the office manager.  She handles
            payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early
            on Fridays.

                               ERIN
            Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.

     Ed looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay.

                               ED
            Oh, for Christ's sake ...

     He takes out his wallet, looks in.

                               ED
            All I have is hundreds.

                               ERIN
            I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.

                               ED
            Bullshit, you don't.

     He slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves.  When he's gone,
     she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a
     great big kiss.

     EXT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a
     shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's.  Katie and Matt
     pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house.

     EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

     Erin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag
     of groceries in the other.  Katie and Matt are each carrying
     a bag of groceries as well.  They are all singing and moving
     with the jaunty step of the newly carefree.  Katie spots a
     flower display outside the store.

                               KATIE
            Mommy, can I get a flower?

                               ERIN
            Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     A small room with Salvation Army furniture.  A BUNCH OF
     DAISIES is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table.
     Matt and Katie are asleep in bed.  Erin looks down at them,
     smiles, then kisses them good-night.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Erin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door.
     But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled
     with the DEAFENING ROAR of a MOTORCYCLE, REVVING and REVVING.
     It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what
     used to be Mrs. Morales's house.  A few MOTORCYCLES are
     parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the
     stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE.

                               ERIN
            Hey!

     But of course he can't hear her.  She walks over to him,
     stands right in his line of vision.

                               ERIN
            HEY!

     He sees her and kills the engine.  Everything about GEORGE
     HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long
     hair.  Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's.

                               GEORGE
            Well, hello to you, darlin'.

                               ERIN
            What the hell do you think you're doing,
            making all that Goddamn noise?

                               GEORGE
            Just introducing myself to the neighbors.

                               ERIN
            Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're
            introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.

     The guys on the porch chuckle.  Erin turns and starts back to
     her house.  George hops off his bike and follows her.

                               GEORGE
            Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a
            beautiful woman next door, I'da done this
            different.  Let's start over.  My name's
            George.  What's yours?

                               ERIN
            Just think of me as the person next door who
            likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.

                               GEORGE
            Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what.
            How about if I take you out on a date to
            apologize for my rudeness?

     Erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking.

                               GEORGE
            Come on.  Gimme your number, I'll call you
            up proper and ask you out and everything.

     She stops at her porch, turns to him.

                               ERIN
            You want my number?

                               GEORGE
            I do.

                               ERIN
            Which number do you want, George?

                               GEORGE
            You got more than one?

                               ERIN
            Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of
            my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.

                               GEORGE
            Ten?

                               ERIN
            Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how
            many months old my little girl is.

                               GEORGE
            You got a little girl?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five.
            That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven
            is my son's age.  Two is how many times I
            been married and divorced.  You getting all
            this?  16 is the number of dollars in my
            bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number.
            And with all the other numbers I gave you,
            I'm guessing zero is the number of times
            you're gonna call it.

     She turns and heads inside.  He calls out after her:

                               GEORGE
            How the hell do you know your bank balance
            right off the top of your head like that?
            See, that impresses me.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

     Morning.  Erin walks in, wearing her usual garb.  She passes
     the coffee area, where Jane, Brenda, and Anna are milling.
     Brenda sees her, gives Anna a nudge.  They both check out her
     short hem.  Anna nudges Jane, who looks as well.  Erin
     glances over just in time to see all three of them staring at
     her judgementally.  She stops in her tracks and stares back.

                               ERIN
            Y'all got something you wanna discuss?

     The women go back to stirring their coffees.  Erin walks on.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ed is walking into his office with a coffee cup in his hand
     when he trips over the same box of files again.

                               ED
            Damn it!
                        (calling out)
            Brenda!
                        (no answer)
            BRENDA!

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY

     Erin is alone, filing as she talks on the phone.

                               ERIN
            How long's she been crying like that? ...
            Well, she's got that tooth coming in --

     Ed appears in the door, carrying the box of files.

                               ERIN
            Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --
                        (sees Ed)
            I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that
            bag -- I'll check back in a bit.
                        (hangs up)
            Sorry.  My kid --

                               ED
            Where's Anna?

                               ERIN
            Out to lunch with the girls.

                               ED
            Oh.  Huh.
                        (beat)
            Well, look, I got this file I need valued.
            Real estate thing.  A lady has some property
            next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy.
            I need to know what to ask for it.

     He plunks the box of files on her desk.  She stares at it,
     with no idea of how to go about that.

                               ERIN
            Oh.  Okay.

     He sees her staring at the box.

                               ED
            You do know how to do that, don't you?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.

                               ED
            Good.

     Ed heads out, but pauses before leaving.

                               ED
            You're a girl.

                               ERIN
            Excuse me?

                               ED
            How come you're not at lunch with the girls?
            You're a girl.

                               ERIN
            I guess I'm not the right kind.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - NIGHT

     Erin is at her desk, staring bewildered at the files from the
     box Ed gave her, which are now spread across her desktop.
     She sees Anna packing up her things, to leave.

                               ERIN
            Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff -
            - could you remind me, cause I'm a little
            confused about how exactly we do that.

                               ANNA
                        (exasperated)
            Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you
            don't know how to do your job by now, I am
            not about to do it for you.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Katie and Matt are running up to the house.  Erin follows,
     toting Beth under one arm and the box of documents under the
     other.  She steps on another water bug.

                               ERIN
            Ugh.

     As she wipes the bug guts off the bottom of her shoe:

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            Hey, neighbor, wanna beer?

     She spots George on his stoop, with a six-pack beside him.

                               ERIN
            No.

                               GEORGE
            C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for
            that night.

                               ERIN
            Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money
            back.

     He gets up and follows her to her house.

                               GEORGE
            Now, why're you giving me such a hard time?
            I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.

     Erin turns to him.  The kids are waiting at the door.

                               ERIN
            I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60
            and Mexican and she watched my kids for
            free.  Something tells me you're not gonna
            be able to measure up to that.

                               GEORGE
            You need help with your kids?  I could
            probably do that.

     George reaches out and grabs the box from under her arm.

                               ERIN
            I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.

                               GEORGE
            Why not?

                               ERIN
            Cause I don't even know you.

                               GEORGE
            Yeah, and whose fault is that?

     He's got a point there.  After a beat:

                               GEORGE
            What, you got so many friends in this world,
            you don't have use for one more?

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     George is on the floor with Matt and Katie, playing War.
     Katie points to the Harley emblem on his leather jacket.

                               KATIE
            What's that stand for?

                               GEORGE
            That's for Harley Davidson.  The best damn
            motorcycle ever made.

     Erin comes in from the kitchen.

                               ERIN
            And if I catch either of you anywhere near
            one, I'll knock you silly.  Go on to bed,
            now -- I'll come tuck you in in a minute.

     They get up ...

                               GEORGE
            Night.

                               KATIE/MATT
            Night.

     ... and head into bed.  George starts cleaning up the cards.

                               GEORGE
            Great kids.

     Erin bends down to help him.

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.

                               GEORGE
            How?

                               ERIN
            I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this
            weird sitter all afternoon who costs a
            fortune and smells like chicken fat.

                               GEORGE
            I was serious before, you know.  If you need
            someone to keep an eye on them -- after
            school or something -- I don't have a job
            now, so I'm around in the afternoons.

                               ERIN
            Great.  Another deadbeat.

                               GEORGE
            I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.

                               ERIN
            Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the
            time, live off your trust fund?

                               GEORGE
            I do construction, which pays real good.
            And I make it last by living cheap.

                               ERIN
                        (with a little laugh)
            I hope that's not supposed to impress me.

                               GEORGE
            Are you this hard on everyone who tries to
            help you?

                               ERIN
            It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of
            practice.

                               GEORGE
            Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is
            to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer,
            I don't mind taking you up on it.

                               ERIN
            Why in the hell would you want to watch my
            kids?

                               GEORGE
            Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with
            them.

                               ERIN
            Right.

     She starts cleaning up the cards.

                               GEORGE
            I do.  I like how they keep it all simple,
            you know?  They don't get all complicated
            about life, like grown-ups do.  A bicycle
            and an ice cream cone -- boom, done, they're
            happy.

     Erin thinks about the offer.

                               ERIN
            You're around every afternoon?

                               GEORGE
            Yup.  Usually working on my bike.
                        (she's tempted)
            No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you
            can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.

     Tempting.  Erin looks him over.

                               ERIN
            This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.

                               GEORGE
                        (with a laugh)
            Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The wee hours.  Erin's in a t-shirt, sitting on her mattress
     on the floor.  The paperwork from the box is now spread all
     over the floor around her.  She's reading a letter.

     CLOSE ON THE LETTER

     It's from PG&E, to Donna and Peter Irving.  We see the
     phrases, "purchase your house ...", "fair market value ..."

     CLOSE ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT

     It's a list of comparable house sales in the area.  Owner,
     cost; owner, cost.  Every house is in the $65,000 range.

     From another room, she hears the sound of BETH CRYING.  Still
     reading the file, Erin gets up and goes into:

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Still reading, Erin gets Beth out of her crib.  Beth quiets.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Erin lies down on the mattress and rests Beth on her chest.
     She sets down the file she was reading and picks up another.

     CLOSE ON THE FILE

     It contains a letter from a Dr. Howard Reeves.  The first
     paragraph contains the phrase "... medical examination of
     Donna and Peter Irving ..."

     Toward the end of the letter, there are two columns.  One is
     headed: "IN RANGE".  The other: "OUT OF RANGE".  Under that
     head appear the following: "lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes,
     natural killer cells, T Helpers, T8 suppresser cells".

     Erin stares at it, confused.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY

     Erin is talking to Jane, who's pouring herself coffee.

                               ERIN
            It was in this real estate file I'm valuing.
            And -- see, I know they're the medical
            records from the people selling the house --
            but it talks about things like lymphocytes
            and T8 suppressers.

     Erin sees Ed pass behind Jane.  She lowers her voice, so he
     won't see her asking for help.

                               ERIN
            I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but
            -- I'm just a little unclear on what those
            things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.

                               JANE
            What do I look like, Erin?  A library?

     And Jane walks away with her coffee.

     EXT. UCLA MAIN LIBRARY - DAY

     Large.  Looming.  Very establishment.  Through the windows,
     we see Erin at the desk, talking to a LIBRARIAN.  She has the
     file in her hands.  Over this:

                               ROSALIND (O.S.)
            Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich.
            From the file room?  I was wondering if you
            could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up
            on that real estate thing out of the office.

     The librarian gives her directions to somewhere else.

     EXT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY

     Smaller, but still establishment.  Erin's Hyundai pulls into
     the parking lot.

     INT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY

     Erin is at the reference desk, eating a candy bar while she
     talks to the LIBRARIAN.  He checks something on the computer.
     A couple of WHITE-COATED MEDICAL STUDENTS pass her, double-
     taking.  They don't see many like her around here.

     INT. UCLA SCIENCE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

     A long, academic hallway lit by fluorescents.  Erin gets off
     an elevator and heads down the hall.  She finds a door with a
     nameplate that reads "Jim Paulsen, Epidemiology" and KNOCKS.

     The door opens and DR. JIM PAULSEN appears.  He's a classic
     scientist: unruly hair, thick glasses.  Nothing like Erin has
     ever shown up at his door.  He reels at the sight of her.

                               ERIN
            Dr. Paulsen?

                               PAULSEN
            Yes?

                               ERIN
            Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in
            the library there, asking a mess of
            questions about -- I guess they call it
            epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me
            to find you, cause you know all about it.

                               PAULSEN
                        (suspicious)
            Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to
            this?

                               ERIN
            Who's Baxter?

                               PAULSEN
            He did, didn't he?  Baxter!

     BAXTER, another scientist, leans out of a door down the hall.

                               BAXTER
            Yeah?

     Baxter and Erin look at each other.  No recognition, of
     course.  Paulsen is immediately embarrassed.

                               PAULSEN
            Oh.  Oh.

                               ERIN
            No one put me up to anything.  I was just
            hoping I could ask you a couple questions.

                               PAULSEN
                        (mortified)
            Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --

     INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY

     Orderly chaos.  Dr. Paulsen, still recovering, has Erin's
     file in his hands.  Erin is sitting across from him.

                               PAULSEN
            Well, look, there isn't a ton of information
            here, but from what there is, I'd say that
            these two people here -- what are their
            names?  Shanna and Ashley?

                               ERIN
            Right, I guess those are the kids --

                               PAULSEN
            They've both got some immune system problem.
            Can't say what from, whether it's viral or
            genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And
            these guys -- Donna and Peter --

                               ERIN
            Their parents, I'm pretty sure.

                               PAULSEN
            Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say
            they both have some form of cancer.

     Wow.  That's more serious than Erin was expecting.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

     CLOSE ON THE FILE on the kitchen counter.  The Irvings' phone
     number is written on the front.  A PHONE IS RINGING.

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            Whoa, whoa!  Easy, easy, easy --

     WIDEN to see Erin, phone to her ear, grabbing a carton of
     juice from Matt and Katie, who are fighting over it at the
     table.  Just as she takes it from them, the phone picks up.

                               DONNA'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Hi!  You've reached the Irvings.  Leave a
            message and we'll get back to you just as
            soon as we can.  Bye-bye.

     BEEP.  Erin thinks a bit, then hangs up and looks at the
     file.  Scrawled on the cover is the Irvings' address, in
     Hinkley, California.

     EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - DAY

     The beat-up old Hyundai heads east out of L.A.  DISCO MUSIC
     blares from its speakers.

     EXT. HINKLEY, CA - DAY

     This is a dry, desolate part of California.  No downtown, no
     community.  Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with
     small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the
     landscape like occasional tombstones.

     A beat-up old sign on the road reads: "HINKLEY, CA.  POP: "
     but the  corner where the number would be has broken off.

     As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto
     Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley.

     INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAY

     Erin looks around.  The house she's passing has been razed.
     A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property.

     As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she
     drives by the PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray
     structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from
     the road.  Erin passes it without noticing it.

     She stops at an intersection.  The house on the corner has
     been boarded up with plywood.  Erin notices it -- depressing
     -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street.

     EXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAY

     A generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of
     nothing.  There's a pool out back and a chain link fence
     hugging the property.  No landscaping.  Dull, but clean.  A
     few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door.

     The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops.  Erin gets
     out.  As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into
     the dirt.  She rings the bell.  It has a melody chime.

     DONNA IRVING opens the door.  She's 35, petite, with a
     scrappy, high-strung manner.  She's wearing tight jeans, and
     her dark curls are piled on top of her head.

                               ERIN
            Hi.  Donna Irving?

                               DONNA
            Yes?

                               ERIN
            I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?

                               DONNA
                        (a little surprised)
            You're a lawyer?

                               ERIN
            Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for
            them.  You got a minute?

     INT. THE IRVINGS' HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

     The house is furnished with little money, but lots of care.
     Erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows.
     Out back, two GIRLS, ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool.

                               ERIN
            This is a real nice place you got here.

                               DONNA (O.S.)
            Well it oughta be, with all the work I put
            into it.

     She comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea.

                               DONNA
            I added air conditioning, put in the pool,
            made all those pillows by hand ...

                               ERIN
            Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that.
            They make the place feel real homey.

     Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows.

                               DONNA
            Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm
            being such a stickler on this house price
            thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's
            backside, especially after all they've done
            for Hinkley, but I look around here and I
            think, if they want this place, they're
            gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just
            mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay
            me for the trouble of starting over.

                               ERIN
            Right.

                               DONNA
            Cause first you gotta move, then there's
            decorating, and if the windows aren't the
            same size, you know -- you're making all new
            curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I
            have the energy.  You know, I've been sick.
            Me and Peter both have.

                               ERIN
            Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I
            was going through your file here, and I ran
            into these medical records.  They kinda
            surprised me --

     This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self-
     pitying.  But not Donna.  Life's handed her a shitload of
     lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade.

                               DONNA
            I know.  They're more than a bit unusual.
            See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's
            disease.  That's a kind of cancer --

                               ERIN
            Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.

                               DONNA
            Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the
            Lord, but you never know.  And then while
            that's going on, I end up having to have a
            hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps
            removed from my breasts.  All benign so far,
            but still, no matter how positive you stay,
            an operation can still take it out of you.

                               ERIN
            I'll say.  Holy moley.

                               DONNA
            So the whole idea of selling the house --
            don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to
            some better place, but if they aren't gonna
            pay us properly, I just don't see the point.

                               ERIN
            Yeah, I can see that.
                        (beat)
            I guess the only thing that confused me is -
            - not that your medical problems aren't
            important, but -- how come the files about
            them are in with all the real estate stuff?

     Donna tops off their iced teas.

                               DONNA
            Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if
            I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I
            just kept all PG&E correspondence in one
            place.

                               ERIN
            Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you
            were corresponding with PG&E about it in the
            first place.

                               DONNA
            Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.

                               ERIN
            They did?

                               DONNA
            You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole
            family.  And not like with insurance where
            you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed,
            either.  They just took care of it.  Just
            like that.  We never even saw a bill.

                               ERIN
            Wow.  Why would they do that?

                               DONNA
            Cause of the chromium.

                               ERIN
            The what?

                               DONNA
            The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this
            whole thing off.

     INT. IRVING HOUSE, GARAGE - DAY

     CLOSE ON A BOX, with "CHROM INFO" scrawled on it.

                               DONNA (O.S.)
            PG&E came around a few years ago, told us
            they put chromium in our well by mistake.
            And since we shouldn't have to drink it if
            we don't want to, they gave us free spring
            water and offered to buy our house.

     WIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room.

                               ERIN
            What's chromium?

                               DONNA
            It's a chemical they used over at that
            compressor station up the road there.

                               ERIN
            Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have
            been so sick --

                               DONNA
            I thought the same thing, right off the bat.
            That's why we went to see the doctor.  But
            hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do
            with the other.

     She rifles through the box.

                               DONNA
            This is the info they gave us.  You'll see
            if you look through it, chromium's good for
            you.  When I saw what they charged for it at
            the health-food stores, I about fainted.

     She hands Erin a printed fact sheet.  Erin scans it.

                               ERIN
            Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your
            water being messed with and you being so
            sick.

                               DONNA
            Not around here.  This is a rough part of
            the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money,
            not a lot of luck.
                        (beat)
            It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town
            like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.

     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Erin's driving away from Donna's house.  A street lamp throws
     light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat.

     She gets to an intersection and looks across the street at
     the massive COMPRESSOR STATION.  Six stories high, lit up
     like a Christmas tree, with all sizes of PIPES criss-crossing
     the outside and GIANT COOLING TOWERS sticking up out of it.
     Far more massive than anything else in town, it looms over
     the horizon like the Capitol in D.C. or St. Peter's in Rome.

     Erin takes a long look at the compressor station, then turns
     onto Community Boulevard and drives away.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

     Erin is holding Beth, making her a bottle, when she hears
     NOISES coming from outside.  She follows them.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

     Erin opens the door to find George attaching bars to her
     windows.

                               ERIN
            What're you doing?

                               GEORGE
            Better safe than sorry.

     She shakes her head, amused by his persistence.

                               ERIN
            You want some coffee, George?

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

     George follows Erin in.

                               GEORGE
            I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front
            door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest
            neighborhood in the world, you know.

                               ERIN
            Thanks for reminding me.

                               GEORGE
            I guess we get what we pay for, huh?

     Erin pours him some coffee, hands it to him.

                               ERIN
            You think it could make you sick, living in
            a place like this?

                               GEORGE
            What do you mean?

     George settles in, helps himself to sugar.

                               ERIN
            I was talking to this lady -- she and her
            husband both got cancer, and she thinks it's
            cause they live in a bad neighborhood.  You
            think that's possible?  That living in a bad
            neighborhood could give you cancer?

     George laughs a little at the thought.

                               GEORGE
            Man, I hope not.  You got enough damn
            problems.

     But Erin's still mulling it over.

     EXT. NORTHRIDGE, ERIN'S BLOCK - DAY

     Erin clips down the block in short-shorts and high-heeled
     boots.  Up ahead a few of DOWN-ON-THEIR-LUCK MEN are out on a
     stoop, drinking their breakfast.  Erin approaches them.

                               ERIN
            Hi, y'all -- how you doing today?

                               MAN 1
            Hangin' in, baby.  How about yourself?

                               ERIN
            I'm okay, I'm just fine.  I was wondering --
            could I maybe ask you a couple questions?

     She settles down on the stoop with them for a chat.

     INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY

     Dr. Paulsen and Erin are sitting, talking.  He's thrilled to
     have her back in his office.

                               ERIN
            ... and when I realized our area's just as
            bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors
            are all sick too.  So I went and asked.

                               PAULSEN
                        (surprised)
            You did?

     Erin digs a pad of paper out of her bag.

                               ERIN
            Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on
            doors.  And you know what?  They're not.
                        (reads from the pad)
            I mean, they got problems, but none of this
            cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So
            I don't know -- I just can't shake the
            feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they
            put in the water.

                               PAULSEN
            Well, if you're talking about contamination,
            you're getting out of my area of expertise.
            Let me give you the name of a toxicologist
            friend of mine over at USC.

     Paulsen reaches for a notepad, scrawls on it.

     INT. UCLA MEDICAL BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

     Paulsen is seeing Erin out of his office.

                               PAULSEN
            I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I
            did not peg you as the kind to go off and
            conduct her own epidemiological study.

                               ERIN
            Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my
            reputation.

     EXT. USC CAMPUS - DAY

     Erin towers over DAVID FRANKEL as she walks across campus
     with him.  He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia,
     Birkenstocks, bushy beard.  He's as dry as dust, and as much
     as Dr. Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her.

                               FRANKEL
            What kind of chromium is it?

                               ERIN
            There's more than one kind?

                               FRANKEL
            Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does
            all kinds of good things for the body.
            There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and
            then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium,
            which, depending on the amounts, can be very
            harmful.

                               ERIN
            Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?

                               FRANKEL
            With repeated exposure to toxic levels --
            God, anything, really -- respiratory
            disease, liver failure, heart failure,
            reproductive failure, chronic headaches,
            bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of
            course, any type of cancer.

     He rattles it off coolly.  Just facts.  Erin's stunned.

                               ERIN
            So that stuff -- it kills people.

                               FRANKEL
            Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly
            carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.

                               ERIN
            Well, how do I find out what kind of
            chromium is up in Hinkley?

                               FRANKEL
            Have you been to the water board?

                               ERIN
            Hunh-uh.  What's that?

                               FRANKEL
            Every county has one.  They keep records of
            anything water-related within their
            jurisdiction.  You should be able to find
            something there.

                               ERIN
            County water board.  All righty, thanks.

                               FRANKEL
            Good luck.
                        (beat)
            Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're
            looking for if I were you ...

     His line continues over:

     EXT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL WATER BOARD - DAY

     Erin's Hyundai pulls up and stops in a cloud of dust.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            ... Incriminating records have a way of
            disappearing when people smell trouble.

     Erin hops out, checks her reflection in the side-view mirror,
     then heads into the building.

     INT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL COUNTY WATER BOARD - DAY

     Drab, government-issue.  ROSS, the bored desk clerk is
     thumbing his way through ROAD & TRACK.  Just as he stops to
     stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling
     the hood of a car, the huge door opens and Erin enters.

                               ERIN
            Whew!  Goddamn, that's a heavy door.

     Ross looks up.  It's like the girl from the ad walked right
     off the page.  He jumps up, to help her with the door.

                               ROSS
            Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.

                               ERIN
            Thank you very much.  Aren't you a
            gentleman?  Mr. ...

                               ROSS
            Ross.

                               ERIN
            Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.

     She smiles.  He can't believe his luck.

                               ROSS
            Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?

                               ERIN
            Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl
            for some water records.

                               ROSS
                        (with a laugh)
            You come to the right place.

                               ERIN
                        (laughing along)
            I guess I did.

                               ROSS
            You just tell me what you want to look at
            and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.

                               ERIN
            I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's
            fighting his water bill, and he wants me to
            find all manner of bills from all kinds of
            places.  The easiest thing would probably be
            if I just squeezed back there with you and
            poked around myself.  Would that be okay?

                               ROSS
            Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need
            you to sign in here --

     He hands her a pen.  He reads over her shoulder as she signs
     her name -- Erin Pattee Brockovich.

                               ROSS
            Pattee?  That your middle name?

                               ERIN
            Nope.  Maiden.

                               ROSS
                        (disappointed)
            You're married.

                               ERIN
            Not anymore.

     She smiles and winks at him, then goes around the counter
     with him and looks at the stacks and stacks of files.

                               ERIN
            Well.  Here goes nothing.

     She heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files.
     They're all town names -- Barstow, Victorville, Oro Grande,
     Helendale -- in no particular order.  Finally, Erin spots one
     that says Hinkley.  She pulls it down.

     IN THE FILE 

     are pages and pages of Xeroxed memoranda, letters, charts, 
     graphs, handwritten notes.  All shoved in willy-nilly. 

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     George is watching a football game on TV.  He's just put TV
     dinners on the floor in front of the Matt and Katie. 

                               MATT 
            Our mom gives us sandwiches on Fridays. 

                               GEORGE
            That's a sandwich. 

                               KATIE
            No, it's not! 

                               GEORGE
            Sure it is.  Here, I'll show you. 

     He picks up Matt's chicken, tears it in two ... 

                               GEORGE 
            Most people think a sandwich's gotta have 
            bread on the outside.  Not true.  Chicken is
            a perfectly good outside for a sandwich.

     ... then places the broccoli neatly between the halves. 

                               GEORGE
            See? 

     Katie and Matthew look at it, then up at George, and smile.
     This guy just might be all right, after all. 

     EXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT 

     It's gotten dark.  Erin's Hyundai's still there.

     INT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT 

     Erin is on the floor, her legs stretched out in front of her. 
     She has a bunch of files open and spread across the floor.
     The one in her hand has caught her attention. 

     INSERT ON THE PAPER 

     It's a memo titled "CLEAN-UP AND ABATEMENT ORDER" from the
     water board to PG&E.  Erin is concentrating hard on it,
     reading laboriously to herself. 

                               ERIN (O.S.) 
            "... On December 7, 1987, the discharger
            notified the regional board and the San
            Bernardino County Environmental Health 
            Services of the discovery of 0.58 ppm of
            hexavalent chromium in an on-site ground
            water monitoring well ..."
                        (beat)
            ... hexavalent ... 

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY 

     CLOSE ON A XEROX OF THE ABATEMENT ORDER.  WIDEN to see it is
     on top of a stack of papers that Erin is carrying as she
     enters the office.  She has an efficient air about her -- a
     sense of purpose. 

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY 

     Erin swoops in, ready to work, only to find her desk cleared
     off.  She turns to Anna, who's already hard at work. 

                               ERIN
            Where's my stuff? 

     Anna looks up. 

                               ANNA 
            Where've you been?

                               ERIN
            What the fuck did you do with my stuff? 

                               ANNA 
            Don't use language with me -- 

     But Erin's out the door before Anna can finish her sentence.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, JANE'S OFFICE - DAY

     JANE is at her desk.  Erin barrels in.

                               ERIN 
            Someone stole my stuff. 

                               JANE 
            Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you. 

                               ERIN 
            I had photos of my kids, plus a mug -- 

     Jane reaches under her desk for a box, looks through it.

                               JANE 
            -- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of
            hose.  Here. 

                               ERIN
            What's going on? 

                               JANE 
            There may be jobs where you can disappear
            for days at a time, but this isn't one of 
            them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you
            don't get to stay. 

     She hands her the box.  Erin doesn't take it. 

                               ERIN 
            I've been working.  Shit, that's all I've
            been doing.  Ask Mr. Masry.  He knows. 

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY 

     Ed's at his desk, dialing the phone when Erin barrels in.

                               ERIN 
            You said to fire me?

     He sets down the receiver. 

                               ED 
            Erin, you've been gone for a week. 

                               ERIN 
            I left a message.  I've been dealing with 
            that real estate thing.  I was gonna write 
            up a whole damn report and --

                               ED 
            That's not how we work here.  You don't just
            leave a message and take off.

     Jane follows her in, still carrying the box of stuff. 

                               ERIN 
            What am I supposed to do, check in every two
            seconds? 

                               JANE 
            Yes.  It's called accountability. 

                               ERIN 
            I am not talking to you, bitch. 

                               JANE
            Excuse me?

                               ED
            Okay, enough -- 
                        (beat) 
            Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I 
            don't think this is the right place for you.
            So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on 
            your behalf.  Find you something else, okay? 

                               ERIN
            Don't bother. 

     She turns to Jane, takes her box, and heads out. 

                               ED 
            Come on, I'm trying to help here. 

                               ERIN 
            Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty
            about firing someone with three kids to
            feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that. 

     And she leaves. 

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY 

     As Erin heads for the door, pleased glances fly from 
     secretary to secretary.  Erin reaches the door, but can't
     open it with the box in her arms.  She turns to the room. 

                               ERIN 
            I don't suppose any one of you cunts could
            open the fucking door for me. 

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY 

     Erin's Hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house.  Erin
     shoves open the creaky, reluctant door, lifts her box of
     stuff off the seat, and gets out. 

     As she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs
     into the MAILMAN.  He hands her a packet of mail. 

                               MAILMAN 
            Here ya go, Miz Brockovich. 

     Erin looks at the top of the stack.  It's the electric bill.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY 

     Erin enters, puts down the box and stares at the mail. 
     Bills, bills, and more bills.  As she throws them on the
     table, she sees George coming out of the kitchen.

                               ERIN
            What are you doing here? 

                               GEORGE 
            Fixing a leak under your sink. 

     She heads into the kitchen, weary and irritated. 

                               ERIN 
            I didn't ask you to do that.  Damn it, 
            George, I don't ask you to do things like
            that. 

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 

     Erin enters, sees all the cleaning stuff from under the sink
     is spread around the kitchen floor.  A tool box lies open. 

                               ERIN
            Great. 

                               GEORGE
            I'm gonna clean it up. 

     Erin gets down on her knees and starts putting things away. 

                               GEORGE 
            Relax, Erin, I'll do it -- I'm not --

     Before he can finish, a huge WATER BUG runs onto Erin's hand. 

                               ERIN
            Ugh -- Jesus -- 

     She jumps and brushes it off. 

                               GEORGE 
            Yeah -- you had a whole family of those
            things hanging out back there. 

     She takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug, missing it. 

                               ERIN
            Damn it -- 

     The bug skitters away from her, along the floorboard.  Erin
     chases it, smacking at it repeatedly, missing it every time. 

                               GEORGE
            Don't worry about it, I'll get it later. 

     But Erin keeps after it, corralling all her frustrations into
     killing that one bug. 

                               ERIN 
            Come here, you little motherfucker --

     The bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt,
     the pepper, the napkin holder.  Erin keeps after it, BANGING
     the table harder and harder with each SMACK of her shoe.

                               GEORGE
            Hey, whoa -- relax --
         
     The salt and pepper skid off the table.  The napkins fly from
     their holder.  Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips
     into a crack in the wall and disappears.  Erin hurls her shoe
     at the crack.  It SMASHES into the wall.

                               ERIN
            GOD DAMN IT!

     As Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts
     to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears.
     She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her.
         
                               ERIN
                        (almost a whisper)
            ... God damn it.
         
     She looks around at her for-shit kitchen and starts to cry.
         
                               ERIN
            What kind of person lives like this?  Huh?
            What kind of person lets her kids run around
            in a house crawling with bugs the size of
            housecats?
         
                               GEORGE
            It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them.
            All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
         
                               ERIN
            I can't call an exterminator.  I can't afford
            one.  God, I can't even afford my phone.
                        (beat)
            I got fired.
         
                               GEORGE
            What?  But you been working so hard --
         
                               ERIN
            Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of
            difference.
                        (then, fragile)
            Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me?
            How'd I end up so ... so nothing?
         
     George picks a napkin up off the floor, hands it to her.

                               GEORGE
            You're not nothing, Erin.

                               ERIN
            Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I
            was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of
            those great lives, with everything all laid-
            out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss
            Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you
            that?  You live next door to a real live
            beauty queen.
                        (wipes her nose)
            I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I
            thought it meant something.  I thought it
            meant I was gonna do something great with my
            life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow
            up to be someone.
         
                               GEORGE
            You are someone.

                               ERIN
            No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.

                               GEORGE
            You're someone to me.
                        (beat)
            You're someone real special to me.
         
     He takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her, very
     close.  He takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on
     her foot.  Then he takes her hands in his and kisses them.
         
                               ERIN
            I'm no good, George.  I make people
            miserable.
         
     But he kisses her anyway.  And for the first time in so long,
     she feels like something other than a failure.  He pulls her
     into him, and she lets herself be pulled.
         
     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - DAY
         
     Erin and George are in bed, naked, curled around each other.

                               GEORGE
            Man.  Even your earlobes are beautiful.
         
     He kisses one.
         
                               ERIN
            Don't be too nice to me, okay?  It makes me
            nervous.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
         
     Ed is at his desk.  The PHONE RINGS.  And RINGS.  And RINGS.

                               ED
            Brenda!
                        (no answer)
            BRENDA!

     Nothing.  Ed growls in frustration, then gets the phone.

                               ED
            Yeah, Ed Masry here ... She doesn't work
            here anymore.  Who's this?
         
     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
         
     CLOSE ON THE TABLE, where Beth is bobbing in her baby chair.
     On one side of her is a heap of bills with "PAST DUE" and
     "PLEASE REMIT" stamped on them.  On the other, the well-
     thumbed CLASSIFIED SECTION, with circles and X's all over it.

     The DOORBELL rings.  Erin swoops in and picks up Beth.

                               ERIN
            Come on, baby.  Maybe that's Ed McMahon.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY
         
     Erin carries Beth over to the front door, spies through the
     peephole, and sees Ed standing there.  She opens the door.
         
                               ERIN
            What are you doing here?

                               ED
            I got an interesting call this afternoon.
            It was from a Dr. Frankel.
         
                               ERIN
            Oh, yeah?

                               ED
            He wanted you to know the legal limit for
            hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per
            million.  And that at the rate you
            mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for
            the cancers in that family you asked about.
            The Irvings.
         
                               ERIN
            Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny
            how some people go out of their way to help
            people and others just give 'em the ax?

                               ED
            Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just
            assumed you were off having fun.

                               ERIN
            Now, why in the hell would you assume that?

                               ED
            I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like
            someone who has a lot of fun.

                               ERIN
            Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
         
     Ed takes a beat, copping to the charge.
         
                               ED
            So what's the story on this thing?  This
            cancer stuff?
         
                               ERIN
            You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I
            got a lot of bills to pay.
         
     He glares at her.  Realizes he has no choice.
         
                               ED
            Fine.
         
     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER
         
     Erin has let Ed in.  They're sitting.
         
                               ED
            But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
         
                               ERIN
            They told her something, but it can't have
            been too specific, cause I talked to her,
            and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
         
                               ED
            So what made you think it was?
         
                               ERIN
            It doesn't take a genius to look at those
            medical records and think something's wrong.

                               ED
            What medical records?

                               ERIN
            The ones in the box of files.
                        (off Ed's blank look)
            The box of files?  The one from your office?

                               ED
            I didn't see any medical records in there.

                               ERIN
            Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it
            then, huh?
                        (to herself)
            And you fired me.  Jesus.
         
     Ed thinks for a moment.

                               ED
            That document you found, the one that says
            it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen
            to make a copy did you?

                               ERIN
            Course I did.

                               ED
            Lemme see it, will you?

     Before getting it for him, she looks at him, weighs her odds.
         
                               ERIN
            I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including
            dental.
         
                               ED
            Look, Erin, this is not the way I do
            business, this extortion nonsense.
         
     Erin doesn't budge.
         
                               ED
            Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
         
                               ERIN
            Ten.
                        (off his look)
            There's a lot of other places I could work.
         
                               ED
            A ten percent raise and benefits.  But
            that's it.  I'm drawing the line.

     She goes to her box of stuff from the office and digs out the
     document for him.  He scans it.
         
                               ED
            This is the only thing you found?

                               ERIN
            So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I
            wouldn't be surprised if there's more.

                               ED
            Find out.

     EXT. 10 FREEWAY - DAY

     Erin's Hyundai zips along the freeway.  "Funky Town" is
     blaring from the tinny stereo.  Over it:

                               MATTHEW (O.S.)
            I hate this music.

     INT. HYUNDAI - DAY

     Erin's driving.  Matthew's in the front seat.  Katie and Beth
     (in a car seat) are in the back.

                               ERIN
            There's no way a son of mine hates Funky
            Town.  It's impossible.

                               MATTHEW
            Well I hate it.

                               KATIE
            I hate it too.  I hate this trip.

                               ERIN
            Oh, come on, where's your sense of
            adventure?  We're going someplace you never
            been before.

                               KATIE
            I'm gonna hate it.

                               MATTHEW
            Me too.

     She glances at them, frowns a little.

                               ERIN
            You know what I'm realizing for the first
            time?  You kids are a couple of downers.  I
            mean, you are the real thing -- a couple of
            honest-to-God depresso-types.
                        (small smile)
            Who in the heck raised you, anyway?  Some
            kind of moron?
         
     Katie smiles a little.  She likes this side of her mom.
         
                               KATIE
            Yeah.  A real moron.

                               ERIN
            Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired,
            bimbo, I bet.

                               MATTHEW
                        (also smiling)
            Yeah.

                               ERIN
            Thank God we got you away from her, huh?

     By now they're all smiling.  Funky Town plays on.

     EXT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY

     The Hyundai is parked at the entrance to the station, by a
     row of dead trees.  Erin is standing beside a sign that says
     "Private Property.  No Trespassing", taking pictures of the
     massive structure in the distance.  Matthew, Katie, and Beth
     are drawing in the dirt with sticks.

                               ERIN
            Stay out of the road.  I'll be right back.

     She wanders up the drive, onto PG&E property, moving around
     the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle.

     As she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the
     plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and
     notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue.
     She looks at the dirt right her feet.  Kicks the ground.

     Below the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green.  Erin
     notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt.
     Worry comes over her face.  She heads back to them.

     EXT. HINKLEY MART - DAY

     The kids are waiting at the car.  Erin comes out of the store
     with a bottle of water and uses it to rinse off their hands.

     EXT. WATER BOARD - DAY

     The sound of a BABY CRYING.  The Hyundai's parked in front.

                               MATTHEW (O.S.)
            I'm hungry.

     INT. WATER BOARD - DAY

     Erin is at the Xerox machine, copying a file while she tries
     to calm Beth.  There's a stack of files on the nearby table.
     Matthew and Katie are flopping around on the floor.

                               ERIN
            We'll go eat in a minute.  Settle down.

     Whining, fussing.  Ross goes over to her.

                               ROSS
            You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time
            here.  Why don't you let me do that for you,
            and you can get your kids some dinner.

                               ERIN
            Ross -- you are an absolute angel.

     She hands Ross the STACK OF DOCUMENTS.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY

     Ed comes in in the morning, and without pausing, hands Brenda
     a copy of the STACK OF DOCUMENTS, with a Post-it on the top.

                               ED
            Fax these to this number, okay?

                               BRENDA
            All of 'em?

                               ED
            All of them.

     He continues into his office and closes the door.

     CLOSE ON THE FAX MACHINE LED

     Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up on
     the LED: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.

     INT. IRVING HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Another copy of those DOCUMENTS, now in Donna's hands.  She's
     on her couch with Erin, reading them.  Outside, Donna's two
     daughters are playing in the pool.  She reads the last page
     and looks up at Erin, bewildered.

                               DONNA
            An on-site monitoring well?  That means --

                               ERIN
            It was right up on the PG&E property over
            there.

                               DONNA
            And you say this stuff, this hexavalent
            chromium -- it's poisonous?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.

                               DONNA
            Well -- then it's gotta be a different than
            what's in our water, cause ours is okay.
            The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right
            in the kitchen and said it was fine.

                               ERIN
            I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking
            to?  He gave me a list of problems that can
            come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And
            everything you all have is on that list.

     Donna resists this idea hard.

                               DONNA
            No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the
            doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely
            nothing to do with the other.

                               ERIN
            Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by
            PG&E?

     Donna sits quietly, trying to make sense of this.  The only
     sound is the LAUGHING and SPLASHING from the pool out back.
     Then, gradually, Donna realizes what it is she's hearing --
     her kids playing in toxic water.  She jumps up ...

                               DONNA
            ASHLEY!  SHANNA!

     ... and runs out to the pool.  Erin follows her.

     EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY

     From the door, Erin watches Donna run to the edge of the pool
     in a frantic response to this news.

                               DONNA
            OUT OF THE POOL!  BOTH OF YOU, OUT OF THE
            POOL, RIGHT NOW!

                               SHANNA
            How come?

                               DONNA
            CAUSE I SAID SO, THAT'S WHY, NOW GET OUT!
            OUT!  NOW!!!

     Erin watches compassionately as Donna flails to get her kids
     out of the contaminated water.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     It's morning.  Ed is checking the lie of his tie in his
     reflection in the window.  Erin is on his couch, high-heeled
     legs stretched out in front of her.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

     Jane is delivering paychecks.  When Brenda gets to her desk,
     Jane tips her head toward Ed's office, as if to say, check it
     out.  Brenda peers in and sees Erin.

                               BRENDA
            What's she doing here?
         
                               JANE
            He hired her back.  With a raise.

                               BRENDA
            What??  Why?

                               JANE
            Well, let's see.  It's not cause she's
            smart, and it's not cause she's
            professional.  That leaves ...

     Brenda's stunned.  Takes a beat.  Makes assumptions.

                               BRENDA
            And dumb old me thought working hard and
            being loyal was the way to get ahead.

     INT. ED'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Ed is still checking his reflection.

                               ED
            I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the
            fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed
            that send button -- PG&E claims department
            is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.

                               ERIN
            So you think we got 'em scared?

                               ED
            It sure as hell sounded like they were
            sitting up and taking notice.

     Brenda pops her head in, ignores Erin.

                               BRENDA
            David Baum from PG&E is at reception.
         
     Erin feels the chill Brenda's sending her way.

                               ERIN
            Nice to see you again, too, Brenda.

     Brenda leaves without acknowledging Erin.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     Ed and Erin come out and see DAVID BAUM waiting at reception.
     Forget law school, this kid looks like he's just out of
     twelfth grade.  Not a hair on his chin.  His suit and shoes
     look brand new.

                               ERIN
            Not to question your judgment or anything,
            Mr. Masry, but -- that doesn't exactly look
            like sitting up and taking notice to me.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Ed and Erin are seated across the table from Baum. To say
     this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement.  He
     doesn't talk; he squeaks.

                               BAUM
            ... in the interest of putting this whole
            thing to rest, PG&E is willing to offer the
            Irvings 250,000 dollars for their home.

     Ed laughs a little in disbelief.

                               ED
            250,000?

                               BAUM
            In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr.
            Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.

                               ED
            What about in terms of medical expenses?
            250,000 doesn't come close to what this
            family's gonna have to spend on doctors.

                               BAUM
            I understand they've had a bad run of luck,
            health-wise, and they have my sympathies.
            But that's not PG&E's fault.

                               ED
            You're kidding, right?
                        (Baum doesn't answer)
            Look at these readings for Christ's sake.
            PG&E's own technicians documented toxic
            levels of hexavalent chromium in those test
            wells, on numerous occasions.

     Ed shoves them across the table.  Baum doesn't look at them.

                               ED
            Everything the Irvings have had is a proven
            reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium.
            They've had ...

     He stalls a moment.  Erin jumps in.

                               ERIN
            -- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's
            disease, immune deficiencies, asthma,
            chronic nosebleeds.

     Despite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously
     the party line:

                               BAUM
            A million things could have caused those
            problems.  Poor diet, bad genes,
            irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final
            and more than fair.

                               ED
            Wait a minute -- I thought we were
            negotiating here.

                               BAUM
            250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.

     Ed looks across at this pissant little kid.

                               ED
                        (to himself)
            Jesus Christ.
                        (he stands, to leave)
            I will present your offer to my clients.  I
            doubt they'll accept it.

     As Ed starts out:

                               BAUM
            Mr. Masry, before you go off on some
            crusade, you might want to remember who it
            is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28-
            billion dollar corporation.

                               ED
                        (containing his anger)
            Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.

     And Ed leaves the conference room.  Erin follows him out.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     Erin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office.

                               ERIN
            At least they made an offer.

                               ED
            That wasn't an offer.  A million would've
            been an offer.  When they send the God damn
            mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my
            time, it's a fuck you.

                               ERIN
            I don't get why they'd do that.

                               ED
            Because they can.  You heard that kid --
            they have 28 billion dollars at their
            disposal.  They can afford to waste all the
            time in the world.

                               ERIN
            And you can't?

                               ED
            What, you think I'm made of money?

     Behind them, Baum steps out of the conference room.

                               BAUM
            Hey, you know where I can get a cab?  My
            plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes.

     Ed turns and looks at him.  He gets a tiny smile.

                               ED
            Tell you what, why don't you go on over to
            reception, tell them I said Mario should
            take you to the airport.

                               BAUM
            Hey, excellent.  Thanks.

     Baum heads out to the reception area.

                               ERIN
            Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the
            bathroom.  They'll be driving around the
            valley for hours.

                               ED
                        (gleeful)
            Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?

     She watches him go into his office, impressed.  Big smile.

                               ERIN
            Well I'll be God damned.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     End of the day.  Most everyone has left.  Erin is at her new
     work space near Ed's office.  She's poring over a fat file of
     documents.  ROSALIND wanders by with her coat on.

                               ROSALIND
            You've been reading for hours.

                               ERIN
            I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact
            that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".

                               ROSALIND
            Hey, just so long as you see Him.

     Rosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out.

     Outside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to
     a lost-looking COUPLE IN THEIR MID-30's.  These are MANDY and
     TOM BROWN.  He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope
     under his arm.  Rosalind points to Erin.  The Browns enter
     the office and approach her.

                               MANDY
            Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  Who are you?

                               TOM
            I'm Tom Brown.  This is my wife Mandy.  We
            used to live across the street from the
            Irvings.  PG&E bought our house last year.

     INT. ERIN'S DESK - LATER
         
     CLOSE ON photos of chickens, each with a twisted, limp neck.

                               TOM
            It's called wry neck.  It's when they're
            born without any muscles in the neck.

     WIDEN to see Erin looking at them with Tom and Mandy.

                               ERIN
            Wow.  How many were born like this?

                               TOM
            Twelve, maybe thirteen.

                               MANDY
            When Donna told us about you, and what you
            told her about the chromium, we figured that
            might have something to do with this, too.

                               ERIN
            It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.

     She tucks them into a file, as if that's it.

                               MANDY
            There's something else, too.

                               ERIN
            What?

                               TOM
            Well.  Mandy here's had nine miscarriages.

                               ERIN
            Are you kidding?  My God --

                               MANDY
            I know.  It's an awful lot.

                               ERIN
            I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.

                               TOM
            She doesn't know.  No one does.  It's not
            something you want to talk about, you know?

                               MANDY
            I figured it musta been something I did,
            like when I smoked marijuana, maybe.  Or
            took birth control pills.  But then Donna
            told me you thought this chromium might be
            to blame for her problems, so I figured ...

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Matt and Katie are in bed, with the light off.  Erin comes
     in, quietly, in clothes from work.

                               ERIN
            Hey.  You guys still awake?

     CLOSE ON MATT AND KATIE.  They're awake and pissed.

                               ERIN
            Come on, now.  No faking.  George told me he
            just shut out the light a few seconds ago.

     They still don't answer.  She comes in and sits on a bed.

                               ERIN
            Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this
            job is, things come up at the last minute,
            real important things, and I gotta deal with
            them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner
            any more than you do, but we're all gonna
            have to get used to it, cause the fact is,
            it's gonna happen sometimes.

                               KATIE
            It happens all the time.

                               ERIN
            That's not true; we had dinner together just
            last night.

                               MATT
            You were reading the whole time.

     He's got a point there.  Erin feels like shit.

                               ERIN
            I'm sorry, pumpkins.  I'll try a whole lot
            harder to be around, okay?  I promise.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The room is dark.  Erin enters and flops down onto the bed,
     exhausted.  George is lying on the bed next to her.

                               GEORGE
            If it's any consolation, I love you.

     EXT. ROUTE 10, INLAND EMPIRE - DAY

     Dry, flat California.  Ed's big old Mercedes is toodling down
     the freeway, at an overly safe, almost-geriatric speed.

     INT. ED'S MERCEDES - DAY

     Frank Sinatra is playing on the stereo.  Ed is swaying in
     time.  This is his kind of music.  He smiles, looks at Erin.

                               ED
            It's Sinatra's world, we just live in it.

     Whatever.  Erin glances at the speedometer.  Oy.  So slow.
     His car phone rings.  He picks it up.

                               ED
            Hello? ...
                        (his voice softens)
            Hi, babys.  Baby's fine.  Yes, I did.  I
            did, too, you just didn't feel it.

     He starts swerving across the lane markers.  THWACK THWACK
     THWACK.  Ed doesn't notice.  Erin's getting nervous.

                               ED
            You think I could leave without kissing my
            babys?  Okay, here you go.

     He kisses into the phone.  Swerves.  A car barely misses
     them.  Erin's eyes widen.  Not fun at all.

                               ED
            Bye-bye ... bye-bye ... no, you.  Okay,
            together.  Bye-bye.

     He finally hangs up, smiling to himself.  Erin clears her
     throat.

                               ERIN
            Um -- you mind pulling over?  Just -- for a
            second?

     EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

     The Mercedes pulls to a stop on the shoulder.  Erin gets out,
     walks around to the driver's side.  Opens the door.

                               ERIN
            First of all, don't talk baby talk to your
            wife in front of me.  It really undermines
            your authority.  And second, I know you're
            my boss and all, but you are the worst
            fucking driver I've ever seen.  Move over or
            I quit.

     He moves over.  She gets in, turns off the Sinatra.  They
     pull back out onto the freeway in silence.

     EXT. MANDY BROWN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The Mercedes and a truck are parked out front.

                               PETE (O.S.)
            There's something about this whole thing I
            don't quite understand, Mr. Masry.

     INT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Donna and Pete Irving, and Mandy and Roy Brown are all
     seated, sipping iced tea.  While they talk, Erin hands them
     all information packets on chromium.  Ed is standing in front
     of them, a little stiff.

                               PETE
            If PG&E messed with our water, why would
            they bother saying anything about it to us?
            Why not just keep quiet about it?

                               ED
            To establish a statute of limitations.  See,
            in a case like this, you only have a year
            from the time you first learn about the
            problem to file suit.  So PG&E figures,
            we'll let the cat out of the bag -- tell the
            people the water's not perfect; if we can
            ride out the year with no one suing, we'll
            be in the clear forever.

                               DONNA
            But it was more than a year ago that they
            told us --

                               ED
            It's okay.  We're not suing.  All we're
            doing is using this information to get you
            a real nice purchase price on your house,
            and get you two --
                        (to the Browns)
            -- a comparable retroactive bonus added to
            your sale price.  This way, and PG&E can
            still look good to their shareholders, cause
            they're not involved in an ugly lawsuit; all
            they're doing is buying a little property.

     Roy looks up from his retainer agreement.

                               ROY
            It doesn't say here how much this whole
            thing's gonna cost us.

                               ED
            My fee's forty percent of whatever you get
            awarded.

     Erin watches them look around at each other, stunned by the
     figure.

                               ERIN
            Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I
            heard that number, I said you got to be
            kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?

                               ED
            Erin --

                               ERIN
            I'm the one who's injured, and this joker
            who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk
            away with almost half my reward?

                               ED
            Erin --

     Erin's enjoying Ed's discomfort almost too much to stop.  But
     just almost.  She shifts gears.

                               ERIN
            Then I asked him how much he makes if I
            didn't get anything.

     They look at Ed.  Well?

                               ED
            Then I don't get anything either.

                               ERIN
            And I realized, he's taking a chance too.

     When they hear this, and realize he's in it with them, they
     all reach for their pens and sign.   They hand the agreements
     over to Erin, who takes them across the room to Ed.  He
     stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up.  That's that.

                               ED
            All right, then.  Let's hit the road.

     Boy.  Cold as ice.  Erin stares at him, stunned by his
     brusque manner, then leans in to him, close.

                               ERIN
                        (whispering)
            Mr. Masry, if you don't mind my saying, you
            got a lot to learn about being friendly.
            These people just hired you as their lawyer.
            The least you could do is make a little
            pleasant conversation.

     She gives him a stern look, then turns toward the women.
         
                               ERIN
            Donna, let me help you clean all this up.

     She picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the
     kitchen.  Donna and Mandy follow, leaving Ed alone with Pete
     and Roy.  He stands there, awkwardly.  Then, finally:

                               ED
            So, what's, uh ... what's new?

     INT. DONNA'S KITCHEN - DAY

     Erin and Donna are putting away the cleaned glasses.  Mandy
     is scanning the chromium pamphlet Erin gave her.

                               MANDY
            You know that thing it says in here about
            rashes?

                               ERIN
            Uh-huh?

                               MANDY
            Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood
            -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed
            like someone in his family always had a rash
            somewhere or other.  I just figured it was
            something in the genes.  And you know how it
            is -- you don't like to ask about things
            like that ...

     Erin listens, interested.

     EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY, BARN - DAY

     Another day.  BOB LINWOOD, 40's and gruff, is in the barn,
     tossing hay around.

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            Excuse me.  Are you Mr. Linwood?

     He sees Erin picking her way toward him in her high-heels.

                               LINWOOD
            Yeah?

                               ERIN
            I'm Erin Brockovich.  I work at the law firm
            that represents your former neighbors the
            Browns.  They suggested I give you a call.

     She steps in a cow patty.  Laughs at herself good-naturedly.

                               ERIN
            Boy howdy, did I ever wear the wrong shoes.

     EXT. THE DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY

     CLOSE ON A SIGN that reads: THE DESOTOS, hanging on the side
     of a small, paint-chipped house.  Erin is at the door talking
     to MARY DESOTO, 65, who's wearing a big cross at her breast.

                               ERIN
            ... and Mr. Linwood seemed to think that
            your husband had been sick as well.

                               MARY
            Yes, Mr. DeSoto has lung cancer.  Never
            smoked a day in his life, neither.

     INT. LAURA AND MIKE AMBROSINO'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin is talking to MIKE and LAURA AMBROSINO -- 30's.  Solid,
     family folks.  But Laura's left brow and cheekbone look
     swollen and misshapen, and she's trying to hide the fact that
     she's in a lot of pain.

                               ERIN
            Mrs. DeSoto said she wasn't sure exactly
            what it was that you had --

                               PETE
            She's not alone on that one.

                               LAURA
            Well, they know what it is -- it's called
            fibrous dysplasia --

                               PETE
            The bones start growing again.  Gives her
            headaches like you wouldn't believe.

                               LAURA
            -- they just don't know what caused it.

     INT. RITA AND TED DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY

     Erin is talking to TED AND RITA DANIELS.  Their daughter
     ANNABELLE, 10, is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket.

                               ERIN
            ... then Mike Ambrosino remembered seeing
            you folks at the hospital from time to time
            too, so I thought I'd just stop by.
                        (to Annabelle)
            You must be Annabelle.

                               ANNABELLE
            Uh-huh.

                               ERIN
            Whew, are you ever a beauty.  I mean, you
            must drive those boys crazy.

     Annabelle smiles a little.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Late night.  George rolls over -- Erin's side of the bed is
     empty.  He checks the clock, then gets up and heads into:

     INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     He peers around and spots her, sitting in the little kid's
     chair in Matthew and Katie's room.

     Erin is holding Beth, watching Matt and Katie sleep.  Erin
     hears the floor creak as George steps into the doorway.

                               ERIN
            Tell me something, George.  What kind of God
            lets a beautiful little 10-year-old girl get
            brain cancer?  Isn't He supposed to be in
            charge of stuff like that?  Make sure it
            doesn't happen?
                        (beat)
            I swear, any other job, He'd be fired.

     EXT. VALLEY SIDEWALK - DAY

     Ed and Erin are walking down the street, take-out coffee cups
     in their hands.  Ed is sipping his, but Erin is in too much
     of a lather to drink hers.

                               ED
            Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.

                               ERIN
            That's crazy -- why not?

                               ED
            Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason
            PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a
            quiet little real estate dispute.  We add
            plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle
            of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem --
            against a massive utility.  No, thank you.

     They go into their office building.

     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

     Erin and Ed are riding up.

                               ERIN
            Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up
            to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest
            people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend
            every single day watching their little girl
            fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll
            tell them we can't help them cause you don't
            feel like working that hard.

                               ED
            It's not about working hard --

                               ERIN
            Bullshit.

                               ED
            -- It's about being realistic.  Something
            like this, Erin -- it could take forever.
            They're a huge corporation.  They'd
            completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just
            one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.

                               ERIN
            -- who happens to know they poisoned people
            and lied about it.

     The doors open.  Ed gets off.  Erin follows.

     INT. MASRY LAW OFFICE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

     Erin's dogging Ed down the hall, to the office.

                               ERIN
            And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not
            only does it attack every organ of the body,
            it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means
            these people's genes, and the genes of their
            kids, and the genes of their grandkids --

                               ED
            I know how DNA works, Erin --

     He gets to the Masry & Vititoe doors.  Opens them.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY

     Erin tails Ed back to his office.

                               ERIN
            We can get these people.  With a little
            effort, I really think we can nail their
            asses to the wall.

                               ED
            Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise,
            you believe that?

                               ERIN
            Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit.
            But I know the difference --

     He shuts his office door on her.

                               ERIN
            -- BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG!

     INT. ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ed goes over to his desk, sits down.  He sees a stack of
     messages there, starts flipping through them.  Then he stops.

                               ED
            Damn it.

     He shoves the messages aside and puts his head in his hands.
     He sits like that for a moment, GROANS to himself.  Then he
     pushes himself up and heads over to his door.

     When he opens it, he finds Erin still standing there, exactly
     where he left her, arms crossed.  She hasn't budged.

                               ED
            How many families we talking about here?

                               ERIN
            Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.

                               ED
            You think there's more?

                               ERIN
            Well -- I found one document at the water
            board that had a toxic test well reading
            from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have
            lived on that land since then.

     Ed pauses, groans again, realizing what decision he's making.

                               ED
            This is a whole different ball game, Erin.
            A much bigger deal.

                               ERIN
            Kinda like David and what's-his-name?

                               ED
            Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole
            fucking family.
                        (heavy sigh)
            Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if,
            you find me the evidence to back all this up
            -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.

     She smiles victoriously.

                               ERIN
            You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.

                               ED
            Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm
            filing for bankruptcy.

     He heads back to his desk.  Erin follows him into his office.

                               ERIN
            Course, gathering evidence -- now, that's a
            big job.  A hell of a lot bigger than just
            filing.  I'm gonna be working a lot harder
            now, taking on a lot more responsibility ...

     He gives her a look.  Knows what's coming.

                               ED
            What now?

                               ERIN
            Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all
            the time I'm gonna be spending on the road,
            I'll probably be needing my own cel phone,
            won't I?

     INT. TOYS 'R' US - DAY

     CLOSE ON A BEEPING CEL PHONE

     as Erin tries to program numbers into its speed dial.  WIDEN
     to see she is reading from the phone's manual as she enters
     Toys 'R' Us with George, Matthew, Katie and Beth.

                               ERIN
            You each can pick out four things.  But
            nothing huge.  Look at the price.  Nothing
            crazy.

     Matthew and Katie fan out into the store.  Erin keeps messing
     with the phone.

                               GEORGE
            You can buy 'em all the toys you want, but
            come Monday, when you split again, they're
            still gonna be pissed.

     Erin looks over at him, weary.

                               ERIN
            George, I am just trying to do something
            nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could
            you please not give me a hard time about it?

                               GEORGE
            One toy per kid is doing something nice.
            Four is ... something else.

                               ERIN
            Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh?
            They're scarred for life.  They're gonna
            start holding up 7-11's any day now.

                               GEORGE
            I'm just saying --

                               ERIN
                        (with intensity)
            I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna
            hear it.  I am doing the best I can.

     And she walks away from him.

     EXT. HINKLEY, ROADSIDE DITCH - DAY

     Erin, in high heels and miniskirt, is straddling a ditch,
     scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic
     containers.  Over this:

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            Dr. Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich.  Tell me
            something: if I wanna find as much evidence
            of hexavalent chromium contamination as I
            possibly can, what should I do?

     As Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side
     of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk.

     EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - NIGHT

     Erin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked
     "No Trespassing".  Her arms are full of more containers.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            Well, what you have to remember is, if you
            have hex chrom in the water, you have it in
            anything that lived off the water.

     She adds them to a growing collection of containers in the
     trunk of her car.

     EXT. HINKLEY, THE POOL BEHIND AN ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

     Another day.  This time it's RAINING.  Erin minces her way
     down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            What I'd do is start a collection.  Anything
            that existed in water, on water, under water
            ...

     She gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of
     rancid pool water and seals it.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            anything that had water flow over or under
            it ...

     Erin spots a few dead frogs in the water.  She picks one up
     by the leg, and seals it in a plastic bag as well.

     EXT. WELL - DAY

     With a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up
     over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against
     one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts
     shimmying down the well.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            anything that had water pass through it ...

     INSIDE THE WELL

     she winces at the algae and gook that's clinging to her as
     she descends to the water level.  When she's low enough, she
     takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY

     Erin's at her desk, bending over her notebook in a miniskirt,
     adding reports to the TOXICOLOGY binder.

                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
            ... collect 'em, label 'em, then bring 'em
            to me.  I'll analyze 'em, see what we got.

     ON THE REPORTS: We catch a few words: "water sample A ...",
     "soil sample D ...", "frog sample A ...", "... traces of
     hexavalent ..."

     Brenda looks at Erin and sees her hem rising in the back.

                               BRENDA
            For God's sake, Erin, I can see your
            panties.

     Erin turns to Brenda, relishing the chance to irritate her.

                               ERIN
            Liar.  I'm not wearing any.

     Ed, in his office, laughs.  He's starting to like this gal.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     It's a hot night.  George is playing on the floor with the
     kids.  Erin is behind them on the couch, laboriously reading
     a book labeled, simply, CHROMIUM.  The phone RINGS.  Erin
     picks it up.

                               ERIN
            Hello?

                               MALE VOICE (O.S.)
            Is this the Erin Pattee Brockovich that's
            been snooping around the water board?

     His voice is flat, creepy.  Not friendly.

                               ERIN
            Yes.  Who's this?

     CLICK.  Erin stares at the phone, freaked.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

     George watches Erin double-checking the locks on the door.

                               ERIN
            I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone
            call, George.

                               GEORGE
            Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your
            bills, not put you in danger.

                               ERIN
            I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt.
            Remember?

     She goes to the living room, double-checks the window locks
     in there.  George follows.

                               GEORGE
            Look, don't take this the wrong way, but
            don't you think you might be out of your
            league here?

                               ERIN
            No, see -- that's exactly what those
            arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that
            because they got all this money and power,
            we don't stand a chance in hell against
            them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.

     She heads into the bedrooms.

                               GEORGE
            It doesn't have to be this complicated,
            Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.

                               ERIN
                        (off-hand)
            How would you know?

     George reacts, a little stung.  He follows her into:

     INT. MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Matt and Katie are asleep.  Erin is checking their windows.
     George comes in.  They whisper.

                               GEORGE
            You mind telling me what that's supposed to
            mean?

                               ERIN
            Nothing.

                               GEORGE
            If you got a problem with me taking care of
            your kids instead of getting some job, just
            say so.

                               ERIN
            I didn't say that.

                               GEORGE
            Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can
            start leaving the kids with the chicken fat
            lady again.  Would that make you happy?

                               ERIN
            Keep your voice down.

                               GEORGE
            I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I
            probably know it better than you.

     She gives him a glare, then leaves the room.

     INT. WATER BOARD - DAY

     Erin is reaching up to a high shelf for a dusty old box of
     files.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ross passing.

                               ERIN
            Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E
            pay you to cover their ass, or do you just
            do it out of the kindness of your heart?

                               ROSS
                        (a bad liar)
            I don't know what you're talking about.

                               ERIN
            The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee.
            That heavy-breathing sicko that called the
            other night could've only found out about me
            from you.
                        (beat)
            People are dying, Ross.  You got document
            after document here, right under your nose,
            that says why, and you haven't said word one
            about it.  I wanna know how the hell you
            sleep at night.

     Ross is speechless.  He just stands there.  Erin drags the
     box to the floor and goes to work.

     EXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT

     Erin's car is parked in front.  A DIRTY OLD PICK-UP comes
     rumbling up the road.  When its lights hit Erin's car, it
     slows, then pulls over.  The driver flicks on his BRIGHTS to
     get a better look at the car.  The truck sits there for a
     bit, a dark presence.  Then, as the headlights of another car
     appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out
     and drives off.

     INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - NIGHT

     A pile of documents is strapped into the passenger seat.  An
     empty coffee cup rolls around the floor.  Erin's driving,
     exhausted.  She yawns as she dials her phone.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            Hello?

     INTERCUT between Erin in her car, and George in bed.

                               ERIN
            I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the
            road.  Keep me awake, willya?

                               GEORGE
            What do you want, a joke?

                               ERIN
            No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me
            about your day.  What went on back there?

                               GEORGE
            Well, come to think of it, we did have a big
            event around here.  Beth started talking.

                               ERIN
            What?
                        (beat)
            Beth?  My Beth?

                               GEORGE
            Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and
            she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."

     Erin says nothing, just stares out at the empty highway,
     feeling all hollowed-out.

                               GEORGE
            I'd never seen that before -- someone's
            first word.  Pretty intense.

     Erin just nods.  Keeps staring straight ahead as a tear rolls
     down her cheek.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S AREA - DAY

     CLOSE ON SOME FILES as Erin hands them to Ed.  As he takes
     them from her, he notices a crematory urn on Erin's desk.

                               ED
            Is that what I think it is?

                               ERIN
            She lived on the plume.  You never know.
         
     Ed laughs and hands the documents to Brenda without looking
     at her.  She grumpily takes them over to the fax machine.

     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED as Brenda types in the number. The
     recipient's name comes up again: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.

     EXT. HINKLEY BARBECUE - DAY

     Open pits, pony rides, watermelon.  George is watching Katie
     and Matt being led around on ponies, an activity that stopped
     being fun hours ago.  Now they're just hot and tired.

     BY THE BARBECUE, Ed is talking to an OLDER COUPLE as they
     sign retainer agreements.

     ELSEWHERE, Erin, holding Beth, is looking at pictures of a
     swimming pool with FIVE OTHER WOMEN.  The water is green.

                               ERIN
            This was the community pool?

                               WOMAN 1
            Yeah, that PG&E built.  The whole time we
            thought it was algae that made it so green.

     LATER ...

     Erin's trunk is open.  She and Ed are clipping new clusters
     of retainer agreements into the "PLAINTIFFS" binder.

     LATER STILL ...

     Erin and Ed are passing out informational pamphlets.  She
     sticks one in a hand before noticing that it's George's.

                               GEORGE
            I'm bored, and so are the kids.

                               ERIN
            Just a few more minutes, then we can go.
                        (as he heads off)
            Take her, will you?

     George drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin.  He heads
     over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log.

     As he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he
     dropped.  It belongs to a MAN IN A BLACK JACKET.  He's in his
     50's, strong and sinewy.  Military-style dark glasses obscure
     his eyes.  He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working
     the crowd.  Watches her carefully.  He slides the pamphlet
     into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the DIRTY
     OLD PICK-UP TRUCK that idled in front of the Water Board.

     LATER STILL ...

     Erin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave,
     when Donna comes up to her, with A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in tow.

                               DONNA
            Erin, this here's Frank Melendez.  He works
            over at the compressor station --

     Erin stops in her tracks, very interested.

     LATER STILL ...

     Erin and Frank are on a bench, talking.  Out of the corner of
     her eye, she sees her car drive off.  George's hand sticks
     out the driver's side and flips her the bird.  She watches
     him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank.

                               ERIN
             I'm sorry.  What were you saying?

     LATER ...

     The barbecue is winding down.  Ed is heading for his
     Mercedes.  Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out.

                               ERIN
            I need a ride.

     INT. ED'S CAR - DAY

     Ed is driving.  He glances over at Erin, fuming in the
     passenger seat.  After a beat:

                               ED
            You wanna talk about --
         
                               ERIN
            No.

     Another beat.  Then Erin's cel phone rings.  She digs into
     her bag, pulling it out as fast as she can.  Answers.

                               ERIN
            What, asshole?

     There's a pause.  Then Mike Ambrosino's voice comes over the
     line, very strained:

                               MIKE AMBROSINO (O.S.)
            Um, Erin?  This is Mike.  Ambrosino.

     EXT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY

     The curtains are drawn; everything is dark.  Ed and Erin are
     at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired.
         
                               MIKE
            She was about to take a handful of these --

     He shows them a bottle of prescription pills.

                               MIKE
            It's a morphine thing -- for pain --

     Erin nods, then leaves Ed with Mike and heads toward:

     INT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

     Erin opens the door.  Very dark, very quiet.  Laura is lying
     in bed.  Erin goes over to her.  They speak in whispers.

                               LAURA
            I'm embarrassed.

                               ERIN
            That's okay.  I understand.

                               LAURA
            It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting
            worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be
            a good mother.

                               ERIN
            I'm real sorry, Laura.

     Erin sits down on the chair next to the bed.  Takes a beat.

                               LAURA
            Know what I always thought I wanted outta
            life, Erin?  A Jaguar.

                               ERIN
            Jaguar's a darn pretty car.

                               LAURA
            I thought if I could spend that kinda money
            on a car, it'd mean everything else was
            fine.
                        (beat)
            I don't even know how much they cost.

                               ERIN
            A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll
            get one.

     Laura shakes her head.

                               LAURA
            Wouldn't mean the same thing.

     Erin watches her sadly.

     INT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY

     A LOUD, industrial plant.  Erin and Frank Melendez walk
     through, him in coveralls, her in a teensy sun dress.  Both
     in hard-hats.  He's giving her a tour.

     EXT. NORTHRIDGE STREET - DAY

     George, in his leather and denim, is walking down the
     sidewalk.  As we WIDEN, we see he's pushing a PINK STROLLER.
     He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change.

     In the stroller, Beth starts to whine.  George reaches in his
     pocket, finds her pacifier.  As he's leaning down to give it
     to her, he hears a RUMBLE coming down the street behind him.
     The roar grows.  He stands, looks.  A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN
     BIKERS has pulled up next to him.  He looks at them.  They
     look at him, then at the stroller.  George feels ridiculous.

     When the light changes, the bikers REV LOUDLY and pull out.
     George just stands there and watches them go.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT

     His office is all about Hinkley.  A map of the plume area and
     a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant
     cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface;

     Erin is up at the map, eating Chinese food.

                               ERIN
            They used the hex chrom here, in these
            cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then
            they dumped it here, in these six ponds.

                               ED
            I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.

     She bites into a forkful of food, keeps talking.

                               ERIN
            They covered 'em over.  And not too
            carefully either, cause you dig one inch
            under the surface, and the dirt is green as
            a fucking shamrock.

                               ED
            And that's what caused the contamination?

                               ERIN
            It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's
            on the bottom.

     She reaches for a document, reads from it.

                               ERIN
            See, according to this, they were supposed
            to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep
            into the ground.  But guess what --

                               ED
            They skipped that step.

                               ERIN
            I guess it was a little too inconvenient.
            So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed
            into the groundwater, free as you please.

                               ED
            Jesus.
                        (beat)
            I don't even wanna ask what you did to make
            this Melendez guy talk.

     In response to the insinuation, Erin gives him a glare.

                               ERIN
            For your information, Frank cares what was
            in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half
            his day wading around them.  That was his
            job.

                               ED
            No shit.

                               ERIN
            No --

     Suddenly, her eyes pop out of her head --

                               ERIN
            SHIT!  SHIT!  Hot!  Hot!  Hot!

     Tears spring to her eyes.  She fans furiously at her mouth.
     Ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her.
     She takes a swig.  There's a nanosecond of relief ... until
     the tequila hits.  Her eyes redden.  She spews and gasps.

                               ERIN
            You ... asshole ...

     Ed chuckles.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - LATER

     The tequila's been dipped into.  Ed and Erin are each lying
     on a couch, staring at documents.  Late-night working.

                               ED
            Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da
            put three researchers on this, I wouldn't
            expect them to dig up all the information
            you got here.  This is some damn good work.
         
                               ERIN
            Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.

                               ED
            Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I
            haven't billed a minute of my time since I
            started on this case, so you can quit
            hitting me up like I'm rich or something.

     He gets up, grabs his trash can, and moves around the room
     with it, cleaning up all the Chinese food cartons.

                               ERIN
            Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty
            rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got
            those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.

                               ED
            We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the
            balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we
            can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers
            in San Francisco.

                               ERIN
            What do you mean?

                               ED
            PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way
            of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.

                               ERIN
            Oh, they knew.  They had to know.

                               ED
            Show me the document that proves that.

     She doesn't have one.

                               ED
            Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't
            know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages.
            And punitive damages is where the money is.

                               ERIN
            Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I
            work on this thing, the more I realize what
            a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here
            we got a company that poisoned a whole
            aquifer -- that built a pool for a town,
            then filled it with toxic water -- and we're
            the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving
            things?  That's just not right.

     Beat.  Ed smiles.


                               ED
            I like this case.

                               ERIN
            Really?  It makes me sick.

                               ED
            Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a
            long time since I had a case I cared about.

                               ERIN
            You didn't care about my case?

                               ED
            I would now.

     He gives her a long look.

                               ED
            Hey.  I like working with you.

                               ERIN
            Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you
            too.

     They both smile a little awkwardly.  Take a beat.  Then:

                               ED
            When'd you start calling me Ed?

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT

     The Christmas party.  The office is decorated; someone is
     Santa.  Erin and George enter, all dressed up.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Erin's giving George a guided tour.  As they head down the
     hall, every desk is decorated and has a present on it

                               GEORGE
            I'm just saying -- we have one night to
            ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?

                               ERIN
            Cause it's my office party.  If you had an
            office, I'd go to your party.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - NIGHT

     It's dark.  The door to Erin's area opens.

                               ERIN
            And here, ta-daa, is my desk.

     She flicks on the lights.  Brenda's desk is decorated and as
     a present on it.  Erin's is empty.

                               GEORGE
            Which one?
                        (it's obvious)
            Maybe they didn't think you were coming.

     Erin shakes her head.  She's surprised by how hurt she is.

                               ERIN
                        (quietly)
            God damn.  I work so hard.  The least they
            could do ...

     George looks over at her, sees her eyes glisten a little.  He
     goes over to her, wraps his arms around her.

                               GEORGE
            Hey.  Fuck 'em, babe.  Who needs 'em, huh?

     He kisses her.  She leans into him.  He kisses her some more.

                               GEORGE
                        (quietly)
            See?  All we need is each other.

     She kisses back.  She's gonna let him take care of her.  Some
     more kisses, heating up.  He slides her onto her empty desk.

                               GEORGE
            Good thing there isn't a present there, huh?
            That mighta hurt.

     She laughs a little.  He slides his hands up her skirt.  She
     pulls him into her, tugging his shirt out of his pants.

     INT. MASRY OFFICES, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Ed is coming down the hall with his wife, JOEY.  Joey is much
     younger than Ed, and very pretty.

                               ED
            I'll show you what we did back here --

     INT. ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT

     Erin and George, in a rapidly-heating-up clinch on her desk,
     hear the voices.  Erin pulls away.

                               ERIN
            That's Ed.

                               GEORGE
            Lock the door.

                               ERIN
            No, I wanna say hi.

     He pulls her back into him, not wanting to move.

                               GEORGE
            We'll say hi later.  Lock it.

     But Erin pulls away ...

                               ERIN
            Come on, George, it's a party.

     He watches her straighten her dress and take a step away from
     him.  It's just one step, but it feels a hell a lot farther.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER

     Erin and Ed are at the reception desk, talking and laughing.

     NEARBY, Joey and George are standing together, awkwardly.

                               JOEY
            Your wife's real pretty.

                               GEORGE
            She's not my wife.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Matthew lies awake in his bed, listening to George and Erin
     fight.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            It wouldn't kill you to talk about
            something other than yourself and your own
            fucking job once in a while --

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            What do you want to talk about instead?
            Your day?  That's a fascinating subject.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Erin and George are fighting while they get ready for bed.

                               GEORGE
            Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day
            trying to prove what hot shit I am --

                               ERIN
            That is not what I'm --

                               GEORGE
            Bullshit, Erin.  Bullshit.

     The fight is interrupted by the sound of BETH CRYING.

                               ERIN
            Great.  Excellent.  Thank you very much.

     She leaves the room.

     INT. BETH'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Beth is wailing in her crib.  Erin comes in in her nightshirt
     and lifts Beth out.  Then, more to herself than to Beth:

                               ERIN
            It's okay, baby.  It'll be okay.

     She runs her hand over Beth's head, then slides down the wall
     and crumples onto the floor.  As she curls around Beth, Erin
     starts to COUGH.  Deep, raspy coughs from way down low.

     EXT. PG&E STATION - NIGHT

     Late, late at night.  The plant is silent.  The property
     seems empty, until we notice Pete Irving standing alone
     inside the gates, staring up at the station.

     After a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant.
     It misses.  Not that it would do anything if it hit.  He
     reaches for another, throws it.  Then another, and another.
     He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant.  Then,
     overwhelmed by his impotence, he lets out a TERRIFYING YELL.

     INT. IRVINGS' HOUSE, DONNA'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Donna's sitting quietly in bed.  Erin is sitting on the edge
     of the bed.

                               DONNA
            I'd got so used to having 'em come up
            benign, I guess I just didn't expect it.

     She looks down her shirt front.

                               DONNA
            Sure wish I had longer to get used to the
            idea.
                        (beat)
            You think if you got no uterus, and no
            breasts, you're still technically a woman?

                               ERIN
            Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman,
            cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads
            and underwire.

     Donna smiles a little.  Then her face crumbles.

                               DONNA
            We're gonna get them, aren't we, Erin?  You
            gotta promise me we're gonna get them.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, DAY

     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED

     as DOCUMENTS are faxed once again to the PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.

     THEN AGAIN, on another day.

     AND AGAIN, on another day.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ed is once again checking the lie of his tie in a window.
     Erin is popping some aspirin, trying to kill a headache that
     has brought with it a healthy dose of intolerance.

                               ERIN
            If they've sent that little shmuck Baum
            again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.

                               ED
            From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd
            say they're taking us more seriously.

                               ERIN
            Yeah, I heard that one before.

     Brenda leans her head in.

                               BRENDA
            Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Webster, Mr. Buda, and Ms.
            Cooper, from PG&E are here.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

     Talk about moving up the food chain.  MS. SANCHEZ, MR.
     WEBSTER, MR. BUDA, and MR. COOPER mill slowly about the
     reception area like sharks.  They all ooze importance.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE OF ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Erin, Ed and Brenda are staring out at them.

                               ERIN
            Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.

                               ED
            They're trying to intimidate us.
                        (then, to Brenda)
            Tell them to wait in the conference room.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Sanchez, Webster, Buda, and Cooper are seated.

     The door opens and Ed enters, legal pad under his arm.
     Followed by Erin, legal pad under her arm.  Followed by Anna
     (looking professional in Brenda's suit coat), legal pad under
     her arm.  Followed by Mario (in a suit produced from who
     knows where), legal pad under his arm.  If you didn't know
     better, you'd assume it was a team of lawyers as well.

                               ED
            Counselors --

                               MR. SANCHEZ
            Counselors.

     Ed and Erin sit down and get to work.  Mario and Anna,
     clearly told to just follow along, sit down a moment later.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

     Mario and Anna are sitting mutely in their seats beside Ed
     and Erin, firing blank looks across the table.

                               SANCHEZ
            Let's be honest, here.  Two million dollars
            is more money than these people have ever
            dreamed of.

     Erin has no patience for this today.

                               ERIN
            Oh, see, now that pisses me off.  First of
            all -- we got more'n a hundred plaintiffs.
            They may not be sophisticated, but they do
            know how to divide, and two million dollars
            isn't shit when it's split between them.

     Mario and Anna exchange a look.  This is getting interesting.

                               ED
            Erin --

     But there's no stopping her.

                               ERIN
            And second of all -- these people don't
            dream about being rich.  They dream about
            being able to watch their kids swim in a
            pool without worrying they'll have to have a
            hysterectomy at age 20, like Rosa Diaz -- a
            client of ours -- or have their spine
            deteriorate like Stan Bloom.  Another client
            of ours.  So before you come back here with
            another lame-ass offer, I want you to think
            real hard about what your spine is worth,
            Mr. Buda -- or what you'd expect someone to
            pay you for your uterus, Miss Sanchez --
            then you take out your calculator and
            multiply that number by a hundred.  Anything
            less than that is a waste of our time.

     And she gets up and storms out of the meeting.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY

     Erin drinks a big swig of coffee and pops a few more aspirin.
     Beyond her, the PG&E lawyers are filing out of the office.
     Anna wanders over to Erin, a little uncomfortable.

                               ANNA
            Um, Erin?
                        (Erin turns)
            Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily
            my favorite person in the world ...
                        (beat)
            ... sometimes you're not half-bad.

                               ERIN
            I'm gonna assume that was meant as a
            compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT

     Erin's at her desk, which is completely buried in documents
     and files.  She's visibly exhausted, struggling to focus on
     the page, and COUGHING while she works.  Ed calls to her.

                                ED
            Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet
            you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.

                                ERIN
            D'you get his name?
                        (no answer)
            Course not.  Jesus, Ed --

                                ED
            He said he'd be at the gas station at six.

                                ERIN
            Boy, this job takes me to some of the best
            damn places, huh?

     EXT. HINKLEY GAS STATION - SUNSET

     Erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the
     bottle.  She checks her watch: 6:30.  The GAS STATION
     ATTENDANT comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights.

                                ERIN
            This is the only station in town, right?

                               ATTENDANT
            Yup.

     He gets in his car and drives off.  Erin sits down again.
     Looks down the road in both directions.  Nothing.

     Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint
     of chrome.  She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees:
     the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery.

     Erin looks around, realizes she's alone.  As she looks back
     at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab.
     She realizes she's being watched.  The driver's door opens.

     Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys.  She
     jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it
     won't turn over.  Panic.  The Man in the Dark Glasses has
     gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around
     again.  Not a soul.  She tries the engine again.  And again.

     Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages.  Erin peels
     out of the gas station.

     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Erin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus
     on the road.  She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing.

     She reaches the train tracks.  A train is passing.  She has
     to stop.  As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce
     off her rear view mirror.  Truck lights, coming her way.
     Fuck.  She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back
     at the headlights closing in on her.  The train, the
     headlights, the train, the headlights ...

     Finally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last
     train car zips by.  Erin peels out, bounding her rickety car
     over the tracks.  The truck follows.

     EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT

     The Hyundai zips down the road.  And behind it, the truck.

     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT

     She looks out at the landscape around her.  It's black.  No
     other cars on the road.  She starts to panic, accelerates.

     EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT

     The Hyundai going faster.  The truck still following.

     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT

     Erin comes up on a stop sign.  She runs it.  So does the
     truck.   A little later, she makes a turn and sees THE LOST
     CAUSE SALOON.  In the parking lot, like a lifeboat, sits Ed's
     Mercedes.  She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car.

     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT

     Ed is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door.  She
     rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion.

                               ERIN
            Someone's following me.

                               ED
            What?  Who?

                               ERIN
            Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was
            alone, then he followed me, like, two miles.
            Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.

     Ed gets up and heads toward the door.

                               ED
                        (to the counter guy)
            Beer, please.

     As Ed looks out the door, Erin collapses onto a bench.

                               ED
            What kind of truck?

                               ERIN
            I don't know.  Big.  Dark.

                               ED
            He's gone.
                        (back to the table)
            Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?

                               ERIN
            No, Ed -- what with me running for my life,
            I didn't have time to check those things --

                               ED
            I was just asking.  Are you all right?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.

     Ed looks at her.  She looks terrible.  Shaky, tired, drawn.

                               ED
            Jesus, you look like shit.  When was the
            last time you had a decent night's sleep?

     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT

     Crappy and pink.  Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot.
     Erin's Hyundai follows.  Ed stops, gets out.

     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT

     Ed swings by Erin's open car window.

                               ED
            Don't worry.  I'm getting two rooms.

     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT

     Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each
     rattling a key.  They find their adjacent rooms and stop.
     Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand.

                               ED
            Lock the door every which way you can.  And
            if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever
            -- pound on the wall.  I'll come right over.

     She nods a little.  Then before she goes into her room:

                               ERIN
            I think you should know -- there's very few
            people in the world who don't piss me off 90
            percent of the time.
                        (beat)
            You're one of 'em.

     It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it.  They look
     at each other.  Maybe even considering.  But after a long
     beat, she reaches for her door again.  Moment over.

                               ED
            I'm triple locking my door, so don't even
            think of trying to take advantage.

     She smiles, goes inside.  He watches her close her door
     behind her before going inside himself.

     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT STOOP - NIGHT

     George is sitting alone on the stoop, drinking a beer.  Music
     is coming from his house next door.  He stares out into the
     street with a lot on his mind.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

     Katie and Matt are making a mess of breakfast.  Beth is on
     the floor, grinding cereal into the linoleum.

                             ERIN (O.S.)
            Hello?

     Erin enters, having just gotten home, and sees the mayhem.

                             ERIN
            What are you doing?  Where's George?

                             KATIE
            I don't know.

                             ERIN
            George!

     She heads out.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     George is sitting on the bed when Erin enters.

                             ERIN
            Jesus, George, they're turning the kitchen
            into a hellhole.  You know you can't leave
            them alone like that.

     He doesn't answer.  Doesn't move.  She notices this.

                             ERIN
            What's going on?  What are you doing?

                             GEORGE
            Thinking.

                               ERIN
            About what?

     He's very calm.  He holds out a small jewelry box.

                               GEORGE
            About this.

                               ERIN
            What's that?

                               GEORGE
            It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the
            mall one day, and I thought, damn, those
            would look good on those beautiful earlobes.
            So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next
            time Erin says something nice, does
            something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.
                        (beat)
            Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In
            six months, you haven't said one nice thing
            to me.  That's a long time.

                               ERIN
            I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --

                               GEORGE
            I know.  But still.  Six months.
                        (he stands)
            I think you oughta either find a different
            job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there
            may be men who don't mind being the maid and
            getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as
            shit not one of 'em.

                               ERIN
            I can't leave my job, George.

                               GEORGE
            Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People
            do it all the time.

                               ERIN
            I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best
            thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it.
            For the first time in my life, I got people
            respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a
            room and everyone shuts up just to hear what
            I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever.
            Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.

                               GEORGE
            More than you need me.

                               ERIN
            I need it.

     He nods, then stands, to leave.

                               GEORGE
            Maybe you didn't like who you were before,
            Erin, but I did.  That's who I fell in love
            with.

     Only then does she see the packed duffel bag in the corner.

                               ERIN
            You already packed up your stuff?

                               GEORGE
            I pretty much knew what your answer was
            gonna be.

     He picks it up and walks out the door, tossing the earring
     box on the bed as he goes.

     INT. ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Erin is at her window, looking out at the street below.
     George is strapping a couple of bags onto the back of his
     bike.  He gets on the bike, starts it up, and drives away.

     INT. HYUNDAI - DAY

     Erin is driving, looking weary.  Her kids are in the car.

     Matthew turns on the radio.  Erin reaches over and turns it
     off.  Matthew turns it back on.  Erin glares at him, turns it
     off.  On/off/on/off.  A test of wills.  Finally, when Matthew
     turns it on one more time, Erin turns it off, yanks the knob
     off the stereo and throws it out the window.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY

     The Hyundai pulls into the lot.

     INT. HYUNDAI - DAY

     Erin parks the car, unclips her seat belt.

                               ERIN
            Wait here.

     She gets out.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     Business as usual.  Erin comes in, goes straight to her desk.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY

     Erin flips through her "in" box, looking for something in
     particular.  Doesn't find it.  Grrr.  She heads off to:

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, JANE'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jane is at her desk when Erin comes in.

                               ERIN
            Where's my paycheck?

                               JANE
            Have you been logging on?

                               ERIN
            What?

                               JANE
            I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only
            knows to process paychecks for employees who
            log on in the morning and off at night.

                               ERIN
                        (seething)
            Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not
            in here most mornings and nights?

                               JANE
            You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of
            something.

     Erin glares at her ...

                               ERIN
            I don't believe this --

     ... then turns and storms out of Jane's office.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

     Ed is on the phone when Erin barges in, rage in her eyes.

                               ERIN
            I want my fucking money --

                               ED
                        (into phone)
            I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold
            for just one second here --
                        (puts the call on
                         hold, then, to Erin)
            Do you mind?

                               ERIN
                        (seething)
            Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.

     Clearly, she's in a dander he's going to have to deal with.

                               ED
            Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the
            problem is here, or --

                               ERIN
            It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I
            deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for.
            That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.

                               ED
            Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a
            problem with Jane, work it out for yourself.
            I don't have time to deal with --

                               ERIN
            Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass
            for you.  I watch everything else in my life
            go straight in the toilet, for you.  And
            what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the
            way I'm treated around here -- but have you
            ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever
            mentioned to everyone what good work I'm
            doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey,
            Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has
            the best tits; she gets paid the most cause
            she's the best God damn employee I've ever
            had?

                               ED
            Is that what you want?

                               ERIN
            I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.

     Ed sighs.  Realizes he's going to have to take this on.

                               ED
            I'll see what I can do.

                               ERIN
            You might want to think real hard about the
            amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God
            damn parking lot right now, cause I still
            don't make enough to afford good child care.
            Makes me think about looking around for a
            job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.

     She storms out.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Erin is standing at the sink, visibly exhausted, trying to do
     the dinner dishes with one arm and comfort Beth, who's
     CRYING, with the other.  Matthew comes in.

                               MATTHEW
            Can I play roller hockey?

                               ERIN
            We'll see.

                               MATTHEW
            When?

     The DOORBELL RINGS.  Erin goes to get it.  Matthew follows

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

     Matthew is dogging Erin on this.  Beth is still crying.

                               MATTHEW
            Randy's mom said yes right away.

                               ERIN
                        (snapping)
            Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom
            doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's
            dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's
            gonna take who where is a little easier over
            at Randy's house.

     Erin opens the door.  A MESSENGER is there.

                               MESSENGER
            Erin Brockovich?

                               ERIN
            Yeah?

                               MESSENGER
            Package from Masry & Vititoe.

     He hands her a manila envelope.  She signs for the package,
     then tears into it as the Messenger heads away.

     A CHECK and a SET OF KEYS fall out.  She looks at the check.
     It's made out for $5,000.  A note attached reads "HIRE A
     NANNY. AND LOOK OUTSIDE. - E."

     Erin looks up and sees A BRAND-NEW CHEVY BLAZER parked on the
     curb.  She looks at the keys in her hand.  Chevy keys.  Whoa.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE, PARKING LOT - DAY

     Erin drives up in the Blazer, pulls into a parking space.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, LAW LIBRARY - DAY

     It's dark.  Ed's seated at a table, alone.  Erin walks by the
     door, then spots him and stops in the doorway.

                               ERIN
            Believe it or not, I would've been satisfied
            with just the check.

     Ed turns, sees her.

                               ED
            Well, you go threatening to leave, I can't
            take any chances.  You're the only person
            around who understands what I'm doing.
            Things come up, I gotta know I got someone
            to turn to.

     She sits, reading him.

                               ERIN
            What kind of things come up?

                               ED
            Things like the head counsel for PG&E
            calling me with an offer.
                        (beat)
            20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it
            or leave it.

                               ERIN
            Whoa.  No shit.

                               ED
            It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.

                               ERIN
            So what are you thinking?

                               ED
            I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to
            make this decision.
                        (beat)
            50 thousand bucks is more than any other
            California toxic plaintiff has gotten.
            Ever.  But ...

                               ERIN
            ... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's
            medical bills.

                               ED
            And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.

                               ERIN
            Do you think we'd do better by going to
            trial?

                               ED
            Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have
            anything linking this to PG&E corporate.
            Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus,
            we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to
            bring on more lawyers ...

                               ERIN
            Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot
            of money.

                               ED
            It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight
            million dollars.

     Beat.

                               ERIN
            That's a fucking fortune, Ed.  And you know
            I'm the last person on Earth to walk away
            from a big payday.  But you and me didn't
            get into this to get rich.  We did it cause
            we both have this voice in our heads saying,
            do the right thing; get these plaintiffs
            what they deserve -- the right to live and
            die in some kind of comfort and peace.  If
            50,000 isn't gonna buy that, then we gotta
            say no.
                        (beat)
            Trust me.  If you don't do the right thing
            for these people, getting that 6 million
            dollars is gonna feel like shit.

     He nods to himself, and looks up at her, his mind made up.

                               ED
            I knew I put up with your bullshit for a
            reason.

     INT. ERIN'S NEW CAR - DAY

     It's raining.  They're driving through the tall buildings of
     Century City.  Ed is full of nervous excitement.

                               ED
            This guy, Erin -- he's got more toxic tort
            experience than anyone else in California.
            He's huge.  And he said yes to me on the
            first phone call, right off the bat.
                        (points to a building)
            That's it.  The big one.  They've got the
            top three floors.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, RECEPTION - DAY

     It feels more like the lobby of a five-star hotel than an
     office.  Erin and Ed step off the elevator.  Erin gawks.

                               ERIN
            Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?

                               ED
            Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor
            and behave yourself for once.
                        (to receptionist)
            Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

     As Ed turns to check his reflection, a YOUNG LAWYER comes
     through the reception area.  Erin watches him pass, then,
     still miffed, calls out to him.

                               ERIN
            Scuse me, sir, you got a real nice ass, you
            know that?

     The lawyer double-takes on her, then retreats into the
     office.  Erin turns to Ed, smiles.

                               ERIN
            Oh, I'm sorry.  Was that not what you meant
            by behaving myself?

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD RECEPTION AREA - DAY

     THERESA DELLAVALLE, 38, junior partner, comes out to greet
     them.  She's everything Erin isn't: conservative, restrained,
     unemotional.  And about as sexy as a station wagon.

                               THERESA
            Ed.  Good to see you again.

                               ED
            Theresa, hey -- this is Erin Brockovich.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD HALLWAY - DAY

     Theresa leads Ed and Erin down a long hall of teak desks.
     The sound of their footfalls is swallowed up by the plush
     carpeting.  Occasional ATTORNEYS and PARALEGALS glance at
     Erin.  She feels their stares.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, KURT POTTER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Potter is sitting behind his giant desk when Theresa leads Ed
     and Erin in.

                               THERESA
            Kurt, Ed Masry's here.  And this is Erin
            Brockovich, Ed's assistant.  Erin, this is
            Kurt Potter.

                               POTTER
                        (to Ed, with a wink)
            Well.  Now I know what you meant when you
            called her your secret weapon.

     Erin gives Ed another look.  What the fuck?  Ed gives her a
     firm look back.  Behave.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Potter, Ed, Erin, Theresa and few  PARALEGALS are sitting
     around the table.  As the conversation ping-pongs between Ed
     and Potter, Potter completely ignores Erin.

                               POTTER
            When'd they file the demur?

                               ED
            Yesterday.

                               ERIN
            What's a demur?

                               ED
            It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't
            have a case.  Their lawyers go --

                               POTTER
            How many counts?

                               ED
            Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all
            of 'em.

                               ERIN
            Counts?

                               ED
            Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --

                               POTTER
            Who's the judge?

                               ED
            Corey.

                               POTTER
            Good.

                               ERIN
            Why good?

                               ED
            He's got a reputation for doing all his --

                               POTTER
            How long's he gonna take?

     Erin's starting to steam at Potter.  Theresa sees it brewing,
     tries to intercede.

                               THERESA
            You know what?  Why don't I take Erin down
            the hall, so we can start in on this stuff?

     Erin notices all her files in stacks against the wall.

                               ERIN
            Hey -- those are my files --

                               THERESA
            Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And
            listen, good work.  They're a great start.
            We're just going to have to spend a little
            time filling in the holes in your research.

     Okay, these people are starting to piss her off.

                               ERIN
            Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no
            holes in my research.

                               THERESA
            No offense.  There are just some things we
            need that you probably didn't know to ask.

                               ERIN
            Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I
            may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18
            months on this case, and I know more about
            those plaintiffs than you ever will.

                               THERESA
            Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for
            some of them.

                               ERIN
            Whose number do you need?

                               THERESA
            Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to
            be able to contact the plaintiffs.

                               ERIN
            I said, whose number do you need?

                               THERESA
            You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs'
            numbers by heart.

     Erin just stares at her.  Theresa sighs, reluctantly glances
     down at a file.

                               THERESA
            Annabelle Daniels.

                               ERIN
            Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.

     As Theresa starts to write it down:

                               ERIN
            10 years old, 11 in May.  Lived on the plume
            since birth.  Wanted to be a synchronized
            swimmer, so she spent every minute she could
            in the PG&E pool.  She had a tumor in her
            brain stem detected last November, had an
            operation on Thanksgiving, shrunk it with
            radiation after that.  Her parents are Rita
            and Ted.  Ted's got Chron's disease, and
            Rita has chronic headaches and nausea and
            underwent a hysterectomy last fall.  Ted
            grew up in Hinkley.  His brother Robbie and
            his wife May and their five kids Robbie,
            Jr., Martha, Ed, Rose, and Peter lived on
            the plume too.  Their number's 454-9445.
            You want their diseases?

     Beat.  Erin glares at Theresa, indignant.

                               THERESA
            Okay, look -- I think we got off on the
            wrong foot here --

                               ERIN
            That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet.
            In fucking ugly shoes.

     INT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     It's still raining.  Erin is following Ed to the car.  He's
     furious.

                               ERIN
            She insulted me!

                               ED
            Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But
            instead of handling it politely, instead of
            treating her with respect --

                               ERIN
            Why the fuck should I respect her?

     Ed stops in his tracks, furious.  He glares at her.

                               ED
            Because that's how people treat each other!

                               ERIN
            Not in my world.

                               ED
            Gee, I wonder why.

     On that, he gets in his car, slams the door, and drives off,
     leaving her standing alone in the pouring rain.

                               ERIN
            Hey!  You're my ride!

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - DAY

     Potter and Ed are walking down the hallway, mid-conversation.
     A FEW PARALEGALS follow them with files.

                               POTTER
            I've also been thinking about the team.
            Responsibilities, who should cover what --

                               ED
            Right.

                               POTTER
            I think we should makes some changes.

     EXT. LINWOOD'S DAIRY - DAY

     Bob Linwood is in his barn, mucking it out.  Theresa is at
     the edge of the property, trying unsuccessfully to get his
     attention by yelling and waving her arms.  In her expensive
     shoes, she's stopped short of the cow patty minefield.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE ON A CLIENT FILE as a hand fills in a phone number.

     WIDEN TO SEE Erin seated with a PARALEGAL, rattling off facts
     and numbers from memory.  She's seized by a COUGHING FIT.

     EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY - DAY

     Theresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention.  Finally,
     rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses
     it at the barn.  It hits the window and BREAKS IT.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - DAY

     Erin's desk is empty: no Erin, no files, nothing.  Ed comes
     out of his office and hands Brenda a STACK OF DOCUMENTS.

     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED

     Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up
     again, only this time it says: POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD.

     INT. POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY

     A SECRETARY carries the documents to Potter's office.  On the
     way, she passes THE CONFERENCE ROOM.  Inside, Erin is still
     dictating to the PARALEGAL.  She's shivery with fever now.
     The floor around her is littered with tissues.

     INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY

     Theresa is talking to Rita and Ted Daniels.  Annabelle is
     curled up on the sofa, wrapped up in a blanket.  Rita and Ted
     notice that Theresa doesn't even look at Annabelle.

     INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DAY

     Erin is lying in bed, home sick, talking on the phone.  She's
     talking over the noise of TANIA, her 20-something Eastern
     European nanny, vacuuming the hall.

                               ERIN
            I know she isn't real warm, but they say
            she's a real good lawyer ...

     INTERCUT WITH

     INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY

     Ted Daniels is on the phone.  Rita is next to him.

                               TED
            That may be.  But I don't want her coming to
            the house again.  She's kinda stuck-up, and
            she upsets Annabelle.  Now, I hate to say
            this, but when she left today, Rita asked if
            we should get a new lawyer.

                               ERIN
            Ted, no -- don't do that.  If you don't like
            Theresa, you don't have to work with her.
            Me and Ed are still here for you.

                               TED
            I called Ed two days ago, Erin, and he still
            hasn't called me back.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY

     The phone rings.  Brenda picks up.

                               BRENDA
            Ed Masry's office ... Sorry, he can't be
            interrupted.

     INTERCUT WITH Erin at home, still in bed, so irritated.

                               ERIN
            Don't be a pain in the ass, okay, Brenda?
            Just put him on.

                               BRENDA
                        (with finality)
            I said, he can't be interrupted.

     Erin hangs up.  Then, with a groan, she pulls her weary body
     out of bed.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY

     Erin drags herself into the office.

                               ROSALIND
            Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick
            day.

                               ERIN
            So did I.

     She heads toward Ed's office, but stops when she sees a
     meeting in progress in the conference room.  Ed is on the
     side of the table facing her, flanked by Potter and Theresa.
     On the other side of the table, are FOUR SUITED BACKS.

                               ERIN
            What's going on in there?

                               ROSALIND
            Some meeting.  With PG&E people.

                               ERIN
            PG& -- Are you sure?

                               ROSALIND
            Yup.  They must be important, too, cause
            they came on a special plane.

     Erin feels this like a sock in the gut.  She stares at the
     meeting, stunned.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     This band of PG&E lawyers is the oldest and most impressive
     of all.  Ed, Potter, and Theresa are listening to the most
     senior PG&E lawyer, MR. CORBIN, talk.

                               CORBIN
            ... we would enter into binding arbitration
            -- judge, no jury -- with a settlement to be
            between 50 and 400 million dollars.

     Ed and Potter hear this and think about it.

                               POTTER
            Any preconditions on the settlements?

                               CORBIN
            The plaintiffs have to agree to it
            unanimously.  And they're barred from ever
            discussing their settlement with anyone.

                               ED
            50-400 million dollars isn't a whole hell of
            a lot of money for your company, Mr. Corbin.

                               HEAD COUNSEL
            50-400 million dollars is a great deal of
            money for your plaintiffs, Mr. Masry.

     As Ed mulls this, he sees, beyond Mr. Corbin,

     ERIN

     staring at him from the other side of the glass wall, her
     face cold with hurt and anger.

                               ED
            Could I -- just take a brief break here for
            a moment?  I'll be right back.

     He gets up and goes out into:

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     Ed comes out.  Erin's so angry she can barely breathe.

                               ERIN
            If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your
            fucking head off --

                               ED
            Erin, it's just a meeting.

                               ERIN
            People don't fly down in their own god damn
            plane for "just a meeting" --

                               ED
            Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I
            thought you should rest.

                               ERIN
            Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if
            it suited you.

                               ED
            Okay, look.  It's an important meeting.
            Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --

                               ERIN
            Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think
            anymore?

     He resists being dragged into an knock-down, drag-out fight.

                               ED
            Look, this is serious now.  They're talking
            serious money --

                               ERIN
            And, what, I'm not serious?

                               ED
            You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say
            any God damn thing that comes into your
            head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That
            can be great; that can be a lot of fun --

                               ERIN
            "Fun?"  Jesus, "fun?"  I kill myself for a
            year and a half, hand you the best case of
            your life on a God damn silver platter,
            remind you of why you became a lawyer in the
            first place, and you think of me as "fun?"

                               ED
            Okay, now you're making this personal, and
            it isn't --

                               ERIN
            Not personal?  That's my work in there, Ed.
            My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not
            personal, I don't know what is.

     She starts to COUGH and CRUMBLE, but fights it.

                               ERIN
                        (weakened)
            How dare you take that away from me.

                               ED
            No one's taking anything --

                               ERIN
            Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating
            to some God damn steno clerk so you could
            finish this thing without me.  After all
            I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.

     By now the entire office is watching.  As are the lawyers in
     the conference room.

                               ED
            Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty.
            You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of
            perks ...

                               ERIN
            Perks?  Jesus -- perks?

     Erin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone.

                               ERIN
            If this piece of shit is supposed to take
            the place of your respect, you can take it
            and shove it up your ass.

     She throws it at him and storms away.  The phone hits the
     glass wall of the conference room, CRACKING it.  Ed just
     stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the
     splintered glass wall.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY

     Erin gets to her car.  As she opens the door, the ALARM
     SOUNDS.  She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it
     off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out.  With the
     siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage.

     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Erin's driving home.  As she turns onto her street, her
     headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small
     boy, wearing a backpack, walking the other way.

                               ERIN
            Holy shit --

     She looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark.
     She pulls a U-turn in the middle of the street.  A CAR HONKS.

     Erin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again.  Holy shit,
     is right.  It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night.

                               ERIN
            Matthew --

     She pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk,
     blocking his path.  When he sees her car, he turns and runs
     the other way.  Erin leaps out and follows him.

                               ERIN
            Matthew!  MATTHEW!

     She catches up and collars him.

                               ERIN
            God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you
            doing out here?

                               MATTHEW
            I'm gonna go live with George.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     MUSIC is playing.  TANIA is on the phone.  The receiver is
     yanked from her hand.  She turns to see Erin hovering over
     her, barely containing herself.

                               ERIN
            If you leave here real fast, I might not
            kill you.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATTHEW AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Matthew's in his bed, facing the wall.  Erin sitting on the
     foot of his bed, near tears.  Katie's watching from her bed.

                               ERIN
            We'll work out the roller hockey thing,
            okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out.
            I promise.

                               MATTHEW
            You always say that.  Then you go to work
            and forget you promised.

                               ERIN
            I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard.
            It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to
            be able to organize things right and -- when
            it comes to you guys, I end up falling
            short.

                               MATTHEW
            You never fall short for the work people.  I
            guess maybe you just love them more.

                               ERIN
            Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on
            Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.
                        (beat)
            I promise.

     She lays her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off and
     inches away from her.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Erin comes out of the bedroom.  As she turns to close the
     door, she collapses to the floor in a heap.  Out cold.

     INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

     A busy Southland ER.  George bursts through the doors with
     Katie, Matthew and Beth in tow.  He goes up to the desk.

                               GEORGE
            I'm looking for Erin Brockovich.  They
            brought her in in an ambulance?

     INT. ER WAITING AREA - DAY

     The kids are waiting.  George is talking to a DOCTOR.

                               GEORGE
            Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?

                               DOCTOR
            It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and
            part of the brain.

                               GEORGE
            Jesus.

                               DOCTOR
            She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a
            pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been
            walking around with it for a few weeks now.

                               GEORGE
            How does someone get meningitis?

                               DOCTOR
            Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to
            bacteria or a virus or ...

                               GEORGE
            ... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     Matt and Katie sit on the cheap plastic chairs outside the
     room.  Katie is holding Beth, who's sleeping.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            They can stay at my place till you go home.

     INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     Erin's in bed, hooked up to an IV, looking exhausted.  All
     untouched food tray is beside her bed.  George is standing
     across the room from her, arms crossed tight across his
     chest, keeping his distance.

                               ERIN
            They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just
            wanna keep an eye on me another night.

                               GEORGE
            Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.

     A moment of thick silence.

                               ERIN
            Thank you.

                               GEORGE
                        (giving nothing)
            Mm-hm.

     As she watches him reach for his motorcycle helmet, to leave,
     she's hit with a wave of regret.

                               ERIN
            George, hang on.
                        (he pauses)
            Look ... I'm sorry.  I just --

     There's a KNOCK at the door, and Ed enters.  George looks at
     him.  Not interested in her apologies.

                               GEORGE
            I'll drop 'em by tomorrow.

     And Erin watches George leave the room, then turns to Ed.

                               ERIN
            If you're here to fire me, your timing's
            lousy.

                               ED
            I'm not gonna fire you.
                        (beat)
            I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and
            that woulda made me look like a shit.
                        (serious)
            You embarrassed me, Erin.

                               ERIN
            I know.  I'm sorry.
                        (beat)
            Do I get to hear what happened anyway?

     INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

     Ed has taken off his coat and pulled a chair up next to
     Erin's bed.  He's eating the pudding off her tray.

                               ERIN
            Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?

                               ED
            Uh-huh.

                               ERIN
            And if you had to guess ...

                               ED
            With nothing linking it to the corporate
            offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the
            lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.

                               ERIN
            So why would PG&E offer it?

                               ED
            Because.  They know the evidence; they know
            they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they
            wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once
            you factor in all they'd spend on this case
            in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --

                               ERIN
            Wait, what do you mean, ten years?

                               ED
            Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that
            for the appeal.

                               ERIN
                        (confused)
            I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing
            goes to trial, it'll be ten years before
            these plaintiffs see their money?

                               ED
            Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the
            Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and
            those people still haven't seen a dime.  So
            in legal terms, ten years is --

                               ERIN
            Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human
            beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of
            them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They
            need their money now!
                        (beat)
            We gotta get 'em to agree to the
            arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn
            one of those plaintiffs to --

                               ED
            I know.  We're having a meeting, it's all
            set up --

                               ERIN
            When?  Where?

                               ED
            Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.

                               ERIN
            Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to
            tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --

                               ED
            You're not gonna be there.

                               ERIN
            The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the
            doctor says --

                               ED
            This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm
            saying you can't come.

                               ERIN
            Why not?

                               ED
            Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you.
            He thinks you're a loose cannon.

                               ERIN
            Fuck Kurt.

                               ED
            Erin --

                               ERIN
            No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter
            is?  He's the kind of guy who never would
            have taken this case in the first place.
            He's the kind of guy who would have sold
            these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E
            offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like
            us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head
            telling him to do the right thing.

     But his mind's made up.  He stands to leave.

                               ED
            Don't come, Erin.  I mean it.  If you do,
            I'm gonna have to fire you.
                        (beat)
            Just ... concentrate on getting well.

     EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The parking lot is empty, except for three Mercedes.  Ed,
     Potter, and Theresa are in the doorway, going over their
     notes.  A TRUCK pulls into the lot.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

     Katie and Matt are watching TV.  Beth is playing near them.
     Behind them, Erin is lying on the couch, under a blanket,
     distractedly trying to watch TV.  She checks her watch.

     EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The lot is filling with more cars and trucks; headlights
     criss-cross each other as people pull in from all directions.

     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin's sitting up now, jiggling her knee, unable to sit
     still.  She checks her watch again.  6:30.  She can't take
     it.  She throws off the blanket and gets up.

                               ERIN
            Come on, kids, we're going for a ride.

     INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON HANDS.  As people stream in, they are each handed a
     release form with a space for a signature on the bottom.

     INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - LATER

     It's sweltering.  The room, packed with plaintiffs, hums with
     horse flies and tension.  People are fanning themselves with
     the release forms.  Potter's addressing them from a raised
     platform.  Ed, Theresa, and Andrew are seated behind him.

                               POTTER
            Binding arbitration isn't all that different
            from a trial.  It's overseen by a judge.
            Evidence is presented in much the same way.

     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     One more car pulls into the lot.  It's Erin's Chevy.

     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Erin unbuckles her seat belt.

                               ERIN
            Stay in the car, babies, I won't be long.

     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin gets out of the car, looks around, then goes over to a
     window and looks in at the packed meeting.

                               PLAINTIFF (O.S.)
            And then a jury decides?

                               POTTER (O.S.)
            No, sorry, I should have mentioned that.
            There's no jury in binding arbitration.  No
            jury, and no appeal.

     She climbs up on an old wagon for a better view.

                               BOB LINWOOD (O.S.)
            No appeal?  So what are our options if we
            don't like the result?

                               POTTER (O.S.)
            Well -- you have none.  The judge's decision
            is final.  But I really don't anticipate
            that as a problem.

     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Now, in addition to the stifling heat, the large room is
     thick with mistrust.  People are shifting in their seats,
     whispering to each other.

                               TOM BROWN
            You don't even know what it's gonna be; how
            do you know we're gonna like it?

     Agreeing MURMURS ripple through the crowd.

                               POTTER
            As I said before, it will definitely be
            somewhere between 50 and 400 million
            dollars.

                               MANDY BROWN
            Which?  There's a big difference there.

                               POTTER
            I wouldn't want to speculate at this point.

                               MANDY BROWN
            Ed -- what do you think it'll be?

     Potter turns around and looks at Ed seated behind him.

                               ED
            I think ... Kurt's right.  We shouldn't
            speculate.

                               MANDY BROWN
            So then, what, that mystery number's divided
            up at the whim of some judge --

                               POTTER
            Judges don't make decisions based on whim,
            ma'am.  They make them based on precedent
            and evidence.

     The GRUMBLE of discontent has overtaken the room.  More
     whispering, more movement.

     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Erin watches the meeting fall apart.  It's driving her crazy.

                               ERIN
            Fucking idiot --

     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Potter sees he's losing them, too.  Tries to gain control.

                               POTTER
            Look.  Everyone.  Is this a big decision?
            Absolutely.  But I do believe that if you
            put a little faith in the system, you'll be
            quite pleased with the outcome.

     Ted Daniels gets up from his seat.

                               TED DANIELS
            Mr. Potter, if you knew me from Adam, you'd
            know that being pleased isn't an option for
            me anymore.  Now don't take this personally,
            sir, but I've never seen you before in my
            life.  I'm not about to put my faith in
            anything just cause you tell me to.

     He drops his agreement form, unsigned, then takes Rita's hand
     and heads for the door.

     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Meeting's over.  The plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse.
     Cars start up, headlights flick on.  People pull away.

     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

     Everyone has left.  Erin enters and looks around.  The floor
     is littered with rejected, unsigned release forms.

     She thinks for a moment, then gets an idea.  She picks up a
     release form, and leaves the firehouse.

     EXT. MINI MALL - NIGHT

     Everything's closed, except the KINKO'S store at the far end.
     Erin's truck pulls into the parking lot.

     INT. KINKO'S - NIGHT

     A BORED EMPLOYEE is at the register, painting with Wite-Out
     on a blue piece of paper.  Erin enters, dragging her kids.

                               ERIN
            Can I have one of those counter thingies,
            please?

     The Employee gives it to her.  Erin crosses to the copiers.
     She slips the release form into one, then taps in the number
     of copies: 635.  Presses "START."  The machine WHIRS to life.

     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT

     Erin's Chevy pulls into the parking lot.

                              MATTHEW (O.S.)
            I don't want to stay here.  It smells.

     INT. HINKLEY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Erin is entering the crappy motel room with her kids.

                               ERIN
            We got no choice.  I'm not gonna make it
            home tonight.  Now go wash up and climb into
            bed.

     As the kids wander toward the bathroom, Erin picks up the
     phone and dials.  RING, RING.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            Hello?

                               ERIN
            Hi.  It's me.
                        (silence)
            I got a favor to ask you.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            I don't do favors for you anymore.

                               ERIN
            It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're
            the only one I trust them with.

     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - DAY

     Very early.  Erin is visible in the motel office, talking to
     the clerk, when George's motorcycle pulls into the lot.  She
     turns around and sees him pulling up next to her Chevy.

     EXT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     Erin comes up to him, hands him a key.

                               ERIN
            I got you your own room.

     He takes it, glances toward the motel room.

                               GEORGE
            They up?

                               ERIN
            Hunh-uh.  Not yet.
                        (awkward beat)
            Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike,
            okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.

     She hands him a wad of cash.

                               GEORGE
            How long's this whole thing gonna take?

                               ERIN
            I don't know.  Few days.
                        (beat)
            Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.

     He nods.  She gets into her car.  Before closing the door,
     she turns back to him.

                               ERIN
            And I miss you.

                               GEORGE
            Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.

     She sees how mad she's made him.  Takes a beat.

                               ERIN
            I treated you real bad, George.  I know
            that.  But, my problem was -- I never been
            with anyone who deserved better than that.
            You're the first nice guy who ever liked me.

     George softens, shifts.  He steps toward the truck and gently
     closes her door, so he's standing close to her.

                               ERIN
            I just ... didn't know how to handle it.
            That's all.

     He thinks about this.  Finally:

                               GEORGE
            Think you could learn?

                               ERIN
                        (with a smile)
            You know me.  I pick things up real fast.

     He smiles back at her, nods, then tenderly brushes a piece of
     hair out of her eyes.

                               GEORGE
            You shouldn't be driving around, you know.
            You're sick.

                               ERIN
            Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of
            these folks aren't.

     He nods, understanding.  Then he taps the side of her truck
     and turns toward the motel room.  She puts the truck in gear
     and pulls out.

     EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - DAY

     Erin's Chevy is bombing down the road.

     INT. ERIN'S CAR, BACK SEAT - DAY

     There are two boxes there -- one full of unsigned release
     forms, the other empty.

     EXT. DONNA'S NEW HOUSE - DAY

     Donna's gardening out front, her head wrapped in a scarf to
     cover her chemo-thinning hair, when Erin's Chevy pulls into
     the driveway.  Erin gets out, goes to the back of the truck,
     gets two of the release forms, then heads over to Donna.

     INT. DONNA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Erin is sitting with Pete and Donna.

                               DONNA
            I don't know, Erin -- the way he was talking
            to us, telling us everything was gonna be
            fine -- I just didn't trust him.

                               PETE
            And after all we been through -- no jury, no
            appeal.  It just makes me nervous.

                               ERIN
            I understand all that. And I don't wanna
            force you into anything.  If you don't want
            to sign, that's fine.  But why don't we talk
            it over a little, cause I'd sure hate for
            you to turn this down for the wrong reasons.

     EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY

     The door opens.  Erin emerges, holding two signed agreements.
     Donna is letting her out.

                               ERIN
            You wouldn't happen to have a little time
            right now, would you, Donna?

                               DONNA
            For what?

                               ERIN
            Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns
            now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values
            your opinion ...

     INT. MANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Erin, Donna, Mandy, and Tom are seated on the sofas.  Mandy
     signs an agreement.  Hands the pen to Tom, who also signs.

     EXT. LINWOODS' HOUSE - DAY

     From outside, we see Erin at the kitchen table with Donna and
     Bob and Ruth Linwood, who are listening intently.

     INT. DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY

     Erin and Donna are leaving, saying good-bye to Mary DeSoto.
     Erin has a signed release form in her hand.

     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S CAR - DAY

     DISCO blares.  The two boxes.  The formerly empty one now has
     a small stack of signed release forms in it.  The top one has
     Bob Linwood's signature.

     IN THE FRONT SEAT

     Erin is driving, eating a hamburger, and going over her list
     of plaintiffs.

     EXT. HINKLEY MART - EVENING

     People are going about their shopping.  Rita Daniels is
     stopped, talking with A FEW MORE PLAINTIFFS.

                               RITA
            I thought so, too, but Erin says a trial's
            gonna take years

     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT

     The signed stack has grown; the unsigned stack has shrunk.
     Erin drops five more agreements into the "signed" box.

     INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     In the wee hours.  While her kids sleep, Erin sits at the
     cheap motel room table, going through her forms, organizing,
     alphabetizing.

     INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE ON ERIN, fast asleep at the table, her face pressed
     against the linoleum.  There's some NOISE in the room,
     WHISPERING.  Erin stirs and looks around to see George behind
     her, diapering Beth, while Matt and Katie put their shoes on.

                               ERIN
            What time is it?

                               GEORGE
            Real early.  We're just gonna take your car
            to get some breakfast.

     Erin forces herself awake.

                               ERIN
            No, I need my car --

                               GEORGE
            We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more
            sleep.

     He picks up Beth, takes Katie's hand, and calls across the
     room to Matthew.

                               GEORGE
            C'mon, pal.  Leave that alone, we gotta go.

     Erin turns to see Matthew holding one of her release forms.

                               ERIN
            Oh, baby, please don't play with that, okay?
            I got 'em all organized.  Just put it back.

     But he's reading it.  And something has caught his attention.
     He looks up at Erin.

                               MATTHEW
            This girl's the same age as me.

     Erin gently takes the form away from Matthew, wanting to
     shield him from the harsh realities of this case.

                               ERIN
            That's right, sweetheart.

     She replaces the form on top of the stack.

                               MATTHEW
            She's one of the sick people?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  She is.
                        (beat)
            But you know what?  That's why I'm helping
            her.  So she can get some medicine to make
            her feel better.

     Matthew mulls this over a bit more.

                               MATTHEW
            How come her own mom isn't helping her?

                               ERIN
            Cause her own mom's real sick, too.

     Matthew thinks real hard about this, then heads over to the
     door, where George, Beth, and Katie are waiting for him.
     Before he leaves, though, he turns back to Erin.

                               MATTHEW
            Maybe we'll bring you back some breakfast.
            You want eggs?

     She looks at the group of them, feels their shift toward
     acceptance.  Smiles, moved.

                               ERIN
            Eggs'd be great, baby.  Eggs'd be perfect.

     INT. ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

     Erin's driving along a dusty Hinkley road, eating cold eggs
     out of a take-out container with her fingers.

     EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY

     Morning.  A GROUP OF MEN are arriving at work.  Erin's truck
     pulls up.  She grabs some release forms from the truck and
     wanders up to the men.

                               ERIN
            Hey, y'all.  How you all doing today?

     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

     She tosses eight more agreements in the signed stack.

     EXT. HINKLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

     Morning drop-off time.  Erin is handing out release forms zo
     a GROUP of MOTHERS who just dropped off their kids.

     EXT. HINKLEY MART - NIGHT

     Erin is leaning on the hood of her truck, going down her list
     of plaintiffs, checking off the ones who have already signed.

     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - DAY

     Another day.  Erin has set up shop here and is at a table
     with about FIVE PLAINTIFFS, all reading agreements.  MIKE
     AMBROSINO enters.  Erin spots him.

                               ERIN
            Mike!  I been looking all over for you.
            Come here, I wanna talk to you.

     INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT

     The signed stack is getting bigger.

     INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

     And bigger.

     INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

     And still bigger.

     EXT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT

     CLOSE ON ERIN'S TRUNK.  A bunch more forms get thrown onto
     the signed stack, which is now much higher than the unsigned.

                               ERIN (O.S.)
            I'm gonna head out to Barstow and talk to
            some folks out there tonight.

     WIDEN TO REVEAL Erin talking on a nearby pay phone.

                               GEORGE (O.S.)
            Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.

                               ERIN
            I will.  Bye.

     She hangs up.  As she turns to get into her car, she finds
     herself face-to-face with the Man in the Dark Glasses.

                               ERIN
            Jesus!

     He's just standing there, a foot away, blocking her exit.
     She recognizes his truck as the one that chased her.

                               ERIN
            Okay, what're you gonna do?  You gonna kill
            me?  Dump my body in a ditch somewhere?  Or
            maybe you just wanna inject me with some
            poison too -- why change tactics at this
            stage of the game?
                        (beat)
            Get outta my way, you make me sick.

     She pushes past him.  But he grabs her by the arm.  He's a
     big guy; it's a strong grab.  Now she's scared.  For a
     moment, he does nothing.  Just looks at her.  Then:

                               DARK GLASSES
            If PG&E made someone destroy a whole lot of
            documents -- would that matter to you?

     Erin takes a beat, realizing she completely misread him.  She
     gently pulls her arm away.

                               ERIN
            Well ... I guess that depends on what the
            documents were.
                        (she takes a beat)
            I'm sorry -- I didn't get your name.

                               DARK GLASSES
            Embry.  Charles Embry.

     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT

     Erin and Embry are the only patrons.  Erin's eating a burger.
     Embry has a beer.  He's talking quietly, not looking at her.

                               EMBRY
            I was working in the compressor, and out of
            nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the
            office and says, we're gonna give you a
            shredder machine, and send you on down to
            the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of
            all the documents stored out there.

                               ERIN
            Did he say why?

                               EMBRY
            Nope.  And I didn't ask.

                               ERIN
            Did you get a look at the stuff you
            destroyed?

                               EMBRY
            Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding --
            you gotta find some way to entertain your
            mind.  So yeah, I took a look.

                               ERIN
            And ...?

                               EMBRY
            There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation
            schedules, the like.
                        (beat)
            But then there were a few memos about the
            holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had
            readings from test wells, stuff like that.

     Erin tries to hide her excitement at this information.

                               ERIN
            And you were told to destroy those?

                               EMBRY
            That's right.

     Destruction of evidence.  Pretty big deal.  Erin plays it
     down.  Wipes her mouth with her napkin, takes a sip of beer.

                               EMBRY
            Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good
            employee.

                               ERIN
            What do you mean?

                               EMBRY
            Well.  There were a few documents that I
            somehow didn't get around to shredding.
                        (beat)
            That I kept instead.

     Erin stops, mid-bite.

     INT. EMBRY'S GARAGE - NIGHT

     He's dug out an inch-high stack of documents.  Erin looks
     them over, stunned.  Embry is standing apart from her, hands
     shoved deep in his pockets.

                               ERIN
            How come you didn't say anything when you
            found these things?

                               EMBRY
            At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some
            of 'em want to go to college.  I can't
            afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was
            being honorable.
                        (beat)
            But there's nothing honorable in what I did.
                        (beat)
            Maybe that's why they picked me for the job.
            Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

     Rosalind is at the desk.  Anna, Brenda, and Jane are helping
     themselves to coffee.  Erin enters, with a big box in her
     arms and a whole lot of attitude.

                               ERIN
            Hey, Ros, where are they?

                               ROSALIND
            In the conference --

     But Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can
     finish.  Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her
     gait.  They watch her with interest.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     The table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated
     slew of paper that PG&E is sending them.  Ed, Kurt, Theresa,
     Andrew and ABOUT FIVE PARALEGALS are sifting through them.

     Erin breezes in like sunshine.

                               ERIN
            Morning!

                               ED
            Erin?  What are you --

                               ERIN
                        (ignoring Ed)
            You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely
            forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing
            as how you've been so good to me, I think
            that is a terrible oversight.  So what I
            been doing over the last few days is I've
            been putting together a present for you.

     She plunks the box down on the table.  Potter opens the top
     of the box.  Looks in.

                               ERIN
            635.  They all signed.  Every single one.

     IN THE DOORWAY, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering
     what's up.  A huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads
     across Ed's face.

                               ED
            Ho - ly - shit.

                               ERIN
            Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a
            little something for you, too.

     Erin hands Ed a manila envelope.  He opens it.

                               ERIN
            Internal PG&E documents, all about the
            contamination.  The one I like best says,
            and I'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes,
            the water's poisonous, but it'd be better
            for all involved if this matter wasn't
            discussed with the neighbors.  It's to the
            Hinkley station, from PG&E Headquarters.
            Stamped received, March, 1966.

     Potter and Theresa reel.  Ed shakes his head in disbelief.

                               POTTER
            Where did -- how did you do this?

                               ERIN
            Well, what with me not having any brains or
            legal expertise, I just went on up there and
            performed sexual favors.  635 blow jobs in
            five days.  Whew, am I ever tired.

     And she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed.
     The CLIP CLIP CLIP of her heels carry her away.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

     Erin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads
     down the hall.  She presses the elevator button.  The doors
     open.  As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office.

                               ED
            Hey!

     Erin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing.  He
     stares at her, in awe.

                               ED
            I don't know what to say.

                               ERIN
            Say you were wrong.

                               ED
            I was wrong.

                               ERIN
            Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged
            yourself.

                               ED
            I did.  Both.

                               ERIN
            Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on
            Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.

                               ED
            The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe,
            Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in
            history.

     He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in
     the elevator.  He walks toward her, stops right outside the
     elevator.

                               ED
            But I know you're not gonna quit on me.

                               ERIN
            How do you know that?

                               ED
                        (with a smile)
            Cause you got a little voice in your head
            saying, do the right thing.  Give him
            another chance.

     Of course she will.  She releases her hand so he won't see
     her smiling.  Ed watches the doors close.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. PCH - DAY

     One of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball.

     Erin's Chevy moves up the PCH.  DISCO music emanates from it.

     INT. ERIN'S CHEVY - DAY

     Erin's at the wheel.  Time has passed -- her hair's a little
     different.  She's singing along with "Funky Town."

     EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - DAY

     Erin gets out of her new truck, looks, sees the Irvings in a
     little cluster.  Donna's under an umbrella.  Pete is
     slathering on sunscreen.  The two girls zip out toward the
     water.  Erin waves.  Pete and Donna spot her, wave back.

     EXT. BEACH - LATER

     Donna is standing at the edge of the water, watching her
     girls boogie board in.  Erin comes up behind her.

                               ERIN
            How you feeling today?

     Donna turns, sees her.  Smiles.

                               DONNA
            It's a good day.  I feel good.

                               ERIN
            Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it,
            maybe we should talk shop.

     Erin sits down on a rock.

                               ERIN
            The judge came up with a number.

                               DONNA
            A number for the whole group, or for us?

                               ERIN
            Both.

     Donna sits down next to her.

                               ERIN
            He's making them pay the maximum.

     Tears of vindication spring to Donna's eyes.

                               DONNA
            Oh, my God.

                               ERIN
            And he's making them give five million of it
            to you all.

                               DONNA
            Five million dollars?

                               ERIN
            Five million dollars.

     She reels.  After a breathless beat:

                               DONNA
            I don't even know how much money that is.

                               ERIN
            It's enough -- for whatever you need, for
            whatever your girls need, for whatever your
            girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.

     Donna wipes the tears off her face, then watches the light
     flickering off her girls playing in the surf.

                               DONNA
            I can put them in a good school.

                               ERIN
            Any school you want.

                               DONNA
            And get someone to help around the house.

                               ERIN
            Yup.

                               DONNA
            Oh my God.  Oh my God.

     Donna is overwhelmed.  Erin pulls her close.

                               DONNA
            Oh, my God.

     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

     Now this is where the hot lawyers work.  A gleaming testament
     to power.

     INT. MASRY & VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

     Boxes everywhere.  They just moved in.  Everyone is unpacking
     at his or her desk.  Rosalind is manning the new phones.

                               ROSALIND
            Masry & Vititoe, can I -- shoot!

     She lost them.  Her reaction indicates this isn't the first
     time.  The front doors open and Erin enters.

                               ERIN
            Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?

                               ROSALIND
            Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.
                        (into phone)
            Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.
                        (calling out)
            Does anyone know anything about these
            phones?

     Erin heads on down a hall to:

     INT. ED'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

     A beautiful corner office.  Ed is unpacking when Erin enters.

                               ERIN
            Careful you don't spit from here; you could
            kill someone.

                               ED
            You see your office?

                               ERIN
            Yeah.  Yours is nicer.

                               ED
            Oh, okay.  Here it comes.

                               ERIN
            Here what comes?

                               ED
            The extortion, the threats ...

                               ERIN
            I wasn't gonna --

                               ED
            "I can always find someplace else to work.
            Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give
            me a view of the French Riviera ..."

                               ERIN
            Ed, I swear, I'm not --

                               ED
            Okay, fine.  Fine  You backed me into a
            corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...

     He reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a check.  Hands
     it to her.

                               ERIN
            What is that?

                               ED
            Take it.

     Erin does.  Looks at it.  Her eyes bug out.

                               ERIN
            Two million dollars?

                               ED
            The firm took in sixty.  That's three
            percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.

     She stares at it, speechless.  He goes back to unpacking

                               ED
            Oh, now I suppose you're gonna say it's not
            enough.  Well, tough, Erin.  Too goddamn
            bad.  Cause this is absolutely, positively
            where I draw the line.

                                                  FADE OUT.

                               THE END

                         BEGIN CREDITS:

          EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY

          An idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in
          front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with
          flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We
          see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a
          company of about 50 - 75 employees.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY

          We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line
          production. It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge
          vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring
          products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc. It has a
          high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big
          windows overlooking this manufacturing area.
          We PAN up to the main office.

          INSIDE THE OFFICE
          JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the
          phone with his friend DEAN.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          You should come by tonight. Half
          price well drinks while the game's
          going.

                         JOEL
          You always give me free drinks
          though.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          Oh yeah. Well come by anyway.

                         JOEL
          Yeah?... Might as well. No action
          going on at my house, that's for
          sure.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          Really? The wife out of town?

                         JOEL
          No... I just haven't been laid in
          a month.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          DEAN (v.o.)
          You guys having problems or
          something?

                         JOEL
          No. This is pretty much normal
          these days...
          As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the
          manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down
          through various stages of assembly line production, then
          follows several bottles of orange extract moving past
          HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The
          camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short,
          beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and
          mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he
          says sound as macho and important as possible.

                         STEP
          You get this job through Manpower?

                         HECTOR
          Yeah.

                         STEP
          I started here with Manpower too.
          Started out on the line just like
          you.

                         (DEAD-SERIOUS)
           Only I did better... 40 crates a
          day. 
          Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about.
          STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only
          polite reaction would be one of total amazement.

                         STEP (CONT'D)
          I'm the best sorter in here.
          That's why they made me full time
          with benefits. I'll probably be
          floor manager this year.
          A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with
          too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail,
          lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of
          pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought
          to be out of style by now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun. He
          flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each
          application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping
          each box when he's done, generally making the activity look
          like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step
          and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets.

                         RORY
          (hands them each a flier)
          My band's playing this Friday, come
          check us out.
          Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties
          clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, "God's
          Cock". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much
          English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the
          flier.
          AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets,
          sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-
          wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack,
          and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear-
          shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always
          shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a
          clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her
          head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her
          forties.

                         MARY
          You see that... That new guy.
          He's holding us up. It's not my
          job to tell them to hold the line
          either.

                         GABRIELLA
          And then Joel's gonna come yell at
          us, cuz he's not doing his job.

                         MARY
          (folds her arms, fed up)
          I'm just gonna sit here.

                         GABRIELLA
          You're not gonna shut it off?

                         MARY
          I'm not gonna hold the line. If
          they're not gonna do their job, why
          should I do mine.
          Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause
          the conveyor belt.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel is still on the phone with Dean.

                         JOEL
          If I don't get home before about
          8:00, she puts on the sweatpants
          and once the sweatpants are on,
          it's over -- I get nothing.
          (notices something down

                         BELOW)
          Shit. I'm gonna have to call you
          back.
          Joel hangs up and runs downstairs.

          ON THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR:
          Boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line.
          Step sees this, runs to shut off the line, yelling at Mary.

                         STEP
          What are you doing?!

                         MARY
          What are YOU doing?!
          (pointing at Hector)
          What is he doing?
          A YELLING/BICKERING MATCH breaks out between Mary, Step, Rory
          and Gabriella. Joel runs over, shuts off the conveyor belt.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          All right. Now, what's the
          problem?
          They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Okay! Okay, everyone settle down.
          Now Mary. Hector here is new okay?
          It's gonna take him a couple of
          days, maybe his English isn't so
          good. You gotta be patient.

                         STEP
          That's what I was tryin' to say.

                         JOEL
          And Step, if you wanna be Floor
          Manager, this is the kind of thing
          you're going to have to deal with.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         STEP

                         (KISS-ASS)
          Exactly.

                         JOEL
          Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's
          get this cleaned up, and get
          rolling again. We can't afford to
          fall behind today.
          Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts
          right back up with Gabriella.

                         MARY
          You see that? We always get the
          blame.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

          Joel sits in his swivel chair, looking down at the production
          floor, shaking his head. BRIAN, Joel's second in command,
          walks in. He's a little older than Joel, neatly trimmed
          beard, aviator glasses, and a bit of a gut. He wears a
          Reynold's Extract golf shirt and Khaki pants. He walks over
          to the window, joins Joel, looking down at the employees.

                         JOEL 
          Jesus... They're like a bunch of 
          goddamned children. 

                         BRIAN
          Tell me about it. Sorry I missed
          the drama; I was showing boy-genius
          down there how to back up a
          forklift.
          ANGLE ON Rory, driving the forklift, handing out a flier as 
          he passes someone. 

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          That's his whole career, driving
          that damn forklift. You'd think
          he'd wanna learn how.

                         JOEL 
          Well, I guess he's got that band 
          he's in too... 

                         BRIAN
          (disgust at the word

                         "BAND")
          "Band", ugh...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          I'll bet dollars to donuts he sucks
          at that too. Then you got ah...
          (tries to remember her
          name but can't)
          Dinkus down there...

                          JOEL 
          Who, Mary? 

                          BRIAN
          No, the other one -- what's-her-
          face -- she asked me -- or rather
          "axed" me -- for more personal
          days. Just like that. I told her
          maybe if she figures out how to
          fill out the time sheets correctly
          I'll give her more personal days...
          (Off Joel's look)
          Don't worry, she will never fill
          out her time sheets correctly.
          Joel looks down at the production floor. Joel's POV: 
           ANGLE ON: Mary and Step bickering. Step walks off. Mary and 
           Gabrielle shaking their heads and yapping like a couple of 
          old hens. 

          JOEL (O.S.)
          Look at 'em... I am so sick of baby
          sitting these assholes.
          (looks at his watch)
          I better get going...
          Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling something about 
          "sweatpants." 

          INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

          Joel drives home, in a hurry, checking his dashboard clock.
          It's an upscale neighborhood of McMansions in a town like
          Lincoln Nebraska. He turns a corner, slows down suddenly
          when he sees something.

                         JOEL'S POV:
          NATHAN, a middle-aged, overweight, annoying guy is going out
          to the street to get his mail.

                         JOEL
          (to himself, praying)
          Please go back inside... Please
          just turn around.. .Come on...don't
          notice me...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          It's too late. Nathan turns, sees Joel's car and waves, then
          crosses the street to Joel's driveway and waits to talk to
          him.

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Shit!
          Joel pulls into his driveway as Nathan flags him down. Joel
          begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan
          can talk to him.

                         NATHAN
          Hi there Joel! Glad I caught ya...
          Nathan settles in like he's going to be there a while,
          leaning with his arms folded, hanging inside the car,
          trapping Joel.

                         NATHAN
          How've ya been? I left you a
          message last week. I don't know if
          you got it or not.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, actually Nathan, I'm kind of
          in a hurry here.

                         NATHAN
          Oh yeah? You been busy?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, in fact...
          (checks his watch)
          I should go right now actually. I
          gotta call the office before they
          leave.

                         NATHAN
          Well, real quick while I got ya
          here -- what're you guys doing
          November 17th?

                         JOEL
          Ah, I don't ah...
          (realizes his should fake

                         IT)
          Actually we're going to be out of
          town that weekend.

                         NATHAN
          Oh yeah? Where you going?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         JOEL
          Ah...

                         NATHAN
          Oh, wait a minute -- I'm sorry, I
          meant the 7th. Yeah, November 7th.
          You'll be in town then right?

                         JOEL

                         (DEFEATED)
          Ah...Yeah.

                         NATHAN
          Great. There's this dinner Leslie
          and I are going to. It's an annual
          thing -- we do it every year with
          the Rotary Club -- it's for
          charity. It's just a whole lot of
          fun, and we wanted to invite you
          and Suzie to be our guests at our
          table. It's--

                         JOEL
          I'm sorry, I ah... I just don't
          think that's something we're gonna
          want to do.

                         NATHAN
          Really? Why not? It's a lot of
          fun.

                         JOEL
          Oh, I don't know. Suzie doesn't
          really like going to stuff like

                         THAT--

                         NATHAN
          Why not?

                         JOEL
          Well, we wouldn't know anybody
          there. She get's kind of
          uncomfortable.

                         NATHAN
          Oh no -- It's not like that. She
          won't be uncomfortable. I
          guarantee it. No, it's not like
          that at all. It's not formal or
          anything. Trust me. It's just a
          real loose bunch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         JOEL
          I just don't...

                         NATHAN
          I tell you what. Why don't we do
          this -- I'll go ahead and get
          tickets, since they're gonna sell
          out fast. You talk to Suzie. See
          what she says. Like I say, she
          won't be uncomfortable at all.
          Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a
          call -- you know how it is when the
          wives talk, heh heh--
          Joel is about to snap.

                         JOEL
          Um, why don't we talk about this
          later.
          (looks at his watch)
          I gotta make this call before they
          leave.
          Joel pulls away, forcing Nathan to raise off the window sill.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING BACK)
          Sorry... I just gotta make this
          call!

          INT. JOEL'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel pulls the car in, steps out and is shocked to see Nathan
          right there in his garage.

                         NATHAN
          Sorry, I almost forgot -- the
          tickets are forty dollars a plate.
          I know that's a little steep, but
          the food is fantastic and it's for
          a good cause. So that'd be eighty
          dollars total. There's no tax or
          anything.

                         JOEL
          Ah, look Nathan, I really gotta get
          inside and make this call. Let's
          talk about this another time.
          Joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door,
          waiting for Nathan to get out. Nathan stops, just inside.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, and if you need us to look out
          for the house or anything when you
          go out of town --
          Joel's finger still on the garage door button.

                         NATHAN
          Well, just let us know. Where you
          guys going anyway?

                         JOEL

                         (BULLSHITTING)
          Ah, just sort of a vacation. Look,
          I gotta run.
          Joel hits the button and the door starts going down.

                         NATHAN
          Alright then. We'll see ya.
          Nathan finally steps out of the garage. Joel breaths a huge
          sigh of relief. Then,

          ANGLE ON THE GARAGE DOOR:
          As it gets halfway down, we see Nathan's legs, heading back
          towards the door. Nathan leans down into frame as the door
          goes down.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, Joel one more thing--
          Joel lets the door shut on him, and bolts into the house.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Joel walks into the living room just as his wife, SUZIE,
          enters from the bedroom pulling on her SWEATPANTS. A look of
          disappointment on Joel's face. Suzie is a decent looking
          woman, about Joel's age.

                         JOEL
          Man, that Nathan won't shut up.

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, what an asshole. I don't
          even go into the front yard
          anymore. That wife of his is even
          worse.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          Suzie plops down on the couch looking tired and pissed off.
          Joel sits down next to her.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          We gotta get a new pool cleaner.I
          don't think that asshole checked
          the chlorine levels again like I
          asked him too...
          Joel puts his arm around her, caresses her shoulder. She
          doesn't seem to notice as he starts getting fresh.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          .and every time he is here, he
          goes on and on about some problem
          with the goddamn filter, and I have
          no idea what he's talking about...
           Delayed reaction -- she notices Joel is getting frisky. He 
          gets closer, starts kissing her neck.

                          SUZIE (CONT'D)

                         (UNCOMFORTABLE)
          Ah,...Joel?

                         JOEL
          What?

                         SUZIE
          I'm sorry. It's just... I'm a
          little tired, and, I don't know,
          it's the middle of the week...

                         JOEL
          It's not the middle of the week.
          It's Monday. Why can't--

                         SUZIE
          Monday?
          (Freezes, suddenly

                         REALIZING SOMETHING)
          Oh shit!

                         JOEL

                         (WORRIED)
          What?!

                         SUZIE
          Idol!
          Suzie jumps up with newfound energy, runs for the remote and
          turns on the TV. Joel just sits there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Suzie plops down in a Barcalounger.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          Sorry honey. Maybe this weekend.
          Joel leaves the room.

          INT. JOEL'S BATHROOM -- LATER

          [Quick scene of Joel trying to masturbate (off screen of
          course), but he's too distracted by the sounds of a bad out-
          of-tune Idol audition blaring through the wall.] 

          EXT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Establishing shot. A sports bar that's part of a Holiday
          Inn.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS -- CONTINUOUS

          Joel sits at the bar. DEAN, the owner of the bar, late
          forties, and an old friend of Joel's, sits behind the bar on
          a stool.

                         JOEL
          I gotta get a house with a bathroom
          that's doesn't share a wall with
          the TV.

                         DEAN
          Why don't you do that in another
          bathroom. You've got three of 'em.

                         JOEL
          It would look suspicious. We never
          use those other bathrooms... Maybe
          if I had some insulation put in...

                         DEAN
          Insulation?... All I know is, you
          shouldn't move man; you've got a
          nice house. I mean you've got the
          American dream really -- you own
          your own company. I can't believe
          you used to bar back for me here,
          and now you've got all that.

                         JOEL
          But what do I have really? It's a
          big pain in the ass.

          13.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          I'm always working; can't stop or
          the whole place will fall apart.
          And what good does it do me anyway?
          I don't get laid. That stock guy
          with the shitty band that works for
          me probably gets laid more than I
          do.

                         DEAN
          (trying to help)
          Yeah, but he probably lives in a
          crappy apartment.

                         JOEL
          Hell, I'd move into a crappy
          apartment if the bathroom wasn't
          right next to the TV.

          INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY

          CINDY, a girl in her early twenties, is at the counter
          looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one of
          the really nice ones. The price tag says $3,950. She's
          beautiful and sexy and all that, but there's something
          vulnerable and sweet about her as well.
          Two SALESMEN, typical music store employees -- long-haired,
          goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much
          attention. It's clear that they don't usually have women
          this hot in their store. They practically stumble over each
          other trying to help her.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Yeah, it's expensive but it's
          sweet... Are you familiar with the
          Gibson humbucking pickups?

                         CINDY
          No, sorry. I don't play. It's for
          my Dad actually -- for his
          fiftieth birthday. My sisters and
          I are all pitching in.

                         SALESMAN #2
          Ah, that's nice... Your Dad would
          love these humbuckings. They
          really kick ass.
          An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has been waiting behind Cindy,
          trying to get some help, but he might as well be invisible.
          He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         MALE CUSTOMER
          Excuse me... I just have a quick
          question...
          Salesman #2 is oblivious, never takes his eyes off Cindy.

                         SALESMAN #2

                         (OBLIVIOUS)
          So, what kind of music did he play?
          Both Salesmen's eyes are glued to Cindy as Male Customer
          finally gets sick of waiting and storms off into the keyboard
          room.

                         CINDY
          I think he played like, jazz or
          something. I'm not sure.

                         SALESMAN #2
          Well this is an excellent jazz
          guitar. It's what Pat Metheny
          plays.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Is your Dad into Metheny at all?

                         CINDY
          Oh, I don't know who that is.
          Sorry.

                         SALESMAN #2
          He's like, a totally kickass fusion
          guitarist. Are you into fusion?

                         CINDY
          I don't really know much about
          it...

                         SALESMAN #2
          I play fusion guitar so... Just
          curious.

                         CINDY
          Um, do they come in any other
          colors?

                         SALESMAN #1
          You mean different finishes?
          There's a sunburst finish we might
          have in stock.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         SALESMAN #2
          Yeah, do you wanna see it? I'll go
          get it.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Or I could go. Whatever.

                         CINDY
          Are you sure?

                         SALESMAN #1/SALESMAN #2
          Oh totally./ No prob!/ I'll show
          you the case it comes with too.
          The salesmen practically trip over each other, going into the
          back to find the other guitar.
          Cindy stands there alone for a beat. She looks around. Then
          casually picks up the four-thousand dollar guitar and walks
          out the front door with it.

          EXT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

           Cindy walks a few yards over to her car, a ' 92 Tercel, puts
           the guitar in the trunk, gets in and takes off.

          INT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

          The two Salesmen return -- one carrying the sunburst-finish
          guitar and the other with the hard-shell case. They look
          around, notice she's gone. They stand there for a beat,
          disappointed, before they realize what just happened.

                         SALESMAN #1
          Oh shit!...

                         (FRANTICALLY LOOKING

                         AROUND)

          THE GIBSON!
          They run out the front door, but Cindy is long gone.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          Joel is at his desk. Brian comes in, excited.

                         BRIAN
          You're not gonna believe this.
          Remember the guy from General Mills
          that called a while back? Talking
          like he wanted to buy us out?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         JOEL
          I thought you said he wasn't
          serious; he was just sniffing
          around.

                         BRIAN
          Yeah, well he's serious now. He
          just made an offer -- I mean a real
          offer this time.

                         JOEL
          You're kidding.

                         BRIAN
          No. It must be part of some bigger
          strategic move, because it's over
          market value I think.

                         JOEL
          Wow...
          Joel lets it sink in. He walks over to the window, looking
          down on the production floor.

                         JOEL
          I could unload all this... I could
          probably retire...

                         BRIAN
          I mean, yeah, there's a lot of
          details to work out, but this could
          be great. They'll be calling back
          next week, what should I tell them?
          Joel looks down, sees Mary sitting with her arms folded,
          shaking her head.

                         JOEL
          Tell 'em hell yes.

          bottles shatter.
          - Rory, carrying some boxes slips on the broken bottles of
          goopey extract, falls and slides into an aisle.
          - A forklift stops suddenly to avoid hitting Rory, causing a
          huge stack of pallets to fall off.
          - Quick shot of Mary shaking her head in slow-motion.
          - Just as Step rounds a corner to see what's going on, the

          Step is on a stretcher being loaded into a MEDIVAC helicopter
          by a couple of EMS guys. Step moans in pain as Joel tries to
          comfort him. A small crowd of employees watch.
          ANGLE ON Mary in the crowd, shaking her head.

                         MARY
          I knew it. That's what happens
          when you don't pay attention.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS -- LATER

          Joel sits at the bar, on a cell phone. Dean sits behind the
          bar on a stool.

                         JOEL
          (to the person on the

                         PHONE)
          Uh-huh... Alright. Let me know if
          you hear anything else.
          He hangs up, talks to Dean.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Well, he's definitely lost one of
          'em. They think they might be able
          to re-attach the other one, but
          they're not sure.

          Wow...

                         JOEL
          Yeah... I'm not sure how it
          happened, but we have a great
          safety record and we comply with
          all the safety codes so... it was
          just a freak accident. There'll be
          an investigation of some kind I'm
          sure.

                         DEAN
          Well, you have insurance for that
          kind of thing, right?

                         JOEL
          Oh yeah. Of course. In fact,
          he'll probably get a huge
          settlement.

                         DEAN
          Yeah. I would think so. I mean,
          it's your balls...
          Beat, as they contemplate the profundity of it.

                         JOEL
          Boy it really makes you stop and
          think about how fragile we are --
          especially our balls. They're just
          hanging there in a little sack
          between our legs. At any moment
          they could be cut off forever.

                         DEAN
          Yeah. And your balls are really
          important man. Your balls are
          everything. What kind of life would
          you have with no testicles? Can you
          imagine that shit?

                         JOEL
          Yeah...
          Beat.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          You know Dean, my life wouldn't be
          much different than it is now
          actually.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Except for once every three months
          when I have sex with my wife. In
          fact, I might even be better off...

                         DEAN
          Wait. Three months? I thought you
          said it was once a month.

                         JOEL
          I did? I must've been lying. I
          don't know... Maybe things'll get
          better when I sell the company.
          I'll be around more...

                         DEAN
          Well, I hope so. That would
          suck... I get laid all the time.
          (off Joel's reaction)
          Sorry.

                         JOEL
          Ah, it's all right...

                         (THINKS)
          Actually, it sucks.

                         DEAN
          Yeah, sexual frustration is bad
          news... You know what you oughtta
          do?

                         JOEL
          What?

                         DEAN
          Get some Xanax.

                         JOEL
          Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety?

                         DEAN
          Yeah it is, but I find it's good
          for just about any phsychological
          problem. I mean, basically it just
          makes you feel good, so it sort of
          works for anything. I even take it
          when I have a cold. It's probably
          great for sexual frustration. Want
          me to get you some?

                         JOEL
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         DEAN
          You know what else is good?
          Codeine cough syrup.

                         JOEL
          For what?

                         DEAN
          It's just good.
          Joel looks at Dean for a beat.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Are you on something now?

                         DEAN
          No... Well, I guess I took some
          Vicodin this morning. But that was
          just 'cause I was hung-over.

          EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY

          Establishing shot, a pawn shop in a strip mall. Cindy's car
          parked out in front.

          INT. PAWN SHOP - CONTINUOUS

          Cindy is at the counter, the Gibson guitar we saw earlier is
          in front of her. A PAWN SHOP GUY is counting out money. He
          pauses, looks around, then speaks sympathetically to her.

          PAWN SHOP GUY
          Um, you know, I'm really not
          supposed to say this... but since
          this belonged to your father, and
          since he passed away and all...

                         (QUIETLY)
          You could probably get a better
          deal at a music store.

                         CINDY
          Oh, that's okay. Thanks. But I
          just kind of wanna get it over
          with, you know? It's kind of hard
          for me.

          PAWN SHOP GUY
          I understand.
          He looks around to see if his boss is watching, then counts
          off a FEW MORE TWENTIES, feeling sorry for her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
           PAWN SHOP GUY (cont'd)
          Here.

          INT. CINDY'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Cindy puts the money in her wallet, along with a driver's
          license.

          CLOSE ON THE WALLET.
          Cindy shuffles through three or four different driver's
          licenses. On one, her name says MISTY PATTERSON. It's a
          Kansas license. She takes another one out from Colorado,
          with the name CINDY METZLER on it and puts that in front,
          then puts the wallet away.
          A newspaper sits on the front seat. Something grabs her
          attention.

          ANGLE ON THE NEWSPAPER:
          We see an article about Step's accident. There's a picture
          of Step being taken away on the stretcher.
          Cindy starts reading the article, with growing interest.

                         CINDY'S POV:
          She scans the article, zeroing in on certain words,
          ".. .potentially big settlement..." "...no testicles..."
          "several million dollars" then back to "no testicles" then
          quickly back and forth several times -- "million dollars" "no
          testicles" "million dollars" "no testicles"
          ON CINDY'S FACE - A look of determination. She looks one
          more time at the name under the picture -- Don "Step"
          Wilkenson, then zeroes in on the words "Reynold's Extract."
          She starts the car and speeds away.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Joel sits with Brian. Brian has a clipboard, going over the 
          day's business. 

                         BRIAN
          So obviously Step's not coming back
          anytime soon. I had to hire a
          couple temps. Is that okay?

                         JOEL 
          Yeah, sure. How is Step? 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         BRIAN
          Better. They say he's going home
          in a couple of days. Speaking of
          which, the guys at General Mills
          heard about this whole Step thing.
          They're worried. If Step decides
          to sue us -- beyond the insurance
          settlement -- it could be a serious
          liability. They don't want to make
          an offer until this thing has
          settled.

                         JOEL 
          Really? They think it's that big 
          of a liability? 

                         BRIAN
          Well yeah. Don't you? I mean,
          think about it. Imagine if you
          asked a bunch of jurors how much
          you'd have to pay 'em to cut their
          balls off? I mean, I wouldn't let
          someone cut my balls off for a
          billion dollars. Seriously --
          unless there were some kind of
          really expensive operation that
          could give you artificial balls or
          something. Would you?

                         JOEL 
          No, I guess not. 

                         BRIAN
          Anyway, I wouldn't worry. He says
          he's not going to sue us. Says he

                         (CRUDE IMITATION)
          "don't want somethin' fer nothin "'
          and "What's right is right." If we
          can just get him to sign something
          to that effect we should be fine.

                         JOEL 
          Boy, Step sure is being mellow 
          about all this. 

                         BRIAN
          Yeah, well I think when you lose
          your balls it mellows you out. You
          don't get as pissed off and
          aggressive about things. I know
          it's true for horses, and bulls.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         JOEL
          Boy, it sure does make you think.. 

                         BRIAN 
          Oh, by the way, guess who asked for 
          a raise today? 

                         JOEL 
          Who? 

                         BRIAN

                         (GESTURES INDISCRIMINATELY
          to someone downstairs)
          Dinkus. Can you believe that?

                         JOEL
          Brian, you call everyone here
          "Dinkus." I don't know who you're
          talking about.

                         BRIAN 
          You know, Forklift-Dinkus? 

                         JOEL 
          Oh... I thought you call him "boy- 
          genius." 

                         BRIAN
          Yeah, well boy-genius asked for a
          raise. I said, "are you kidding?
          You nearly got someone killed last
          week," and then he blamed it on
          Dinkus over there.

                         JOEL 
          You know Brian, you really ought to 
          learn the employees' names. 

                         BRIAN
          Well, I was thinking about that,
          but hey, if this deal goes through
          next week, I won't have to. It's
          not like I'm gonna be inviting
          Dinkus and Boy-Genius over for
          dinner.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

          Joel stands on one side of his office looking down through a
          long window overlooking the manufacturing area. Dean comes
          in, walks over to the window, looks down at the production
          floor with Joel.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         DEAN
          Hey man. What's goin' o-- Whoa!
           DEAN'S POV: It's CINDY, now working down on the floor, on
          the assembley line.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
          Damn! Who's she? Is she new?

                         JOEL
          Yeah. She's a temp.

                         DEAN
          She's a tramp?

                         JOEL
          No a temp. Quit staring.

                         DEAN
          Damn, she's hot! Way to go.

                         JOEL
          Hey, I didn't hire her. She came
          here through Manpower, like
          everybody else. They just sent her
          over.

                         DEAN
          Manpower, huh? Maybe I should give
          them a call. You don't usually
          have girls anywhere near that hot
          working here. What's the deal?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I know. I guess it makes
          sense though if you think about it.
          Hot girls need a job just as much
          as anyone else.

                         DEAN
          (thinks for a second)
          Do they really?... Huh... You just
          don't see 'em here. Usually your
          temps look like winos. And they're
          guys.

                         JOEL
          You wanna hear something really
          weird?

                         DEAN
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         JOEL
          She came on to me.

                         DEAN
          No way! Really?

                         JOEL
          Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty sure. I
          could be wrong, but...

                         DEAN
          Hey, I'm sure she did. Are you
          kidding? You could have any girl
          down there.

                         JOEL
          I don't know about that.

                         DEAN
          I'm serious. Dude, you're the big
          shot here. You're the king of...
          What do you call that shit you make
          here again?

                         JOEL
          Extract. And spray-dried
          flavoring, and we're branching out

                         INTO--

                         DEAN
          Yeah, you're the Extract King man.
          You could have any girl here. I
          mean, I wouldn't want most of 'em,
          but her... Way to go Joel.
          Dean looks down at manufacturing area, taking it all in.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
          So how did she come on to you?

                         JOEL
          Well, first she started asking me
          about what happened to Step and all
          that stuff -- you know, just sort
          of making conversation?

                         DEAN
          Yeah.

                         JOEL
          But it really seemed like she was
          flirting with me, you know?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Then, she just sort of asked me
          out... I think.

                         DEAN
          Really? How?

                         JOEL
          Well, you see that guy down there
          by the fork lift?
          ANGLE ON Rory, the indi-rock guy with tattoos, etc.

                          JOEL (CONT'D)
          His band is playing somewhere, at
          some party this weekend, and she
          asked me if I wanted to go with
          her.

                         DEAN
          Wow. So, you gonna do anything
          about it?

                         JOEL
          What? No. No way. I couldn't
          live with myself if I cheated on
          Suzie... It'd be nice if I got
          laid at home once in a while
          though...

                         DEAN

          Man, she is fine. You mind if I
          hit that then?

          Yeah, I do sort of...
          We see a COMMOTION down on the floor. Mary runs out of the
           Women's locker room SCREAMING AND YELLING.

                         ACTION
          Mary runs over to where Hector is working, hysterical.

                         MARY
          My purse is stolen! It's gone!
          (pointing at Hector)
          He did it! He stole my purse!

          Brian runs over and stands between them, trying to calm Mary
          down, but she keeps ranting. Hector looks confused and
          worried.

                         BRIAN
          Now hold on--

                         MARY
          I won't hold on! I'll call the
          cops!

                         HECTOR
          (confused, frightened)
          What? I don'... No comprende...

                         BRIAN

                         (HORRIBLE SPANISH)
          Espera un momento Hector. Tu sabes
          donde esta su... uh, purse?
          ANGLE ON CINDY, watching the whole thing-- completely
          unfazed.Joel rushes in.

                         JOEL
          Now wait a second. Calm down Mary.
          How do you know it was stolen?

                         MARY
          It's gone! That's how.

                         JOEL
          Well, what did it look like.

                         MARY
          It was black with a fur, leopard
          style border...

          Cindy sits in her parked car, going through the purse Mary
          just described. She takes some cash, puts it in her pocket,
          then finds what she's looking for -- the address book.

          ANGLE ON ADDRESS BOOK.
          Cindy turns to the Ws and finds Step Wilkenson. She notes
          his address. She starts the car and takes off.

          EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF STEP'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

          Cindy sits and waits, listening to the radio. It's a very
          blue-collar neighborhood. She's about three houses away from
          Step's house, keeping an eye on it.
          After a beat, Step limps out of the house, walks over to his
          pickup truck, painfully gets in, and leaves. Cindy starts
          the car and follows from a distance.

          INT. GROCERY STORE - A LITTLE LATER

          Step wheels his shopping cart into one of the checkout lines.
          He uses the cart as a crutch to help him walk. Cindy gets in
          line behind him. She only has one item, a bottle of
          Reynold's Orange Extract. Step notices her.

                         STEP
          You can go ahead of me if that's
          all you have.

                         CINDY

                         (SWEETLY)
          Thank you so much.
          (holds up extract bottle)
          I can't believe I'm buying this
          stuff -- I work at the factory.

                         STEP
          Really? I work there too. Or, ah,
          I used to.

                         CINDY
          Really? You're kidding! I just
          started there. What's your name?

                         STEP
          I go by Step. Yeah, I'm the
          fastest sorter there...

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Joel enters the living room. He first sees the sweatpants,
          then sees Suzie is sound asleep on the couch. He sighs, then
          turns and leaves.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean. Joel is drinking some
          kind of hard liquor, getting a buzz.

                         JOEL
          I'm sick of it Dean. I'm sick of
          being turned down in my own house
          by my own wife. We're turning into
          one of those brother-sister
          couples.

                         DEAN
          Huh...Now that you mention it, you
          guys kind of look alike too.

                         JOEL

                         (GROSSED OUT)
          No we don't!

                         DEAN
          Okay.

                         JOEL
          (takes a drink)
          Maybe things will be better after I
          sell the company... Or maybe it's
          just going to mean more time to sit
          around and contemplate not getting
          laid.
          Dean nods sympathetically.

                         DEAN
          What about that girl at work? She
          still into you?

                         JOEL
          Yeah... she was really coming on to
          me. She gave me her phone number
          and everything. Told me to call
          her if I wanted to go to that
          party. Can you believe that? And
          there's nothing I can do about it,
          but just be sexually frustrated.

                         DEAN
          I've got some Xanax if you want it.
          Like I say, that always works for
          me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         JOEL
          No thanks...

                         DEAN
          Well maybe you should call that
          girl.

                         JOEL
          No, I can't. I can't cheat on
          Suzie. I just gotta power through
          it until I'm so old that I can't
          get it up anymore.

                         DEAN
          What about if Suzie cheated on you?

                         JOEL
          Hmm... I hadn't even thought of
          that...

                         (BEAT)
          I wish she would.

                         DEAN
          You wish she would cheat on you?
          Wouldn't that bother you?
          Joel thinks about it.

                         JOEL
          No. I don't think it would
          actually.
          (occuring to him)
          I guess that's weird huh?

                         DEAN
          Yeah, it's a little weird. Sort
          of.

                         JOEL
          But see, then I could do something
          about all this sexual frustration,
          without feeling guilty about it.

                         DEAN
          Do you think she would cheat on
          you?

                         JOEL
          Nah...

                         DEAN
          You sure?

                         JOEL

                         (CONSIDERS IT)
          Well, I don't know. Hmm... Maybe
          if she were really tempted she
          would. Like if some really studly
          guy came on to her.

                         DEAN
          So you're saying she would probably
          cheat on you if she was put in
          temptation's way?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, maybe.

                         DEAN
          You know what you oughtta do?

                         JOEL

                         (WEARY)
          I don't wanna do any drugs Dean.

                         DEAN
          No, no. Check this out -- If you
          really wish your wife would cheat
          on you, it's not that hard to make
          it happen.

                         JOEL
          How?

                         DEAN
          Hire a gigolo to have an affair
          with your wife.

                         JOEL
          What?

                         DEAN
          I'm serious. I know a guy.

                         JOEL

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          You know a gigolo?

                         DEAN
          Yeah.

                         JOEL
          How do you know a gigolo?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         DEAN
          This guy Brad. He comes in here
          all the time. He's a friend of
          Vic's. You could hire him to have
          an affair with Suzie.

                         JOEL
          Come on Dean.

                         DEAN
          Why not? You said you wouldn't
          care if she cheated on you. Then
          you'd be free to go out with that
          Cindy chick and get your ya-yas out
          -- with no guilt. Problem solved.
          (proud of himself)
          Man, what a great idea.
          Joel just shakes his head at the whole thing.

                         JOEL
          You know, maybe I will try some of
          that Xanax.
          Dean reaches down under the cash register and whips out a
          little box and pulls out a pill.

          EXT. LAKE -- SAME TIME

          Step's truck is parked out at a lake in the country. He and
          Cindy sit next to each other on the tailgate, looking at the
          stars, talking.

                         STEP
          I just believe that what's
          right is right.

                         CINDY
          That's right Step, and what's right
          is for you to send a message.

                         STEP
          A message?

                         CINDY
          You need to send a message so that
          a horrible accident like this never
          happens to anyone else ever again.
          That's what's right. And the way
          you do that is to take them to
          court.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         STEP
          You think?

                         CINDY
          Yes Step... That's why I called a
          lawyer for you -- that guy on all
          the bus stop benches.

                         STEP
          Joe Adler?

                         (TOUCHED)
          You did that for me?

                         CINDY
          Mmm hmm... I just want you to do
          what's right Step.
          They start cuddling, kissing. Cindy pulls away.

                         CINDY
          I'm sorry Step, your doctor said
          you shouldn't get aroused.

                         STEP
          No he didn't.

                         CINDY
          Maybe it was your lawyer, but he
          talked to your doctor. And your
          doctor said it's very important not
          to get aroused until after the
          trial... I'm sorry.

                         STEP
          That's okay... You're so good to me
          Cindy.
          They start cuddling again.

                         CINDY
          Look Step, you're getting me turned
          on, I'm getting you turned on... I
          better just go.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- LATER

          Joel is starting to look really tweaked as the drug-alcohol
          combination begins to kick in.
          Dean is examining a pill under the cash register light,
          trying to read the small print. He looks concerned.

                         DEAN
          Shit... Do you remember what color
          that pill I gave you was?

                         JOEL
          Huh?

                         DEAN
          Damn. I don't think it was Xanax.
          I think that might've been
          Ritalin... Or "Special K."

                         JOEL
          (feeling the buzz)
          Ah, who cares?

                         DEAN
          It's just that, ah, Special K is a
          horse tranquilizer, kinda has a
          weird effect when people take it
          but... well, don't worry about
          it... You might not want to drink
          too much more though.

                         SPEECH)
          You know that thing you were
          talking about? About the gigolo?

                         DEAN
          Yeah?

                         JOEL
          Do you think it would be wrong to
          do that? I mean morally wrong?

                         DEAN
          (with full authority)
          Oh nooo. Definitely not. What
          could be morally wrong about it?

                         JOEL
          I don't know...

                         DEAN
          Look, if she doesn't want to go for
          it, she doesn't have to. And if
          she does, then she's the one who
          sinned, and then it's perfectly
          morally right for you to go out and
          boff whoever you want.

                         (SLURRED SPEECH)
          Yeah, I guess you're right. I
          can't think of anything morally
          wrong about it either.
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          And this guy, he's a friend of
          yours? What's his name?

                         DEAN
          Brad. You want me to give him a
          call?

                         JOEL
          I don't know. It's kinda weird
          even talking about it.

                         DEAN
          Look, this is no big deal Joel.
          I'm serious.

                         JOEL
          Really?

                         DEAN
          Yeah. I mean, you can't lose. Just
          say you're hiring him to come clean
          the pool or something. See what
          happens. If she doesn't go for it,
          then at least you know you're doing
          the right thing by being faithful.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I guess you're right... I
          don't know. It's crazy.
          Dean pours Joel another drink.

                         DEAN
          Look. Have another drink. Think
          about it... You know what? Why
          don't I just call Brad and see what
          he has to say?

                         JOEL
          Alright. What the hell.
          Joel takes a big swig of liquor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

           INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR - BACK OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Dean and Joel are talking with BRAD, the gigolo. He's young,
           blonde, super good-looking, but clearly a complete airhead.
          Joel looks really messed up now.

                         JOEL
          So it's two-hundred dollars then?

                         BRAD
          Yeah, two-hundred.

                         DEAN
          Well yeah, but don't forget, I'm
          getting ten percent.

                         JOEL
          What, so you're a pimp now?

                         DEAN

                         (CONDESCENDING CHUCKLE)
          I don't think they're called
          "pimps" when it's with male
          prostitutes, okay. There's some
          other word for it -- it's not a
          "john," but it's something like
          that. Besides, I'm the one who
          hooked all this up. And don't worry
          'cuz it's coming out of Brad's
          money anyway.

                         JOEL
          Alright, alright.

                         (TO BRAD)
          So it's two-hundred dollars then?

                         DEAN
          Two-hundred and twenty.

                         JOEL
          Wait a minute--

                         BRAD
          Um, I have a question?

                         JOEL
          Yeah?
          Brad looks at Joel, deeply concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         BRAD
          So like, are you gonna, like, watch
          or something?

                         JOEL
          No no no. God no! It's not like
          that. I won't even be there. I'll
          be at work. Remember? We already
          talked about this.
          Brad looks blank, like he's not getting it.

                         JOEL
          What you'll do, is come to my house
          pretending to be the new pool
          cleaner. Then you simply try to
          seduce my wife. Okay? If she
          doesn't respond, you simply clean
          the pool and leave. That's all.
          It's that simple.
          Hold on Brad for a long beat.

                         BRAD
          So, uh, you're not gonna touch my
          ass or anything...?

                         JOEL
          NO! Try to pay attention okay? I
          will not be there. I will be at
          work. You come over to my house
          while I'm not there, posing as the
          new pool cleaner and then try to
          seduce her...
          Brad finally makes a breakthrough.

                         BRAD
          Oooh, I see. Sorry man. Yeah,
          yeah. I get it now. You're not
          even gonna be there...

                         JOEL
          Yeah, that's right.

                         BRAD
          Yeah... cool. No problem. This is
          gonna be great!

                         JOEL
          Remember, she might not go for it--
          Brad starts to get a little too excited.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, this is gonna be cool! I can
          hardly wait! Awesome. Hey man, if
          you know anyone else who needs --
          you know -- what I do, like you
          know, lonely housewives and shit,
          maybe you could tell 'em about me,
          you know...
          Joel looks on with growing concern as Brad can't seem to stop
          talking.

                         BRAD
          Cuz like, I figure if I did a
          few jobs and I was, like, really
          good? Then maybe they'd tell their
          friends, you know, and they'd give
          me a... what do you call those
          things?

                         DEAN
          Referrals.

                         BRAD
          Yeah yeah, those things. Then
          those women could tell more women
          and then it'd be like I was, like,
          uh... branching or..

                         DEAN
          Networking.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, networking! Totally. Then
          if I got enough of 'em, maybe I
          could quit my landscaping job and
          do this full time. That would be
          awesome! Cause I hate landscaping.
          I like getting laid a lot better,
          and my boss is a total dick...

          EXT. SCOREBOARDS' PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

          Joel and Dean are at Dean's car, trying to say goodbye to
          Brad, who still won't shut up.

                         BRAD
          Like I say, if your wife has any
          housewife friends who might--
          Dean finally puts his foot down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         DEAN
          Okay, you've said that a few times
          now Brad. Go on to your car.
          Okay?

                         BRAD
          Alright. Cool. Like I say--

                         DEAN
          Goodnight Brad.

                         BRAD
          Okay. See you later.
          Brad finally leaves.

                         DEAN
          Let me drive you home. You're in
          no condition to drive.
          Joel stumbles into Dean's car.

                         JOEL
          Are you sure about this guy Dean?
          He acts like he's never done this
          before.

                         DEAN
          Oh no. He does it all the time.
          Don't worry. He just gets a little
          excited sometimes. He's cool.

                         JOEL
          I don't know. He sure doesn't seem
          too bright.

                         DEAN
          Yeah well, what do you excpect?
          He's a whore.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM - NEXT MORNING

          A break room with a kitchen. Joel is badly hungover. He
          looks like he's about to throw up as he reaches into the
          cupboard above the sink, downs a couple of aspirin, then
          drops some alka-seltzer in to a glass of water. Cindy comes
          in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         CINDY
          Looks like you had one of those
          nights.

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          Where was I?
          Joel nods, tries to grin and look cool as he takes a sip of
          his alkaseltzer. Then his eyes go wide, he almost does a
          spit-take as something suddenly dawns on him...

                         JOEL
          Oh shit!
          He runs out of the room.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE

          Joel grabs the phone and dials frantically. Dean answers.

                          JOEL
           Dean?

           DEAN (V.0.)

                         (WAKING UP)
          Oh, hey Joel.

                         JOEL
          Thank God you're home. Ah,... did
          that really happen last night? I
          mean, did we go through with it --
          with that gigolo stuff?

                         DEAN
          Ah, yeah. As far as I know.

                         JOEL
          Shit! What was I thinking?! We
          gotta call it off. Right now. Can
          you call that guy, Brad?

                         DEAN
          Okay...

                         JOEL
          Tell him I'll pay him anyway,
          whatever, just don't come over.
          God, what was I thinking?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         DEAN
          Sure, I'll call him. No problem...
          Oh wait a second. I don't think I
          have his number.

                         JOEL
          What? I thought you called him
          last night.

                         DEAN
          Yeah, but I got his number from
          Vic.

                         JOEL
          Well get it from him again.

                         DEAN
          Vic doesn't have a phone right now.

                         JOEL
          Shit! I'll try information.
          What's Brad's last name?
          Pause.

                         DEAN
          Hmm... it's something like,... I
          think it's a Mexican name.

                         JOEL

                         (LOSING PATIENCE)
          Mexican?! The guy's got blonde
          hair and blue eyes!

                         DEAN
          Yeah, I thought it was weird too --
          a guy like that with a Mexican last
          name... It's like Lopez, or Sanchez
          or something.
          Joel looks at his watch. It's 11:15.

                         JOEL
          Shit!
          Joel hangs up the phone, and rushes out the door.

          INT. RECEPTIONIST DESK IN FRONT OF JOEL'S OFFICE --


                         CONTINUOUS ACTION
          Brian walks in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         BRIAN

                         (CONCERNED)
          Joel, we gotta talk.

                         JOEL
          Not now Brian.

                         BRIAN
          Ah yeah, it's kind of important --
          kind of really important. It's

                         ABOUT STEP-
          Joel rushes past him.

                         JOEL
          Not now!
          We FOLLOW Joel as he rushes past his SECRETARY.

                         SECRETARY
          Excuse me Joel? There's a Brad
          Chavez on line one for you.

                         JOEL
          I can't, I--
          Joel stops suddenly.

                         JOEL
          Who?

                         SECRETARY
          Brad Chavez. He said he's done
          with the job you guys talked about
          at your house? Do you want me to
          take a message?
          Joel looks pale.

                          JOEL
           Um, no... He's the ah, pool
           cleaner. I better take that.
          Joel goes back in his office. HOLD on Brian, confused.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel stares at the phone for a beat then picks it up.

                         JOEL
          Hello?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Hey, is this Joel?

                         JOEL
          Yes.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Hey, it's Brad. Mission
          accomplished dude.

                         JOEL
          What do you mean?

          BRAD (V.0.)
          I mean it worked. She totally went
          for it.

                         JOEL
          What? What're you...?
          (looks at his watch)
          You weren't even supposed to be
          there for another 45 minutes.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Oh really? I forgot what time you
          guys said, and I was so excited
          about it, I just went over there.
          Joel sits down, freaked out.

                         JOEL
          (reality setting in)
          So you mean she actually ah... you
          guys...?

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Yup. It was easy.

                         JOEL

                         (AGITATED)
          Easy? What do you mean "easy"?

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Oh, I don't mean easy like she was
          easy -- like she was a slut or
          anything. I just mean it wasn't
          hard to get her to... Never mind.

                         JOEL
          No. Tell me. Tell me how it
          happened.

                         (BRACES HIMSELF)
          I wanna hear everything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         BRAD
          You sure?

                         JOEL
          Yeah.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Okay. Well, she let me in, so I
          went back like I was cleaning the
          pool...

          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY

           As Brad's dopey narration continues, we see the story he's
           telling. It plays out like a bad soft-porn flick on Cinemax.
           We see Brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag.

           BRAD (V.0.)
           .I don't know anything about pool
           cleaning, so I was just faking it.
           She was in her bathing suit...
          Suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs.

           BRAD (V.0.)
          .So I struck up a conversation...

                         BRAD
          This is a really nice house.

                         SUZIE
          Thanks.

                         BRAD
          Is it your Dad's house?

                         SUZIE
          No. It's ours.

                         BRAD
          Wow, you look so young to be living
          in a house this nice.

                         SUZIE
          Oh, thanks.
          Beat.

                         BRAD
          Do you have any sunscreen? I
          forgot mine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          Brad's dopey narration comes back in...

          BRAD (V.0.)
          I thought that was pretty smart
          of me -- to ask her to borrow
          sunscreen. See, 'cuz that way,
          once she gave me some, I could ask
          her if she wanted some too, and rub
          some on her back, instead of just
          coming out and asking her to rub
          some on her. Pretty smooth huh?...
          We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie's back as she lies face-
          down on the chair.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on
          her, the rest was easy...
          We see Brad's hands working their way down Suzie's back.
          Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel
          interrupts, YANKING US OUT OF THE FLASHBACK.

                         JOEL
          Okay that's enough! Stop!

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS


                         JOEL
          I don't need to hear anymore.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Okay, cool. Hey, like I say, if
          you know of anyone else, or if you
          ever need me to do it again--

                         JOEL
          NO! No. Look, I gotta go. Bye.
          Joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair, in a
          state of shock.

                         JOEL
          (quietly, to himself)
          Holy shit.

          INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

          Joel drives home from work. He still looks freaked out. He
          notices something ahead, and suddenly SLAMS ON THE BREAKS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         JOEL
          Dammit !
          JOEL'S POV: Nathan, the guy across the street is in his front
          yard, puttering around with the mail.

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          No... not today...
           Joel puts the car in reverse, starts to pull behind a parked
           car in an attempt to hide, but Nathan notices him, waves and
           crosses the street. Joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his
          driveway.

                         NATHAN
          How's it goin'?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I'm kind of busy actually.

                         NATHAN
          Yeah. Well I won't keep you. I
          just wanted to let you know, I got
          those tickets to that dinner we
          talked about on the 7th. I think I
          told you they were forty dollars a
          piece, but it turns out it's a tad
          more this year -- fifty-five -- so
          if I could go ahead and just get a
          check from you guys...

                         JOEL
          Look, ah, we can't go. Remember?

                         NATHAN
          No, this is the 7th. You said
          you're going out of town on the
          17th.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, but remember, I told you we
          didn't really want to go to this
          thing.
          Nathan looks dumbfounded. Joel is about to snap.

                         NATHAN
          But I already bought the tickets.
          I know you said something about her
          feeling uncomfortable, but, like I
          say, she won't feel uncomfortable
          at all -- I guarantee it.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         47

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          It's just a whole lot of fun. You
          guys'll have a great time.

                         JOEL
          Look, I gotta get going.

                         NATHAN
          Alright then...
          Joel starts to pull away.

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Oh, one more thing --
          Joel just keeps driving, almost knocking Nathan over.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Joel and Suzie are eating dinner. Suzie has a glow about
          her, looking better than ever -- relaxed, satisfied, etc.
          Joel's has a quietly pissed off demeanor. They eat in
          silence for a beat.

                         SUZIE
          So... How's work?

                         JOEL
          It sucks.

                         SUZIE
          Really? What's wrong?

                         JOEL
          Nothing.
          Suzie looks a little puzzled. They keep eating in silence
          for a beat.

                         JOEL
          I don't feel well. I'm going to
          bed.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          From the window in his office, Joel watches Cindy working
          down on the production floor. Cindy looks up, they make eye
          contact for a brief moment. She gives him a flirtacious wave.
          Joel waves back. Then Rory comes by, starts talking to
          Cindy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT /MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINOUS


                         CINDY
          So you're in a band?

                         RORY
          .Actually, I'm in five bands
          right now. But Godscock is
          basically the same four guys as
          Fighthead, but Fighthead's more of
          a thrash/skatepunk thing. Godscock
          is more melodic stuff.
          Cindy nods politely. Rory thinks she's interested.

                         RORY (CONT'D)
          So you comin' Friday?

                         CINDY
          Yeah, definitely.
          (looks at her watch)
          Ooh, I gotta go. Dentist
          appointment.

                         RORY
          Cool.
          Cindy leaves.
          ANGLE ON Mary, on the other side of the room, watching them.
          She talks to Gabriella.

                         MARY
          See, there he goes again, slowing
          us down.

                         (RE: CINDY)
          Now she's a good sorter. They need
          to hire more people like her.

                         GABRIELLA
          She's so nice too.
          Hector walks by. Mary just shakes her head.

                         MARY
          I can't believe he's still working
          here. You know Silvia can't find
          her wallet. Thinks it was stolen.
          And guess who was in the locker
          room last? Hector.
          They both look at Hector and shake their heads in disgust.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         MARY
          You know, I could get a job at
          Southwest Airlines. My Niece works
          there. I'd get better benefits
          than we get here too.

                         GABRIELLE
          Mmm hmm. I could get a job at
          Gemco. You think they would put up
          with this stuff at Gemco? Mmm mmn.
          They run a tight ship.

                         MARY
          That's right.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Joel's POV of Mary and Gabrielle, yacking self-righteously.
          Joel looks on with disgust...

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Good riddance...
          Brian steps in, taps on the door.

                         BRIAN
          You got a second? I think we might
          have a big problem here. I'm not
          sure what happened, but all of the
          sudden Step says he doesn't want to
          settle anymore. I think he
          might've talked to a lawyer.
          Joel goes to his desk, sits down.

                         BRIAN
          Like I say, General Mills isn't
          going to make their offer official
          until this settles.
          Joel considers this.

                         JOEL
          I think Step is just chest-beating.
          He does this all the time. He gets
          all wound up, talks big, then he
          always backs down. And that's with
          his balls.

          INT. PAROLE OFFICE - AFTERNOON

          It's a bleak looking office with rows of cubicles. We PAN
          past several cubicles where hardass parole officers meet with
          their parolees -- various gang-bangers, drug dealers,
          junkies, a hideous transvestite prostitute, etc. As we pan,
          each officer is giving them nothing -- "this is your last
          chance," "You expect me to believe that?", etc. We continue
          past officers giving them nothing, giving them nothing,
          ending on a cubicle with Cindy, where a PAROLE OFFICER is
          giving Cindy everything -- almost apologetic.

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          I'm sorry to even bring this up,
          but you're not living with the drug
          dealer anymore are you?
          Cindy's parole officer is a sad schlub of a guy, about 50
          with bushy grey hair and a mustache, he has a badge and a gun
          on his belt.

                         CINDY
          Nope. I'm staying at Extended Stay
          until I can find a place...
          She smiles, flirtatiously waves her key/card.

                         CINDY (CONT'D)
          See?

                         (SINCERE)
          I really feel like I've turned my
          life around. Thanks in large part
          to you.

                         PAROLE OFFICER

                         (ALMOST BLUSHING)
          It's okay. I'm just glad to see
          you're doing so well... Ah, one
          more thing I just need to ask you:
          We had a little incident up in
          Templeton a couple weeks back where
          someone stole an expensive guitar
          from a music store? Someone who
          fit your description. You know
          anything about that?

                         CINDY
          Huh? No... I was probably at work
          that day.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          Look Cindy, you realize you can't
          screw up anymore right? I mean,
          even something minor, and you could
          go back to jail for a while this
          time. I'd hate to see that happen.

                         CINDY
          Well yeah, but why would I steal a
          guitar? I've got no musical
          talent. I'm tone deaf.
          They both laugh.

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          Heh heh, So am I. I can't carry a
          tune to save my life.

                         CINDY
          Really? Wow...
          Cindy acts fascinated by Parole Officer's lack of musical
          talent. He happily goes on about it, forgetting about the
          guitar...

                         PAROLE OFFICER
          Yeah, I could barely sing the Star
          Spangled Banner in school...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - PARKING LOT - DAY

          It's the end of the workday. People walk to their cars.
          Joel turns a corner and finds Cindy right in front of him.

                         CINDY
          Hey Mr. Reynolds.

                         JOEL
          Oh, hey Cindy. You can just call
          me Joel.

                         CINDY

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          Okay Joel. So you going to the
          party tonight?

                         JOEL
          Oh yeah. Right, that's tonight...

          52.

          JOEL (CON T - D )
          Yeah, I was thinking about it. Are
          you going?

                         CINDY
          Yeah, definitely. Maybe I'll see
          you there?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I think I'll probably go.

                         CINDY
          Do you have the directions?

                         JOEL
          I'm not sure...

                         CINDY
          Here, I'll write it down just in

                         CASE
          Cindy opens her purse. We see at least FIVE WALLETS, SEVERAL
          WATCHES, JEWELRY, etc. She takes out a pen and a piece of
          pink, girly stationary and starts writing.

          I'll also put my number on here.
          In case you want to call me some
          time -- if you want.
          Joel blushes awkwardly, like a junior high school kid.

                         JOEL
          Um... Okay. Sure.

          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Joel pulls into the driveway and is STARTLED as he
          practically runs over Nathan, flagging him down.
          Joel MUTTERS obscenities as he reluctantly stops and rolls
          down the window.

                         NATHAN
          Hi there. Almost missed ya.

                         JOEL
          Hi. I can't talk right now--

                         NATHAN
          Hey, I noticed you guys got a new
          pool cleaner today. How is he?
          We're thinking of changing
          services.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         JOEL
          Look Nathan, I gotta... Wait, you
          mean yesterday, don't you?

                         NATHAN
          Huh?

                         JOEL
          The new pool cleaner. You saw him
          yesterday right? Not today.

                         NATHAN
          No. It was today. The new guy.

                         JOEL
          What'd he look like?

                         NATHAN
          Blonde haired kid, about this high,
          good looking. Real good looking.

                         IN FACT--

                         JOEL
          You sure it was today? Not
          yesterday?

                         NATHAN
          Yeah.

                         JOEL
          You're absolutely sure?

                         NATHAN
          Yeah. I know it was today, because
          I came home for lunch. I was gone
          all day yesterday. Anyway, you
          think I could go ahead and get that
           check from ya? Like I say, it's 55
           dollars a plate, so that'd be 110
           total. There's no tax...
          Nathan leans up to scratch his back. Joel seizes the
           opportunity and pulls away, burning a little rubber.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Joel is on his cell phone, yelling in hushed tones at Brad.
          He has the door shut so Suzie won't hear him.

                         JOEL
          What the hell were you doing at my
          house today?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Oh, umm... nothing.

                         JOEL
          Bullshit!

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Look, don't worry about it bro'. I
          won't charge you for this one.

                         JOEL
          Won't charge me for...? You had
          sex with my wife again?!

          BRAD (V.0.)
          Well, I figured we already did it
          once, so what's the big deal? I
          mean, she said to stop by if I was
          in the neighborhood, so... Besides,
          I'm not gonna charge you--

                         JOEL
          Not gonna charge...? God damn you!
          Yes you are gonna charge me! I'm
          gonna pay you! You're not having
          sex with my wife for free! And I
          better not ever catch you anywhere
          near my house ever again!
          Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it's a cell phone,
          picks it back up and hits the "End" button.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

          Suzie is asleep on the couch in her sweatpants. Joel walks
          through, mumbles something about going to a party.

          INT. JOEL'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Joel pulls up to the house where the party is going on. He
          stays in the car, checking it out.
          Scanning Joel's POV, we see the band, Godscock, playing in
          the backyard, with Rory on bass. They are set up on the
          patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house. Most of the
          people at the party are crowded around the keg, which is on
          the other side of the backyard, ignoring the band. The band
          sounds awful -- loud as hell, unmusical, uninspired. The
          lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style, but even
          more loud and overly dramatic. Rory acts all intense, in
          stark contrast to the non-intensity of the music.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          They all have that baggy-shorts tattooed mid-nineties look.
          It's downright pathetic.
          There's one drunk guy off to the side banging his head,
          playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes.
          Joel spots Cindy over by the keg, drinking, mingling. He
          watches her for a beat, then shakes his head and drives away.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean, drinking a beer.

                         JOEL
          I can't believe my wife slept with
          that guy.

                         DEAN
          Well... I thought you said it
          wouldn't bother you.

                         JOEL
          I guess I didn't really think about
          it long enough... I just wish it
          hadn't been so easy for him.

                         DEAN
          Yeah, I'm tellin' ya, chicks really
          go wild for that Brad...
          (Off Joel's look)
          Sorry.

                         JOEL
          No, you're right. He may be a
          stupid, dull-witted moron, but he
          can get any girl he wants. Me, I
          had to work for it. I had to work
          hard, get a career going, take
          Suzie out a bunch of times, marry
          her. But not Brad. He gets to
          waltz into my house and have sex
          with my wife just like that. Oh,
          and by the way? That little prick
          was at my house again today.

                         DEAN
          No shit? What was he doing?

                         JOEL
          Take a wild guess.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         DEAN
          Wow... You pay a guy to do a job,
          then he comes back and does it for
          free.

                         JOEL
          I'm not going to let him do it for
          free. No way. I'm paying him.

                         DEAN
          Really? How much?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I don't know. The same, I
          guess. Why?

                         DEAN
          Hmm... So should I get my twenty
          dollars from Brad then or...
          Joel shoots Dean an angry look.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
          We can worry about that later...
          Look at the bright side, now you
          can call Cindy.

                         JOEL
          I don't know... I feel weird about
          it. Besides, she's at the party,
          she probably won't be home 'til
          late.

                         DEAN
          You know what you need to do?

                         JOEL
          (rolling his eyes)
          I don't wanna do drugs Dean.

                         DEAN
          Look, I know I joke around a lot,
          but this time I'm serious.
          (like a doctor)
          You should try smoking a little
          pot. It's just an herb, it heals.
          Stress can kill you, and--

                         JOEL
          I get paranoid when I smoke pot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         DEAN
          Not when you just smoke a little.
          Come on. You ever meet my friend
          Willie? Great guy. Really great
          guy.
          (as if it's a positive)
          He's the guy I got that horse
          tranquilizer from.

                         JOEL
          Oh, wonderful.

          INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          WILLIE loads up some kind of giant three-foot tall bong and
          inhales a massive bong-load. He's a burly ex-football player
          type who looks like he might have an extra y-chromosome or
          two. Joel watches Willie, feeling a little uneasy. Dean
          pontificates.

                         DEAN
          I've been reading about it --
          they're making technological
          advances now, coming up with great
          drugs that can make you happy and
          won't leave you with a hangover or
          nothin'.

                         WILLIE
          (holding in bong-hit)
          Right on.
          Willie finally exhales. The exhale seems to go on way longer
          than humanly possible, endless amounts of pot-smoke billowing
          out (accomplished with special FX). He finally hands the
          bong and lighter to Joel.

                         JOEL
          Oh, I don't know... I'm kind of a
          light weight. I think that's too
          much for me--

                         WILLIE
          (still holding out the
          bong and lighter)
          Bullshit.

                         DEAN
          Come on Joel. Don't worry, this
          stuff isn't that strong.
          (to Willie, re: Joel)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

          DEAN (CON T-D)
          He gets paranoid when he gets too
          stoned.
          Joel looks at Willie then at Dean, then takes the bong,
          partly out of being intimidated by Willie.

                         JOEL
          Ah, what the hell.
          Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same
          condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would.

                         WILLIE
          Okay, now this is a gravity bong.
          Have you ever used one before?

                         JOEL
          Umm, I think... no.

                         WILLIE
          Okay, pay attention. Put your
          thumb right here on the carburetor.
          When I pull the plunger up and say,
          "let go" I want you to let go and
          inhale hard.
          Joel's POV: Looking down the barrel of the three-foot bong
          with macho-man Willie holding the lighter at the bowl.

                         WILLIE (CONT'D)
          Okay exhale!

                         JOEL
          You know, maybe I should just let

                         YOU GUYS--

                         WILLIE
          (starting to get scary)
          Bullshit! EXHALE HARD!
          Mostly out of fear, Joel exhales. Willie puts the bong up to
          Joel's face, lights it and starts lifting the plunger. Then
          pushes it down.

                         WILLIE (CONT'D)
          Let go! Inhale! NOW!
          Joel lets go of the carburator, inhales.

                         WILLIE (CONT'D)

                         (INSANE)

          GO! GO! HARDER!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          Joel inhales with all his might, sucking up massive amounts
          of thick pot smoke as Willie pushes down the plunger.

                         STONER-RIPPLE

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          WILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
          Willie, Dean and Joel sitting around, completely baked --
          especially Joel. (We play most of the scene from Joel's
          stoned, paranoid POV.)
          Dean makes some kind of barely audible mumble -- or did he?

                         JOEL
          What?
          Long pause.

                         DEAN
          Huh?
          Joel's POV: looking from Dean to Willie. Willie sits there
          with red eyes barely open. Willie turns slowly to Joel.

                         WILLIE
          Huh?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I thought somebody said
          something.
          Willie looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to
          Joel's paranoia. He stares at Joel for a long beat. Then,
          in an instant, he's right up in Joel's face.

                         WILLIE

          BWAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
          Joel jumps back, scared shitless. Willie starts laughing his
          ass off.

                         WILLIE
          Haaaah ha... The look on your face!

                         (INSANE CACKLE)
          Man you really do get paranoid when
          you get stoned.

                         JOEL
          (fake, timid laugh)
          Yeah, heh heh...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         DEAN
          Hey Joel, why don't you call that
          chick now?

                         JOEL
          What time is it?

                         WILLIE
          Time for you to call her and
          finally get laid man!
          (handing him the phone)
          Come on!

                         DEAN
          It's twelve thirty. She might be
          back by now.

                         JOEL
          Alright.
          Joel gets the phone number out of his pocket.

                         WILLIE
          So what's this chick look like?

                         JOEL
          Oh, she's got brown hair. Pretty
          hot. Kind of working-class
          looking...

                         WILLIE
          What do you mean by that?
           Willie stares at Joel for a beat. Joel can't tell if he's
          offended Willie or not.

                         JOEL
          Umm... Oh you know,...

                         WILLIE
          Is she kind of slutty lookin'?

                         JOEL
          Yeah...
          Beat. Joel's not sure if that was the right answer either.

                         WILLIE
          Alright! That's how I like 'em.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         JOEL
          Yeah...

                         (UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGH)
          Kinda nasty, heh heh...
          Joel starts dialing the number.

                          JOEL (CONT'D)
          I hope I don't wake her up...

                         (LISTENS)
          It's busy.

                         DEAN
          Alright. At least you know she's
          home.

                         JOEL
          Yeah.

                         WILLIE
          Try her again. Come on.
          Joel hits redial.

                         JOEL
          Still busy... Man, what kind of
          person doesn't have call-waiting.

                         WILLIE
          I don't have call-waiting. I hate
          call-waiting. Every time I hear
          that goddamn clicking sound, I
          wanna put my fist through someone's
          head.
          Beat. Once again, Joel doesn't know whether to shit or wind
          his watch. Willie stares at him, then

                         WILLIE
          Haaa ha! Man you really do get
          paranoid when you're stoned...
          Seriously though, I fuckin' hate
          call-waiting.

                         JOEL

                         (NERVOUS CHUCKLE)
          Yeah...
          Willie grabs the phone.

                         WILLIE
          Here let me dial. You're too
          stoned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          Willie grabs the piece of paper with Cindy's number. He
          looks at it, starts to dial, then pauses, realizing
          something.
          Willie looks up at Joel, with slowly building rage, then
          hangs up the phone.

                         WILLIE
          I'll tell you why you're getting a
          busy signal. This is my number.

                         JOEL
          Huh? But...
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          Oh... You're joking right? Trying
          to make me paranoid?
          Joel waits for Willie to start cracking up. He doesn't. He
          just continues glaring at Joel. We hear the FRONT DOOR
          UNLOCK. Everyone looks.
          CINDY enters.

                         CINDY
          Hi. Sorry I'm late, I...

                         (NOTICING JOEL)
          Joel? What are you doing here...?
          Willie stands up and walks over to Joel's chair. Dean
          suddenly stands up.

                         DEAN
          Well, it looks like you guys got a
          lot to talk about here so I think
          I'm just gonna go ahead and take
          off. Later guys.
          Dean bolts. Willie moves in closer on Joel. Joel starts to
          leave, but Willie blocks him.

                         WILLIE
          Kinda slutty?
          Willie grabs Joel and throws him against the wall. Joel
          tries to make a break for the door, but Willie hauls off and
          punches him across the face. The ass-kicking begins as we

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Joel limps into the house, his face bruised black and blue
           from the ass-kicking. He looks awful.
           As he limps into the bedroom as quietly as possible, he trips
           on something, waking up Suzie. She turns on a light and sees
          Joel.

                         SUZIE
          Oh my God Joel, are you alright?
          What happened?

                         JOEL
          I'm fine. I'm fine. I just ah...
          got my ass kicked. Go back to
          sleep.

                         SUZIE
          What? By who? What happened?

                         JOEL
          It was just... some guy over at
          Scoreboards.

                         SUZIE
          Let me drive you to the hospital.
          You need to get checked out.

                         JOEL
          No. I'll be fine. I just want to
          sleep right now, okay?

                         SUZIE
          You sure you're okay? It looks
          like your nose is broken, and your

                         EYE--

                         JOEL

                         (AGITATED)
          Don't worry about it! People get
          their asses kicked all the time!
          It's no big deal. Go back to
          sleep.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - MORNING

          Joel walks past his Secretary.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         SECRETARY
          Hi Joel. Brian wanted to see you--

                         (NOTICING)
          Oh my God, what happened?
          Joel keeps walking, MUMBLES something about falling down some
          stairs, goes into his office and shuts the door.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

          Joel walks over to the window overlooking the production
          area. He looks down and sees Cindy working, with her back
          turned. Shakes his head.
          Brian KNOCKS on the door and enters, looking worried.

                         BRIAN
          Hi... Did you talk to Step yet?

                         JOEL
          He isn't returning my calls.

                         BRIAN
          Shit... We've got problems. He did
          hire a lawyer -- Joe Adler -- he's
          that personal injury lawyer you see
          on all the bus-stop benches. You
          oughtta see this guy. He's a real
          piece of shi--
          (noticing Joel's face)
          Oh man, what happened to you?

                         JOEL
          Oh, I fell down some stairs.

                         BRIAN
          Damn... Well anyway, I hate to say
          this, but I think we're screwed.
          There's no way this Adler guy is
          gonna settle for anything less then
          bankrupting us. Says he'll sue us
          into the stone age.

                         JOEL
          (clutches his head

                         MISERABLE)
          Shit... I gotta talk to Step.
          Brian looks at Joel's bruised face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         BRIAN
          Man, everyone's getting hurt.
          Cindy came in with a black eye
          today. You hear how she got it?

                         JOEL
          Ah... no.

                         BRIAN
          Step did it. Can you believe that?

                         JOEL
          No he--!

                         (CATCHES HIMSELF)
          What? Where did you hear that?

                         BRIAN
          That's what she told Mary.

                         JOEL
          But... Step? Does he even know
          her?

                         BRIAN
          Apparently they've been going out.

                         JOEL
          What?!

                         BRIAN
          I know, it's weird. They didn't
          even meet here. They met at a
          grocery store or something. Just a
          total coincidence.
          Joel looks down at Cindy on the production floor, his mind
          reeling.

                         BRIAN
          Anyway, we're gonna have to hire a
          couple of new people because

                         CINDY'S QUITTING--

                         JOEL
          Really?

                         BRIAN
          Yep. And if it's okay with you,
          I'd like to go ahead and fire
          Hector.

                         JOEL
          Fire Hector? What for?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         BRIAN
          You know, Mary's purse? Sylvia's
          wallet? It's gotta be him. Who
          else could it be?
          Joel looks down at Cindy with growing suspicion.

                         JOEL
          No. Don't fire him. Just trust me
          on this. Give him another week.
          If anything else is stolen, then
          you can fire him.

                         BRIAN

                         (PUZZLED)
          Alright. If you say so.
          Brian looks Joel over.

                         BRIAN (CONT'D)
          Man, are you okay? Have you seen a
          doctor?
          Joel's Secretary BEEPS in.

          SECRATARY (V.0.)
          Joel, Dean is on line one for you.

                         JOEL
          Okay, thanks.

                         (TO BRIAN)
          I better get this.
          Brian leaves.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Hello.

                         DEAN
          Hey man. Sorry I bailed on you
          like that last night. It's just
          that I don't like to get involved
          in other people's personal shit,
          you know what I mean?

                         JOEL
          Uh-huh.

                         DEAN
          I didn't even know Willie had a
          girlfriend. She must be new. Man,
          Willie looked pissed.

                         (CHUCKLES)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          DEAN (CON T'D)
          I thought he was gonna take a swing
          at you there for a second.

                         JOEL
          He did take a swing at me Dean.
          Several swings. In fact, he beat
          the living shit out of me.

                         DEAN
          Whoa, really?

                         JOEL
          Yes.

                         DEAN
          Wow. Man, that really goes to show
          you -- this town is smaller than
          you think. You really gotta be
          careful.
          Joel hangs up and walks out of his office, past his
          Secretary.

                         JOEL
          I'm not feeling well. I'm going to
          go home early.

          INT. JOEL'S CAR -- DAY

          Joel turns the corner to his house and does a double-take as
          he sees BRAD'S TRUCK going the opposite direction.

                         JOEL
          Shit!
          Joel slams on the brakes, turns around, chases Brad's truck
          down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop. They both get out
          of their vehicles. Joel is livid.

                         JOEL
          What the hell were you doing on my
          street again?!

                         BRAD
          Dude, you weren't supposed to be
          home for another four hours--
          Whoa, what happened to your face?

                         JOEL
          (trying to improvise a
          tough, snappy comeback,
          but can't quite make it

                         WORK)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          The same thing that's gonna
          happen.. Your face is gonna look
          worse if... GOD DAMMIT! If I ever
          catch you anywhere near my house or
          my wife again, I'll have you
          arrested.

                         BRAD
          For what? Suzie let me in.
          Joel is stumped -- Brad actually has a point.

                         JOEL
          What the hell is wrong with you
          anyway? Do you do this with all
          your clients -- just keep coming
          back and hanging around?

                         BRAD
          I don't know. This is my first
          one.

                         JOEL
          What?! I thought you were a
          professional!

                         BRAD
          Look man, I know she's your wife
          an' shit, but you might as well
          know -- I think we're in love.

                         JOEL
          In love?!

                         (COMING UNGLUED)
          HA! Man are you stupid. You are
          so goddamn dumb. You think she
          loves you? You're nothing but a
          piece of ass to her. That's all.

                         BRAD
          I don't think so dude.

                         JOEL
          Oh, you don't think so "dude?"
          Well did you ever think about this:
          she doesn't even know that I paid
          you to have sex with her -- did
          that cross your small mind?

                         BRAD
          Uuh..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         JOEL
          How about I go home right now and
          tell her? Tell her you did it for
          the money. How about that loverboy?
          Brad suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out.

                         BRAD
          You wouldn't do that.

                         JOEL
          You don't think so? Watch me.

                         BRAD
          (realizing he's serious)
           No... Dude, please don't. Please?
          Joel starts back to his car.

                         BRAD
          Look man, we really have a special
          thing going on. Please don't mess
          it up...
          Joel stops.

                         JOEL
          Don't mess it up?! You're talking
          about my wife! My house! Stupid-
          ass!
          Joel gets in his car and starts it.

                         BRAD
          (calls out to him)
          Dude, you can't do this to me.

                         JOEL
          Oh yes I can...
          Joel peels out, drives half a block and turns into his
          driveway.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Joel walks in, still pissed off. Suzie is sitting on the
          couch, a little surprised to see him.

                         SUZIE
          Oh hi. You're home early.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         JOEL

                         (COLD)
          Hi.
          Joel walks over to the sliding glass door, looks outside at
          the pool. It's filthy.

                         JOEL
          So how was that new pool cleaner?
           Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but
          she plays it cool.

                         SUZIE
          Um... What do you mean?

                         JOEL
          What do you think I mean?... Did
          he do a good job cleaning the pool?

                         SUZIE
          Ah... well--

                         JOEL
          Did he get all the... leaves? It
          doesn't really look that clean. I
          mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say
          it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the
          guy even clean it at all? It sure
          doesn't look like it.

                         SUZIE

                         (NERVOUS)
          Well yeah, I guess he didn't do a
          very good job.

                         JOEL
          I think he did a horrible job. I
          don't think we should use him
          anymore.

                         SUZIE
          Okay.

                         JOEL
          Okay.
          Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look of guilt on her face.

                         SUZIE
          Are you all right, Joel? You want
          an aspirin or anything?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         JOEL
          No.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Quick shot of Joel staring up at the ceiling shaking his
          head, can't believe all this.

          EXT. STEP'S HOUSE -- NEXT DAY

           In a WIDE SHOT we see Joel's car is parked on the street. He
           walks up and rings the doorbell. We see Step answer, talk to
          him and then invite him in.

          INT. STEP'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

          Step and Joel enter. Step's 300 POUND HALF-BROTHER sits on a
          ratty couch watching TV, drinking a huge plastic bottle of
          Pepsi. He looks like he's been sitting there for years. The
          TV is deafeningly loud.

                         STEP
          Wow, I don't think you've ever been
          to my house before. Have you?

                         JOEL
          (talking above the TV)
          Yeah, I don't think so. I would've
          remembered...

                         STEP
          This is my half brother Phil.
          Joel starts to motion "don't get up," then realizes that's
          not happening anyway. Phil nods.

                         JOEL
          Hi... Hey Step, can we talk in
          another room.

                         STEP
          Sure, let's go out back.

          EXT. STEP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- A LITTLE LATER

          Joel and Step sit at a picnic table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         STEP
          You know, my lawyer told me not to
          talk to you.

                         (BEAT)
          You're not here to try to talk me
          out of suing are you?

                         JOEL
          Oh, no... No, I'm just kind of
          curious about... ah... So you've
          been going out with Cindy, huh?

                         STEP
          Yes sir. She's my girlfriend. We
          might even get married after all
          this lawsuit-settlement stuff gets
          worked out.

                         JOEL
          .so some of the guys at work are
          saying you gave Cindy that black
          eye.

                         STEP
          What? That ain't true at all.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I know it's not.

                         STEP
          She got it from falling down some
          stairs.

                         JOEL
          Hmm... Look, you might wanna be
          careful with Cindy.

                         STEP

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          What do you mean?

                         JOEL
          Well, I'm not sure how to put this,
          but... You know, you got a lot of
          money coming your way with this
          settlement. You might wanna be

                         CAREFUL--

                         STEP
          Oh no. No, she didn't even know
          about that 'til after we started
          going out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         JOEL
          You sure about that?

                         STEP
          Oh yeah. I didn't tell her about
          it for a while 'cuz I was kind of
          embarrassed, you know? You don't
          tell a girl you just met that you
          lost one of your balls. Especially
          a girl as hot as Cindy.

                         JOEL
          Yeah...

                         (DELICATELY)
          You know she lives with this guy
          Willie right?

                         STEP
          That's her ex. She broke up with
          him. She's gonna move out. She
          just needs to get all her stuff
          outta there.

                         JOEL
          You sure about that?

                         STEP
          Oh yeah. She's moving in with me.

                         JOEL
          Oh. Hmm...

                         STEP
          Look, I know Cindy's got some
          problems, but she means well.
          She's the best thing that ever
          happened to me.

                         JOEL
          Well, okay... If you say so.
          Another thing -- you just might
          want to watch your back. Some of
          the guys at work who think you gave
          Cindy the black eye were talking
          about paying you a visit -- you
          know, getting even.

                         STEP
          Oh. Well I'm not worried about
          that.
          (dead-serious, proud)
          I could kick anyone's ass at that
          whole company.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - DAY

           Brad and Suzie are by the pool which is filthy. Brad starts
          coming on to Suzie. She pushes him away.

                         SUZIE
          No Brad, we can't. I'm sorry, but
          we have to stop doing this.

                         BRAD
          Why?

                         SUZIE
          It's not right. I feel horrible.
          Besides, I think Joel's getting
          suspicious. And you gotta start
          cleaning the pool too.

                         BRAD
          But I've never felt this way about
          anyone before. And I've been with
          a lot of chicks.

                         SUZIE

                         (TURNED OFF)
          Uh-huh... Look Brad, the truth is
          I love my husband. I really do.
          This was all a big mistake. I'm
          sorry. I don't know what got into
          me, but we have to stop this. I
          want to make my marriage work
          again. I'm going to tell Joel
          about the whole thing and just hope
          he forgives me. And even if he
          doesn't, at least I won't be
          carrying around this horrible
          feeling. I just can't stand that
          he doesn't know.

                         BRAD
          Uh... This doesn't mean we can't
          still see each other though, right?

                         SUZIE
          Ah, yes it does.

                         BRAD
          Why?

                         SUZIE
          Because of all the things I just
          said.

                         (MORE)

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)

                         (PATIENTLY)
          Do you need me to say them again?

                         BRAD
          Can I see you tomorrow?

                         SUZIE
          No.

                         BRAD

                         (PLEADING)
          How about next week?

                         SUZIE
          No. Look, you gotta go Brad. Joel
          could be home any second.

                         BRAD
          I'll call you tomorrow.

                         SUZIE
          (just trying to get rid of

                         HIM)
          Okay. Okay, just go and we'll talk
          later.
          Brad leans to kiss her, she pushed him away and he finally
          leaves.

                         SUZIE

                         (TO HERSELF)
          God, what a moron.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          Joel sits deep in his chair, bummed out, staring down at the
          manufacturing area. Brian walks in.

                         BRIAN
          So... you ready?

                         JOEL
          Huh?

                         BRIAN
          The meeting with Step's lawyer. Or
          lawyers I should say. It's today
          remember?

                         JOEL
          Oh shit... Alright.
          Joel drags himself out of the chair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - DAY

          JOE ADLER, is holding court with the various lawyers and
          paralegals waiting for the meeting to start. As promised, he
          is awful. He looks like Henry Winkler with an extra Y
          chromosome and a lot of steroids. (Maybe cast Gene Simmons
          with his hair pulled back in a pony tail.)

                         ADLER
          .You see, if both his balls had
          been knocked clean off, he would be
          a good case, but not a great case:
          A man with no balls is no man at
          all. He's a freak. He's barely
          human. He's gross. And a jury will
          never feel like they can walk in
          the shoes of a ball-less, neutered,
          he/she freak. But Step. He's
          still got one ball - barely. He's
          still a man. A man who's very
          manhood has been jeopardized, but
          still a man. And that manhood,
          that very sense of what you are as
          a human being is hanging by a
          thread. Jesus, you can't get more
          dramatic than that. That brave
          ball, hanging on for dear life,
          hanging on for justice, is going to
          be the hero of this trial. I'm
          tellin' ya this Step guy is the
          fuckin' Holy Grail, the Powerball
          Jackpot. And you all laughed at me
          when I bought those bus bench ads.
          But I knew the asses of those poor
          slobs that sit on those benches and
          ride those sweaty, stinking, cattle
          cars are our future. And I --
          Joel and Brian walk in.

                         ADLER
          Oh, hello. I'm Joe Adler...
          Everybody starts introducing each other.

          It's bullshit man. We should get a

          Gabrielle and I work harder than
          anybody. I should be making what

          a day. Minimum.

          That's right. Here he's gonna make

          That's why what we should do is, is
          we should all go on strike --
          demand stock in the company before
          it sells. If General Mills knew
          we were on strike, they wouldn't
          buy this place until the strike was
          over. That way they'd have to give
          us stock.
          Jim points to his head, gives everyone a "how's that" nod.
          It starts to build steam.

                         RORY
          That's right man. We should do it.
          We should strike.

                         MARY
          That's right. I could get a job at
          Gemco like that. At Gemco, all the
          employees are owners -- even says
          so on the name tags.

                         GABRIELLE
          Mmm hmm. I could get a job at
          Southwest Airlines...

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - DAY

          The meeting is already in progress. On Adler's side of the
          table are two other lawyers and a couple of paralegals. On
          Joel's side it's just he, Brian and Joel's secretary. Maybe
          one lawyer who doesn't say much.
          Everybody has in front of them a small stack of documents.
          The confrence room, like Joel's office, has a full length
          window facing the manufacturing area.

                         ADLER
          Ok gentlemen. We've gone through
          everything and the only way we
          would even begin to consider a
          settlement would be to the tune of
          the number you see on the bottom of
          page 18. Does everyone have this?
           Joel and the rest of them find page 18. Joel is stunned by
          the number.

                         JOEL
          What!!!?
          (so pissed he can barely
          get the words out)
          We don't have this much money! Not
          even close!

                         ADLER
          Not in cash you don't. Of course
          not. But if you were to sell off
          your assets: the property lease,
          the equipment, the--

                         JOEL
          What the ff-- Are you shitting
          me!? That would bankrupt us!

                         BRIAN
          This is what I've been trying to
          tell you Joel...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         JOEL
          If you think I'm just going to give
          up this entire company that I built
          from the ground up--
          Adler jumps up, dripping with phoney, forced indignation.

                         ADLER
          How about what my client gave up!?
          His testicles! How about that!?
          He walks over to the door...

                         ADLER
          In fact, I'll make a deal with you -
          - we will drop this case right now
          if you come over here and put your
          testicles right here
          (indicates the space
          between the door and the

                         HINGES)
          and let me slam this door like
          this...
          Adler SLAMS the door ridiculously hard.

                         ADLER
          Go ahead. We can settle this right
          now -- call it even. I will drop
          this case right now if you let me
          slam your balls in this door,

          BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY

          CLIENT!

                         JOEL
          It was an accident!

                         ADLER
          Not according to our investigation.
          We believe that, in fact, there was
          gross negligence...

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          The employees, same ones in the breakroom, are milling
          around, talking, the idea of the strike gaining momentum.
          Rory points up to the confrence room.

                         RORY
          I heard those guys up there are the
          guys from General Mills.

          Employees' POV: Adler pacing around, yelling, Joel yelling
          back, etc. [They can't hear any of it.]

                         MARY
          Mmm hmm...

                         JIM
          See, now they're probably up there
          negotiating right now -- cuttin' up
          the pie that we baked. That's what
          it looks like to me.
          The employees all nod in agreement.
          Employees POV: Adler pointing at his balls, pointing to the
          door again, about to slam it. One of his lawyers stops him.

                         RORY
          We gotta act fast. They could be
          about to close the deal.

                         JIM
          Yeah, and leave us out in the cold.

                         RORY
          Yeah, then it's too late. If
          they've already sold it we can't
          get a piece of it. We gotta act
          fast. We need to do one of those
          walk outs.

                         JIM
          Well, we better do it now.

                         RORY
          Okay, who's in? We need a show of
          force. Come on, it's now or
          never...
          We PAN around the employees as the idea builds momentum,
          ending on HECTOR, who looks completely confused by it all.

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          The meeting heats up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         ADLER
          Okay then, let me go back to my
          previous offer: I will gladly come
          down on that price -- I'll come all
          the way down to zero and drop this
          case -- if you go over there right
          now and slam your testicles in that
          door! Because--

                         JOEL
          I don't wanna slam my testicles in
          the door! I want you to be
          reasonable! You won't even budge
          one penny! Come on!

                         ADLER
          Like I say, if you slam your--

                         JOEL
          I'll slam your balls in the door!

                         ADLER
          I'm sorry, did you just threaten
          me?
          Brian puts his hand on Joel, motions him to calm down.

                         BRIAN
          Look, we need to cool off a minute.
          We'll be right back.
          Brian leads Joel out of the room.

          HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

                         JOEL
          I don't need this. I'm going home.

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          Joel walks down the stairs. The group of employees see him
          and ready themselves for the big confrontation. Joel notices
          them all looking at him and stops.

                         JOEL
          Yeah?... What?
          But they are ill-prepared. No one knows who should talk
          first. It's incredibly awkward. They all look at each other
          and mutter things like, "go ahead" "you first". Finally...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         RORY
          Umm... We were just uh...

                         JIM
          Well, Rory was talking about how
          you guys are doing this deal with
          General Mills and we just think
          that ah... We were considering the
          idea of ah...

                         RORY
          Well, we just think that we should
          maybe get a piece of it, you know
          cuz we do all the work... And if we
          don't... um...
          Joel's in no mood for this. He goes off on them.

                         JOEL
          You know what? Fine. Fine.
          You're all in charge -- all of you.
          (gestures to all the

                         EMPLOYEES)
          As of now. You run the goddamn
          place. Go ahead. In fact, you can
          go up there right now and meet with
          Adler. He may slam your balls in
          the door, but woohoo! You're the
          boss!
          Joel storms out, leaving the employees standing there.
          A BICKERING MATCH erupts over who was supposed to do the
          talking, who said they would say what, who backed down first,
          etc. "I was gonna say something but you interrupted," "You
          didn't say anything when he was leaving, so I thought you
          were quitting. I would've stood up to him."
          As the argument dies down, one by one they all go back to
          their posts, muttering.

          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

          Joel is sitting at the table, picking at some food, looking
          miserable. Suzie comes over, gathers up her nerve.

                         SUZIE
          Listen Joel, there's something I
          have to tell you. I think we need
          to be honest with each other.
          Suzie sits down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          I'm not sure how to say this, but --
          well, you've been so caught up in
          you're work lately, and I'm here
          alone all day and sometimes I just--

                         JOEL
          You banged the pool cleaner.

                         SUZIE
          Wha...
          Suzie is stunned.

                         JOEL
          That's what you're trying to tell
          me right? You had sex with Brad?

                         SUZIE
          You knew?

                         JOEL
          Yes I knew. I hired him.

                         SUZIE
          Well I know you hired him, but how
          did you know about--

                         JOEL
          I don't mean I hired him to clean
          the pool, I mean I hired him to
          have sex with you.

                         SUZIE
          What?

                         JOEL
          He's a gigolo Suzie.
          Suzie is stupefied.

                         SUZIE
          But... what... Why?
          Joel is so fed up, he just tells her everything.

                         JOEL
          I hired him to have an affair with
          you so that I could have an affair
          without feeling guilty. I was
          really drunk and on some kind of
          horse tranquilizer and--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         SUZIE
          Brad was getting paid?...
          (disbelief, hurt)
          So you've been paying Brad this
          whole time? All fifteen times?!

                         JOEL
          FIFTEEN TIMES?! Jesus Christ
          Suzie!
          Joel sinks into his chair, shaking his head.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          I only paid him once -- well,
          twice. The rest was on the house.
          Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in.

                         SUZIE
          You wanted to have an affair with
          another woman?

                         JOEL
          Yes. But I didn't.
          Suzie paces around for a moment, reeling, processing all
          this. Then, decisively,

                         SUZIE
          You asshole.

                         JOEL
          Oh, I'm the asshole?

                         SUZIE
          Yes! How could you?

                         JOEL

                         (LAUGHS)
          How could I? How could you?!!!
          You didn't have to have sex with
          him. You could've simply said "No
          thanks. Just clean the pool," but
          you didn't, did you?! No, you took
          him up on his little offer and had
          sex with him -- fifteen times!

                         SUZIE
          None of this would've happened if
          you hadn't hired him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         JOEL
          Okay. I'll admit, I made a big
          mistake. I was drunk, on drugs,
          stressed, sexually frustrated and I
          shouldn't have hired a male
          prostitute to seduce you. But if
          you had simply been faithful, none
          of this would've happened.
          Suzie just looks at him for a beat.

                         SUZIE
          You're sick, you know that?
          Beat. Joel can't really argue this point.

                         JOEL
          What do you see in Brad anyway?
          He's borderline retarded. You
          probably could've been arrested for
          having sex with a guy that dumb.

                         SUZIE
          That's it. I'm leaving.
          Suzie heads for the door. Joel follows after her.

                         JOEL
          No. You're not leaving me. I'm
          leaving you!

                         SUZIE
          Fine.
          Joel opens the door, about to storm out, only to find
          NATHAN, standing right there about to ring the doorbell.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, hey guys. Glad I caught ya.
          You guys hardly ever answer the
          door. Heh heh.
          They are both so flustered, they can barely talk.

                         SUZIE
          Now's not a good time Nathan.
          Joel turns around, storms off back into the house.

                         NATHAN
          Oh, you guys goin' somewhere?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         SUZIE
          No. Look, we can't talk right now.

                         NATHAN
          Well, you think I could go ahead
          and get that check from ya then?
          I'm just trying to balance my
          checkbook here...

                         SUZIE
          Now's not a good time.

                         NATHAN
          When would be a good time, you
          think?

                         SUZIE
          I don't know.

                         NATHAN
          See the thing is--

                         SUZIE
          Okay tomorrow.

                         NATHAN
          Great, what time?

                         SUZIE
          I don't know. Just come by
          tomorrow. I can't talk now.

                         NATHAN
          Okay great. And if you could just
          go ahead and have that check,
          that'd be great. It's a hundred
          and ten. That's two plates at

                         FIFTY-FIVE--

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, Okay...
          Suzie shuts the door, cutting him off.

           EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- DAY

           Joel checks into an Extended Stay America hotel.(a chain of
          hotels that rent by the week.)
          Quick shot of Joel sitting alone in the room. He drops his
          suitcase and glumly sits down on the bed, grabs the remote.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          He turns on Spectravision and surfs the Adult titles, decides
          he's not into it and switches back to regular TV only to find
          American Idol is on. He stares at it for a beat, then flops
          down on the bed and stares at the ceiling.

          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

          Joel sits at the bar, drowning his sorrows. Dean is over by
          the cash register, tending to some business. Brad enters,
          walks over to Joel. Joel looks the other way.

                         BRAD
          Hey man... I know you probably
          want to kick my ass, but--

                         JOEL
          I couldn't kick your ass if I
          wanted to. You're a good 10 years
          younger than me, and I'm a pussy.
          So why don't you just leave me
          alone.

                         BRAD
          I just wanted to tell you, I'm not
          gonna see Suzie anymore. You don't
          have to worry.
          Joel keeps drinking his beer, stares straight ahead.

                         BRAD
          The last time I was over there, she
          broke it off; told me to quit
          coming over... She said she was
          gonna tell you everything -- you
          know, about us. She's really into
          you dude. I guess that's why she
          married you an' shit... You're a
          lucky guy... Sorry if I messed shit
          up.
          Beat. Joel takes another swig.

                         JOEL
          Why'd you have to get hung up on
          Suzie? You could have any girl you
          want.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, but I want Suzie. And I
          can't have her.

                         JOEL
          You had her fifteen times.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         BRAD
          Yeah, but she doesn't love me dude.
          It's just not the same... Anyway,
          just wanted to tell you that.

                         JOEL
          Well... You told me.

                         BRAD
          Alright, later...
          Brad starts to leave. Then he stops, turns around.

                         BRAD
          Oh, one more thing... I quit my
          landscaping job... And I don't
          think I'm really cut out to be a
          gigolo. So I was wondering if you
          had any openings over there at your
          extract place?

                         JOEL

                         (EXASPERATED SIGH)
          Brad, you had sex with my wife.
          I'm not gonna give you a job, okay?

                         BRAD
          Okay... Sorry man.
          Brad walks away. Joel stares at his beer for a beat,
          thinking. He calls out to Brad.

                         JOEL
          Hey Brad?...
          Brad stops.

                         BRAD
          Yeah?

                         JOEL
          I don't know... Maybe come by the
          office tomorrow. Fill out an
          application. I'll see what I can
          do.

                         BRAD
          Cool. Thanks man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

          Brian sits with Joel. They both look pretty miserable.
          Brian looks down at some papers, shaking his head.

                         BRIAN
          We're screwed. General Mills has
          pretty much withdrawn the offer
          pending a really favorable
          settlement with Step.
          (shaking his head)
          Not only do we not sell the
          company, we could wind up bankrupt.

                         JOEL
          (muttering to himself)
          So I don't sell the company, don't
          get the money, I'm bankrupt, I
          don't get Cindy, I paid a guy to
          have sex with my wife, and she
          actually did it...

                         BRIAN
          Excuse me?

                         JOEL
          Nothing.

          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY

          Suzie is trying to clean the pool herself, struggling with
          the long pole with the net at the end. She looks miserable.

          NATHAN (O.S.)
          Hello?
          Nathan enters through the back gate.

                         SUZIE

                         (MUTTERS)
          Shit...
          Nathan walks over to Suzie. She's in no mood for this. She
          acts as unfriendly as possible.

                         NATHAN
          Why are you cleaning the pool
          yourself? That new guy didn't work
          out?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, didn't work out.

                         NATHAN
          Boy, you just can't get good help,
          eh?

                         SUZIE
          Yeah.

                         NATHAN
          So, did you get a chance to write
          that check?

                         SUZIE
          Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't
          going to that dinner okay?
          Nathan acts deeply disappointed.

                         NATHAN
          Well gee, I wish you would've told
          me that before I went and bought
          the tickets.

                         SUZIE
          Joel never agreed to this Nathan,
          and neither did I.

                         NATHAN
          Well, it sure sounded like you guys
          were going. Leslie was gonna talk
          to you about it, but you didn't
          return our calls. I mean, I
          already bought these tickets.
          They're nonrefundable. I really
          wish you guys had been a little
          more clear with me...
          It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes
          all her pent-up aggression on Nathan.

                         SUZIE
          Okay, let me be really clear with
          you then. When we say "I don't
          think so," or even "I'm not sure,"
          that means "no." Why can't you
          understand that?

                         NATHAN
          Well, I just--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         SUZIE
          Shut up! In fact, let me be even
          more clear with you. We don't like
          you! Is that clear enough? You're
          dull, you never shut up, you never
          listen, and we don't want anything
          to do with you ever again!
          Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He starts to
          shake a little. Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too good
          to stop.

                         SUZIE
          Is that clear enough for you
          Nathan?! Is that...?
          Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure.

                         SUZIE

                         (WORRIED)
          Nathan?
          Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses.
          Suzie SCREAMS.

          EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- NIGHT

          Joel pulls into the parking lot. He looks surprised, seeing
          something on the other side of the lot that gets his
          attention.

                         JOEL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          No way...
          From JOEL'S POV, we see Cindy pull up and get out of her car.
          Joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up
          the stairs. Joel gets out and watches her from a distance.
          He sees her go into a room and shut the door.
          He stares up at the door for a beat. Then, with a look of
          determination, Joel walks up the stairs and knocks on her
          door.

          INT. CINDY'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

          Cindy opens the door, a little startled to see Joel, but
          pleasant to him.

                         CINDY
          Oh... Joel. I ah,...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         JOEL
          Hi.

                         CINDY
          What're you...? What's up? How'd
          you know I was here?

                         JOEL
          Ah, actually, I'm staying here too.
          Down on the first floor, around the
          back. I thought I saw you so I
          ah...

                         CINDY
          Well, come in.
          Joel enters, stands in the living room. Cindy heads in to
          the kitchen.

          CINDY (O.S.)
          Do you want something to drink? I
          think all I have is Diet Coke.
          Joel notices MARY'S PURSE lying on the coffee table. He
          stares at it.

                         JOEL
          No thanks.
          Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke.

                         CINDY
          Have a seat.
          Joel remains standing, looking at the purse.

                         JOEL
          That's Mary's purse... Isn't it?

                         CINDY
          What?

                         JOEL
          Right there. That's Mary's purse.

                         CINDY
          Oh that? No, that's mine... So
          how are things at work?

                         JOEL
          That's Mary's purse. You stole it,
          didn't you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
           Cindy acts like he's being silly. There's nothing about her
          demeanor that would make anybody think she's lying.

                         CINDY
          No. It probably just looks like
          it. There's a lot of those.

                         JOEL
          I've never seen another one. You
          probably have Sylvia's wallet in
          here somewhere too, don't you? And
          everything else that's been stolen
          from my employees.

                         CINDY
          Joel, are you okay?

                         JOEL
          No, I'm not. That's Mary's purse
          Goddammit! Okay? Everyone blamed
          Hector. He almost got fired.
          Doesn't that bother you?

                         CINDY
          (innocent, sweet)
          Joel, I don't know what you're--

                         JOEL
          Hector! Hard working guy, never
          did anything wrong. And what are
          you doing with Step? You're trying
          to screw him out of his settlement
          money aren't you?

                         CINDY
          I have no idea what you're talking
          about.

                         JOEL
          Yes you do! You're the only reason
          he's suing us aren't you? You know
          how much work it took for me to
          build up that company? You just
          don't care about anybody do you?
          What are you, some kind of
          sociopath?
          Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her.

                          JOEL (CONT'D)
          You can't even admit that you stole
          this purse can you? You just can't
          do it.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          In fact, you probably can't tell
          the truth about much of anything,
          can you?...
          Cindy turns away from him, looking down at the floor.

                         JOEL
          I bet Cindy's not even your real
          name is it? Who are you? Where
          the hell are you from?
          Cindy, still looking away, doesn't answer.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          You can't answer can you? Because
          if you said one true thing, you'd
          have to tell the truth about
          something else and then it would
          all unravel wouldn't it? Then
          you'd have to admit that you stole
          this purse and God knows what else.
          Beat. Cindy still looking away, down at the floor. We see
          her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel doesn't notice.

                         JOEL

                         (COMPOSES HIMSELF)
          Well, I'm leaving now.
          Joel picks up the purse.

                         JOEL
          And I'm taking this purse with me.
          If it really is yours, you can call
          the police and tell 'em I stole
          it... In fact, I'm gonna call the
          police and report it...
          Joel walks towards the door. Then Cindy slumps down on the
          couch, mutters something, still looking down at the floor,
          her voice cracking slightly.

                         CINDY
          Please don't...
          Joel stops.

                         JOEL
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                         CINDY
          (still looking down)
          Please don't report it to the
          police. I'm on probation. I'll go
          to jail. For a long time.

                         JOEL
          Well... Maybe you should've thought
          about that before you started
          ripping off my employees.
          Joel starts to open the door.

                         CINDY
          Joel? Please? I'll leave Step
          alone. I promise. He'll drop the
          lawsuit.
          Joel considers this.

                         JOEL
          How do I know that?

                         CINDY
          You can keep the purse. If I don't
          leave him alone; if he doesn't drop
          the lawsuit, then you can report
          me. Please?
          Beat.

                         JOEL
          Hmm... I guess that ah... Do you
          have Sylvia's wallet, and Jim's
          watch? Can I get those too?
          Beat. Cindy nods, still looking down. Joel considers it.

                         JOEL
          Well... Okay then. I guess that
          works.

                         (REALIZING)
          And I guess you just admitted that
          you stole the purse. That's good,
          I guess... A step in the right
          direction...
          Joel sits down on the couch also. With her head still down,
          Cindy is weeping quietly. Joel doesn't notice, looking
          straight ahead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         JOEL
          So what's your deal anyway?... I
          mean, how did you end up like this?
          Joel finally looks over, notices that she's crying. He's
          caught off guard.

                         JOEL
          .Ah... Cindy?
          Cindy breaks down and starts bawling.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Okay, now you see... that's what
          I'm talking about. You're trying
          to manipulate me now, and I'm not
          gonna fall for it...
          Cindy starts bawling even harder.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          I really hope you're not faking
          this right now, because I'm feeling
          really bad. Are you faking it?
          Cindy shakes her head "no."

                         JOEL
          I'm sorry, I was just curious, you
          know, how a person ends up like...
          this...
          Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically.
          Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or
          comfort her in any way.

                         JOEL
          Never mind. I'm sorry...
          Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she
          leans in to him, crying on his chest.
          He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even
          closer. As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in
          even more. Finally, she lifts her head and they start
          kissing. As they get hot and heavy we

                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

          EXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- MORNING

          Wide shot of the Hotel. It's a beautiful morning.

          INT. CINDY'S ROOM - DAY

          Joel wakes up, looking more relaxed than we've ever seen him.
          We PULL OUT to reveal that he's alone in Cindy's bed. He
          sits up, yawns. He has a big satisfied smile on his face.

                         JOEL
          Cindy?
          He looks around, realizes he's alone. Then suddenly looks
          worried.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          Oh shit!
          He scrambles for his pants, then looks relieved as he
          realizes his wallet is still there. He sets down the pants,
          then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the
          wallet and sees there's still cash and credit cards. Then he
          looks up at the chest of drawers and sees: Mary's purse,
          Sylvia's wallet, and a watch, placed side by side.
          He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes, grinning again.

          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT /MANUFACTURING AREA -- MORNING

          Extract bottles moving along the assembly line full steam.
          Mary and Gabriella gossiping.

                         MARY
          (looks at her watch)
          Joel hasn't been in all morning.
          can you believe that?

                         GABRIELLE
          If we come in late, we get fired.
          And here we're working our tails
          off, and he's gonna get rich.
          Joel walks in, bright-eyed and cheery, greeting people. He
          walks over to Mary carrying her PURSE.

                         JOEL
          Here you go Mary.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          Joel hands her the purse. Mary looks at it, not quite sure
          how to react, not ever wanting to appear grateful for
          anything -- not in her nature.

                         JOEL (CONT'D)
          And by the way, Hector didn't take
          it. Cindy did.
          Joel walks off. Mary just shakes her head at him. She
          whispers to Gabriella.

                         MARY
          Can you believe that? Blaming
          Cindy just to protect Hector.

          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY

          Joel is at his desk. Brian comes in.

                         BRIAN
          Step's here to see you.

                         JOEL
          Really? Bring him in.

                         BRIAN
          No, he's outside. At the loading
          dock. Wants to talk to you alone
          back there for some reason.

                         (CRUDE IMMITATION)
          "Man to man."

          EXT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - LOADING DOCK

          Step is pacing around, waiting. Joel comes out.

                         JOEL
          Hi Step...

                         STEP
          Hey.

                         JOEL
          How you doin'? How's your, ah...

                         STEP
          (looking down at his

                         CROTCH)
          Oh it's okay. Some days it still
          hurts, but they've got me on some
          pills. It's not too bad I guess...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         JOEL
          Well... that's good.
          They both sit down on the edge of the dock.

                         STEP
          Look, ah... Cindy left me.
          Joel's nods, not surprised, but sympathetic.

                         JOEL
          Wow... Bummer...

                         STEP
          Yeah, it is a bummer... You know, I
          thought the worst part was having
          my balls knocked off, but you know
          what the worse part is? Dealin'
          with all this bullshit... I'm sick
          of that Adler guy tellin' me what
          to do. He's a real dick.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, he sure is.

                         STEP
          The truth is, I just want to have
          my old life back -- I just want to
          go back to work. I'm a workin'
          man; that's what I do.

                         JOEL
          Yeah... I'm beginning to think I
          might be the same way... I'm a
          little worried about what I'd do
          with too much time on my hands.

                         STEP
          I just lay around and watch TV all
          day.

                         JOEL
          Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse.

                         STEP
          The problem is, if I bankrupt the
          company, there won't be a job to go
          back to.

                         JOEL
          You don't have to bankrupt the
          company.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         STEP
          Yeah, but then if I drop the
          lawsuit, you'll sell the company,
          and the new company might not hire
          me.

                         JOEL
          Well, maybe I don't have to sell
          the company... You know I've been
          thinking; all these years I've been
          building this company, dreaming
          about the day I could sell it and
          retire, but what would I really do
          if I retired? It's like that old
          saying -- it's not about the
          destination, it's about the
          journey?
          Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him.

                         JOEL
          I guess what I'm saying is, too
          much free time might not be such a
          good thing -- like that old saying,
          idle hands are the Devil's
          playground?
          Step's never heard that one either.

                         STEP
          I'm sorry, I don't do much book
          readin'.

                         JOEL
          What I'm saying is, I'm thinking
          maybe I won't sell the company...

                         STEP
          Really?

                         JOEL
          that is, if you dropped the
          lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll
          still get that insurance money --
          probably a couple hundred thousand.
          What do you think?

                         STEP
          Hmm. That sounds fair... But
          under one condition...

                         JOEL
          What's that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         STEP
          You make me floor manager.

                         JOEL
          Deal.
          They shake hands.

          INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA

          Joel walks in with Step at his side. Addresses the
          employees.

                         JOEL
          Hold the line!
          Mary shuts off the conveyer belt.

                         JOEL
          Okay, listen up everybody.
          (Waits for them to settle)
          I've decided not to sell the
          company...
          Gasps and murmurs among the employees.

                         JOEL
          And I'm making Step the new Floor
          Manager.
          More gasps and murmurs.

                         JOEL
          And if anyone doesn't like it, I
          hear they're hiring over at
          Gemco... But just remember, at
          Gemco, the owner doesn't know your
          names; you never even meet him,
          he's at an office up in Chicago
          somewhere and you get an auto-
          response if you try to email him to
          complain about anything. Here, you
          can come up to my office any time
          you have a problem. Thanks.
          Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him.

                         BRIAN
          Huh? You're not selling?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         JOEL
          It's about the journey Brian. The
          journey.
          ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up.

                         MARY
          You know, if Joel's going to put
          him in charge, we should go on
          strike. You know, at Gemco, the
          union handles the strikes and you
          don't even have to--
          PULL OUT as Step cuts her off.

                         STEP
          Quit yapping and get back to work
          or you're fired.
          Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary and
          Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads.
          LONG PULL OUT as things get back to normal at the factory.

          INT. CHAPEL - DAY

          We are CLOSE ON NATHAN, in a coffin, embalmed. We PULL OUT
          to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body.
          Joel is among them. He looks down at Nathan for a moment and
          then continues to his seat. A few rows back, we see SUZIE,
          sitting by herself, dressed in black.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          Quick shot of Nathan's casket being lowered into the ground
          as the priest says the last few words.

          EXT. CEMETERY - A LITTLE LATER

          People hug and console each other. Joel sees Suzie, walks
          over to her.

                         JOEL
          Hi... You doing okay?

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, I'm okay.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         JOEL
          I heard you were right there when
          it happened. That must've been
          rough.

                         SUZIE
          It was horrible Joel. He came over
          to ask for that check, and I
          just...
          Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING.

                         SUZIE (CONT'D)
          .I just lost it. I started
          yelling at him. I said horrible
          things. He had an aneurism and I
          probably caused it.

                         (CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY)
          I think the last thing I said to
          him was "shut up." Those were the
          last words he heard.
          Joel hugs her, consoling.

                         JOEL
          It's okay, it's not your fault...
          It's not your fault.
          Suzie's crying subsides a little.

                         SUZIE
          It could happen to any of us Joel.
          Any of us could have an aneurism.
          We could die at any moment.

                         JOEL
          Yeah, I know... I know... But we
          probably won't. It'll be alright.
          Suzie starts to regain her composure.
          They stand there for a beat.

                         JOEL
          You wanna go get something to
          eat... or something?
          Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little.

                         SUZIE
          Yeah, okay. Sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          They walk off towards the cemetery gates. After a while,
          Joel hands Suzie a Kleenex.

                         JOEL
          Here...

                         SUZIE
          Thanks.
          They walk a little further. Joel looks at the Chapel nearby.

                         JOEL
          Maybe we should've been married in
          a Church like that one. Instead of
          the Botanical Gardens.

                         SUZIE
          I thought you liked the Botanical
          Gardens?

                         JOEL
          Yeah, but... a church just seems
          more -- I don't know -- official.

                         SUZIE
          You think it would've made a
          difference?

                         JOEL
          I don't know... So, are we still
          married?

                         SUZIE
          Well, legally yes.

                         JOEL
          I mean otherwise.

                         SUZIE
          Hmmm... We can talk about it I
          suppose.

                         JOEL
          Alright.
          They walk for a beat.

                         JOEL
          You know, this is really bad,
          but... Oh never mind.

                         SUZIE
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         JOEL
          Well, as I was looking down at
          Nathan there, I was thinking...
          That's the longest I've ever seen
          him with his mouth shut.
          Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself.

                         SUZIE
          Joel!
          They walk off into the distance as we

          FADE OUT.



                        THE END
Family Man

 

		CHAPTER ONE - EARLY HISTORY

	1	INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, PAN AM TERMINAL - NIGHT

		SUPER:  AUTUMN, 1987

		A line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to 
		London.

		JACK CAMPBELL, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, Tom 
		Selleck mustache,  the hopeful look of youth in his 
		eyes... sitting next to...

		KATE REYNOLDS, 21, pretty, Dorothy Hamill haircut...
		rubbing the tears from  her swollen red eyes...

					KATE
			I got you a few necessities...

		Kate hands Jack a new copy of Vonneguts Cats 
		Cradle.

					KATE  (CONTD)
			Your copy was a mess...

		Jack accepts the book but hes unable to take his eyes 
		off Kate.  She hands him a cassette.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Every one of these songs will 
			remind you of me in a slightly 
			different way...

					JACK
			All in one tape?

					KATE
			I also put side two of London 
			Calling on there...

		Kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the 
		lips.

					KATE  (CONTD)
			That was not officially the 
			goodbye kiss. It was just an 
			interim kiss...

		He looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her 
		close, kissing her deeply. Then...

					ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
			This will be the final boarding 
			call for Pan Am flight 4 to 
			London, Heathrow.

		Jack takes Kates hand, getting up, turning sadly to 
		the gate.

					KATE
			You have your ticket?

		Jack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE.  Kate 
		nods. They embrace and kiss again.  As they separate.

					JACK
			Im not even gonna say it, 
			Kate. Maybe itll be like 
			I never left...

		Jack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the 
		gate.

		Kate stands there, watching him go.  Then...

		...a  moment of intuition. Something isnt right. She 
		looks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway, 
		trying to decide...

					KATE
			Wait.

		Jack turns. Kate approaches him.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I have a bad feeling about 
			this.

					JACK
			About the plane? What do you 
			think its gonna crash? Dont 
			say that...

					KATE
				(shaking her head)
			I know weve talked about this a 
			thousand times and we both agree 
			that going to London is the 
			right thing to do. But in my 
			heart... this feels wrong.

		She looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, 
		then back into Jacks eyes.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Dont  go, Jack...

					JACK
			You mean dont go at all?  
			What about my internship?

					KATE
			Believe me I know what an 
			incredible opportunity this 
			is for you...

					JACK
			For us, Kate.

					KATE
			Right, for us. But...Im
			afraid that if you get on 
			that plane...

					JACK
			What?

		Kate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she cant 
		say...

					KATE
				(torn)
			Go. Im sorry, you should just 
			go...

					JACK
				(thinking, then...)
			No, youre right.  What are we 
			doing?

					KATE
			We're being responsible.  Go.
			Get on the plane.

		His eyes narrow as he measures her determination...

					KATE (CONT'D)
				(a smile)
			Get the hell outta my sight.
			You bother me.

		A laugh from Jack.  Kate gives him a calm smile and a
		nod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for
		Jack.

					JACK
				(resolute)
			Okay, I'm going...

		He takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her
		tight.  Jack looks toward the gate, the line
		disappearing...Kate grasps his shirt tightly.

					KATE
			I can't seem to let go of
			you...

					JACK
			You hear me complaining about
			that?

		A sober look in Jack's eyes.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			Look, we're at the airport and
			no one ever thinks clearly at
			the airport so we should just
			trust the decision we already
			made.  You've been accepted to
			one of the best law schools in
			the country, I've got this
			internship at Barclay's Bank.
			We have a great plan, honey...

		Kate nods, then, with resolve...

					KATE
			You want to do something
			great, Jack?  Let's flush the
			plan...start our lives right
			now, today...I don't know what
			that life's gonna look like
			but I do know it has both of
			us in it.  And I choose us...

		Jack is jolted by her words.

					KATE (CONT'D)
			The plan doesn't make us
			great, Jack.  What we have
			together, that's what makes us
			great.

		Her words sink in...A long moment of decision...He
		looks toward the gate, only one person left in
		line...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes.

		Finally...He kisses her deeply on the lips...

					JACK
			I love you, Kate...

		...a smile from Kate...relief...then...

					JACK (CONT'D)
				(taking her face in
				 his hands)
			...and a year in London's not
			gonna change that.  A hundred
			years couldn't change that...

		Jack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to
		the gate, handing the attendant his ticket, not able to
		look back.

		Kate watches him go, tears streaming down her face, as
		the gate door closes behind him.  She waits, almost
		willing it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it
		doesn't...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    1A	EXT. MANHATTAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

		The skating rink at Central Park...Christmas tree at
		Rockefeller Center...the view down Fifth Avenue with
		Christmas decorations...Park Avenue.

	2	EXT. MANHATTAN - EARLY MORNING

		We close in on a spectacular pre-war doorman
		building...

	3	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		A huge space with gleaming hardwood floors, ornate
		moldings, and a great view of the Hudson and Jersey
		behind it...

		The place looks like a museum display...everything is
		of the highest quality and meticulously maintained.

		A wall of photos - Jack and Clinton, Jack with Patrick
		Ewing, Jack between Alan Greenspan and Henry Kravis.

		And a "Willie Mays" baseball bat encased in glass...

	4	INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...impeccably decorated and obsessively neat.

		Close in on the bed where JACK CAMPBELL, now 35, sans
		mustache and long hair, opens his eyes.
		A FLASH of bright morning light from the window.  Jack
		shields his eyes, turning his head toward the bathroom
		where he sees...

		A WOMAN'S BACK...draped in a towel...an incredible
		back, neither flabby nor overly toned, beautifully
		curved...Jack focuses on it a moment. As the woman
		turns to him...

		PAULA.  Beautiful, late 20s, a toothbrush in her
		mouth...

					PAULA
				(holding up toothbrush)
			   I hope you don't mind.  There
			   were like ten new ones in the
			   cabinet.

		A playful smile from Paula.

					JACK
			   It's not what you think.  I
			   took Mentadent public...

		Paula smiles, moves over to a chair and grabs a little
		black dress hanging neatly over it.

					PAULA
			   Did you really mean what you
			   said about Tuscany?

					JACK
			   Of course I did.

					PAULA
			   Last night was great...

					JACK
			   You are an amazing lover.  You
			   should be giving motivational
			   seminars.

					PAULA
			   Thanks.  You're not bad
			   yourself...

		Jack grabs his Frank Mueller watch from the night
		stand, puts it on his wrist.  He looks at Paula as she
		slips the dress on.

					JACK
			   I want to see you again.

					PAULA
			   I'd like that, too.

			JACK
			   Tonight.

		She turns to him.

					PAULA
			   It's Christmas Eve, Jack.

					JACK
			   So we'll get egg nog.

		Paula laughs.

					PAULA
				(putting on her shoes)
			   I have to go to my parents'
			   house out in Jersey.  Would
			   you like to come?

					JACK
			   Jersey?  You know what the
			   traffic's gonna be like?

					PAULA
			   I'm taking the train...

		Paula approaches Jack, leaning over him, her long hair
		dangling on his chest.

					PAULA (CONT'D)
			   Don't you have anywhere to go?

					JACK
			   I've got plenty of places to
			   go.

		He stays there, confident, sexy, waiting for an
		answer...

					PAULA
				(a sexy laugh, then...)
			   Maybe I can try and sneak away
			   some time tomorrow morning...
				(kissing him on 
				 the lips)
			   Okay?

					JACK
				(coy)
			   If it's something you feel
			   strongly about.
 
		Paula walks to the door, then turns back to Jack.

					PAULA
			It was nice meeting you, Jack...

		CHAPTER TWO - MAIN TITLES

    4A	INT. JACKS APARTMENT - MORNING

		Jack saunters over to a Yamaha Grand Disclavier in the 
		living room.  He puts a disk into the piano and...

		...the keys come alive with the music of BACH.  Jack 
		hits a switch and suddenly the entire apartment is 
		enveloped in music...

    4B	INT. JACKS BUILDING, CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

		Paula, waiting for the elevator, hears the MUSIC 
		emanating from Jacks apartment...an intrigued glance 
		back at the apartment door as the elevator arrives...

	5	INT. JACKS BATHROOM - MORNING

		Backs Passion According to St. Matthew is blaring 
		through the speakers, the music is swelling to full 
		orchestra...

		Jacks at the mirror in this incredibly neat marble-
		tiled bathroom, shaving with a silver-plated Hammacher 
		Schlemmer razor, HUMMING with the orchestra...

	6	INT. JACKS CLOSET - MORNING

		...the size of a small house, a long row of Zegna 
		suits, shoe trees stacked with Italian shoes, tailored 
		shirts everywhere.

		Jacks still HUMMING to the music as he dresses in 
		front of a mirror.

	7	INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

		Jack, wearing an elegant camels hair overcoat and 
		carrying a leather briefcase, a Master of the 
		Universe smile on his face, now HUMMING the Bach piece 
		from memory...

		The doors open at 6.  Jack self-consciously stops 
		singing as ELIZABETH PETERSON, 60s, wearing a mink 
		coat, gets on the elevator carrying a yappy little dog.

					JACK
				(a charming smile)
			   Mrs. Peterson.

					MRS. PETERSON
			   Hello Jack.  You dont 
			   have to stop singing on 
			   my account...

					JACK
			   Its because Im shy, 
			   Betty.  So, when are you 
			   going to leave that old 
			   corpse Mr. Peterson and 
			   run away with me?

					MRS. PETERSON
			   You know you could never 
			   satisfy me the way he 
			   does...

		The doors open to the lobby.  Mrs. Peterson walks out 
		ahead.

	8	INT. JACKS BUILDING, LOBBY - MORNING

		TONY THE DOORMAN holds the door open for Jack and Mrs. 
		Peterson...

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   Merry Christmas, Mr. 
			   Campbell.

					JACK
			   Howd you do this year, 
			   Tony?

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   About four grand.  And a 
			   bottle of twenty five 
			   year old scotch from Mrs. 
			   Johnson in 9D.  Im 
			   putting it all in 
			   commercial paper like you 
			   said.

					JACK
			   Just until the Deutsche 
			   Mark turns...

		Jack exits the building...

	9   OMITTED

    9A	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari racing through the park...

    10	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MORNING

		A modern Wall Street building.  The sign above the 
		glass doors reads, P.K. Lassiter and Associates, 
		Investment House.

		The Ferrari SCREECHES to a halt.  Jack gets out, heads 
		into the building...

    10A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack throws his keys to a nearby SECURITY GUARD with a 
		smile on his way to the elevators...

		CHAPTER THREE - JACK THE BUSINESSMAN

		DISSOLVE TO:

    11	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

		The Manhattan skyline shines through the windows of
		this beautiful conference room.

		SIX EXECUTIVES are seated at a huge oak table littered
		with coffee cups and lunch waste.  At the end of the
		table, ALAN MINTZ, 30s, balding, sits with a faraway
		look in his eyes, three empty Diet Coke cans in front
		of him.

		Mintz is poking at a shiny gold cherub dangling from a
		small, plastic Christmas tree, sitting in the middle of
		the table.

		Jack is addressing the group from the front of the
		room, standing in front of a computer with a huge flat
		screen monitor, covered with stock charts and tables...

					JACK
			   ...if MedTech's shares sink
			   any lower than...
				(casually executing 
				 a keystroke)
			   ...forty three, we're in
			   trouble with the stock
			   valuation.  So for god's sake
			   watch what you say to your
			   institutional customers...

		Jack notices Alan Mintz playing with the cherub.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   ...we still have almost a full
			   day of trading before zero
			   hour and I don't want any
			   trouble...
				(distracted by Mintz)
			   ...penny for your thoughts,
			   Alan...

		Alan looks up.

					ALAN
			   Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and
			   the kids I'd be home by
			   dinner.  You know, it being
			   Christmas Eve and all.

					JACK
			   Is that tonight?

		A LAUGH from the group.  Jack approaches Alan.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   You think I like being here on
			   Christmas Eve, Alan?

					ALAN
			   I don't know.  Maybe...

		Another LAUGH.  Even Jack lets out a good-natured
		chuckle.

					JACK
			   Okay, maybe I do have a touch
			   of tunnel vision this holiday
			   season.  But in two days we're
			   going to announce one of the
			   largest mergers in U.S.
			   corporate history.  Thirty
			   billion dollars...
				(basking in the glory)
			   When this kind of deal turns
			   up you get on and you ride it
			   `till it's over.  You don't
			   ask it for a vacation...

		A chuckle from the group...the esprit de corps seems to
		energize Jack.

					JACK (CONT'D)
				(to the group)
			   December 26th.  After that
			   there'll be so much money
			   floating around here it'll be
			   like Christmas every day...
				(smiling)
			   December 26th, people.  If
			   you'd like to celebrate that
			   day, you all have my
			   blessing...

		Enthusiastic nods and words of agreement from the suits
		around the table...

					ALAN
			   You're right, Jack.  Sorry...
			   Jack approaches Alan.

					JACK
			   I don't want you to be sorry,
			   Alan, I want you to be
			   excited.  I want my gift to be
			   the first one you open this
			   year.  You know why?

					ALAN
			   Why Jack?

					JACK
			   Because my gift comes with ten
			   zeroes at the end...

		A MURMUR of excitement in the room, even Alan cracks a
		smile.  Jack puts a hand on Alan's shoulder.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Good man...

    12	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

		The conference room door opens and the SIX ENERGIZED
		SUITS emerge, each met by an ASSISTANT handing them
		messages.

		Jack is the last one out.  He's met in stride by
		ADELLE, 50s, carrying a Filofax and a pile of phone
		messages.

					ADELLE
			   Only eight thirty?  What's the
			   matter, had some last minute
			   shopping to do?

		Jack pops a peppermint Lifesaver in his mouth as Adelle
		hands him his messages.

					JACK
			   You too?  This holiday's about
			   giving, Adelle.  And I'm
			   giving everything I've got to
			   this deal, so in a way, I'm
			   more Christmassy than
			   anyone...
				(holding out the candy)
			   Lifesaver?

					ADELLE
				(ignoring the candy)
			   You're a ray of sunshine,
			   Jack.

		They approach an office, the words, "Jack Campbell -
		President" stenciled on the glass...

    13	INT. JACK'S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		...continuing past Adelle's desk, Jack looking at his
		messages, and into Jack's office...

    14	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		A cavernous office, you could land a helicopter in it -
		high tech fixtures, full bar, leather sofa, $3,000
		Stairmaster...

		Jack walks to an enormous, bare mahogany desk, and sits
		down in a high tech ergonomic leather chair.

					ADELLE
			   Oh, and Oxxford called...

					JACK
			   Ooh, my suits are ready...

		He gets to the last message, sees the name on it, and
		reels back.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Kate Reynolds...

					ADELLE
			   Her assistant said you could
			   call her at home after eight.

		Jack stares at the message like he's looking at a
		ghost.

					JACK
			   Her assistant?

					ADELLE
			   Yeah Jack, her assistant...

					JACK
				(lost in the message)
			   Kate Reynolds was my
			   girlfriend in college.  I
			   almost married her...

					ADELLE
				(a hearty LAUGH)
			   You?  Married?

					JACK
				(snapping out of it)
			   Almost married.  And almost a
			   junior broker at E.F.
			   Hutton...

					ADELLE
			   Excuse me?

					JACK
			   She didn't want me to go to
			   London.  We're standing at the
			   airport saying goodbye and she
			   asks me to stay.

					ADELLE
			   So you left her?  Just like
			   that?

					JACK
			   God, no.  I thought about it
			   for practically the entire
			   flight...

					ADELLE
			   Stop Jack, I'm getting all
			   weepy.

					JACK
			   I took the road less traveled,
			   Adelle.

					ADELLE
			   And look where it's led you...
				(picking up the phone)
			   I'm gonna get her on the
			   phone...

		Jack pauses, focused on the message, his mind drifting
		back...

		Adelle begins dialing the number.  Finally, Jack
		reaches out and hangs up the phone.

					JACK
			   No...

					ADELLE
			   No?!  You almost married this
			   woman.  Aren't you even
			   curious what she wants?

					JACK
			   She's probably just having a
			   fit of nostalgia.  You know,
			   lonely Christmas Eve, call the
			   one that got away, that kind
			   of thing.

		Adelle rolls her eyes at him.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   I'm telling you, it's ancient
			   history...

		Jack looks up as PETER LASSITER, 60s, founder and
		chairman of P.K. Lassiter and Associates, saunters into
		the room.

					LASSITER
			   Eight forty-five on Christmas
			   Eve and Jack Campbell is still
			   at his desk.  There's a
			   Hallmark moment for you...

		Lassiter heads to the bar like he's done it a million
		times.

					JACK
			   Peter.  I don't see you
			   rushing home to trim the tree.

					LASSITER
				(pouring himself 
				 a scotch)
			   That's because I'm a heartless
			   bastard who only cares about
			   money.

					JACK
			   And God love you for it.

		Lassiter drops down in a soft leather chair opposite
		Jack.

					LASSITER
				(sipping the scotch)
			   I just got a call from Terry
			   Haight.  Bob Thomas is
			   nervous...

					JACK
			   That'll happen when you're
			   about to spend thirty billion
			   dollars on some aspirin...

					LASSITER
			   Someone's gonna have to nurse
			   him through this.

					JACK
			   Why are you staring at my
			   breasts, Peter?

					LASSITER
			   I need you, tiger..

					JACK
			   Where is he?

					LASSITER
			   Aspen.

		Jack pauses for a beat.

					JACK
				(to Adelle)
			   Call Aunt Irma.  Tell her I
			   won't be able to make it
			   tomorrow...

		Adelle rolls her eyes at him...

					LASSITER
			   You're a credit to capitalism,
			   Jack.

		Jack glances at Adelle, then looks back at Lassiter.

					JACK
			   Hey Peter, lemme ask you a
			   question.  An old girlfriend
			   calls you out of the blue on
			   Christmas Eve...

					LASSITER
			   You suddenly having trouble
			   getting dates?

					JACK
			   Not by a long shot.

					LASSITER
			   Then leave it in the past.
			   Old flames are like old tax
			   returns.  You keep `em in the
			   file cabinet for three years
			   and then you cut `em loose.

		Jack shoots Adelle a satisfied smile, crumpling up
		Kate's message and tossing a perfect hook into a N.Y.
		Knicks hoop.

					JACK
				(to Adelle)
			   I'll leave from the office
			   tomorrow afternoon.  Call the
			   group.  Schedule an emergency
			   strategy session for noon.

					ADELLE
			   That'll be a nice little
			   holiday treat.

    15	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

		A single light remains on in the building.

    16	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

		Jack is alone in the office working on his computer,
		checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor.

		Jack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes.  He
		checks his watch.  It's past eleven.  He gets up, goes
		to the window, sees the city in all its Christmas
		glory, then he see it...

		...the message from Kate, crumpled in the
		trashcan...then turns back to the window, gazing out at
		the night...

    17	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

		Jack comes out of the elevator, walking past the lobby
		desk where FRANK, a security guard, sits watching the
		monitors.

					FRANK
			   Mr. Campbell.  Why didn't you
			   call down, I would've had Joe
			   get your ride.

		Jack looks outside the front door to the snowy, quiet
		street.

					JACK
			   I'm thinking I might walk
			   tonight, Frank.

					FRANK
			   Nice night for it.  I'll have
			   Louis send your car home.

		A nod from Jack.

					FRANK (CONT'D)
			   Merry Christmas to you, sir...

					JACK
			   Thanks.  To you too...

		Jack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads
		out into the crisp night air...

    18	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINOUS

		Jack emerges from the building, walking across the
		large plaza, past the fountain...snow begins to fall...

    19	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack's walking down the nearly empty street, snow
		falling down on him, a bounce in his step, looking at
		the windows of the closed shops along the way.

		He gets to the end of the block spots the Wong
		Brothers' 24 Hour Deli across the street...

		He heads toward it...

    20	INT. WONG BROTHERS' DELI - SECONDS LATER
 
		Jack walks into the brightly lit deli...

		SAM WONG, 20s, is with his 80-year-old GRANDFATHER
		behind the counter.  There's a NERDY COLLEGE KID at the
		salad bar, a drunken DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA at the
		liquor display, a WOMAN with a BABY in an aisle and...

		...a BLACK MAN, 30s, with a dollar sign and the name
		"CASH" tattooed on his arm, stands in front of the
		coffee machine...

					CASH
			   Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!  She's
			   a certified winner...paper-
			   thin but good as gold...

		Jack notices Cash talking to himself, seemingly crazy.

		Jack approaches Sam Wong at the counter.

					JACK
			   Egg nog?

					SAM WONG
				(pointing)
			   Dairy case.  Five dollar.

					CASH
				(in the b.g., to 
				 Sam Wong)
			   Y'all do the lotto here...?
			   `Cause I got me a winner...I
			   know, I know, Lotto keeps the
			   black man down... but not
			   me...

		Jack grabs a carton of egg nog, then notices Cash
		handing Sam Wong his ticket.  Jack heads back toward
		the counter...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   ...06...14...18...48...right
			   there.  Four numbers...that's
			   two hundred and thirty eight
			   dollar...
				(a smile)
			   Merry Christmas and shit...

					SAM WONG
				(barely looking 
				 at ticket)
			   Ticket bad.  You draw in lines
			   with pencil.

					CASH
			   What're you talkin' about?

					SAM WONG
				(throwing the ticket 
				 back)
			   You draw lines with pencil!  I
			   know about this!

		The woman with the baby looks over...the college kid
		looks up, nervous...the drunken Santa, bottle of
		bourbon in hand, starts to walk by Jack...Jack
		instinctively puts an arm out, holding the Santa
		back...

					CASH
			   What!?  Look at the ticket...!

					SAM WONG
			   Get out, I call 911.

		The Santa looks at Jack, confused.

					CASH
			   You're lookin' at me, you're
			   not even lookin' at the
			   ticket!

		The woman with the baby puts a loaf of bread back on
		the shelf, starts nervously inching toward the door.

					SAM WONG
			   You leave now.  Take ticket
			   somewhere else.
				(calling out)
			   Next customer in line...!

					CASH
			   You first generation,
			   xenophobic, money-theistic,
			   hot pastrami sandwich
			   making...

					SAM WONG
				(screaming)
			   Get out!

		Just watching...Cash shoves the ticket in Sam Wong's
		face...

					CASH
			   LOOK AT THE GODDAMN TICKET!!

		A moment of decision for Jack.  Then...

					JACK
				(carefully)
			   Let me see that ticket.

		Cash turns to Jack.

					CASH
				(menacing)
			   Was I talkin' to you?!

		Jack looks at the woman, the college kid, the Santa,
		then...

					JACK
			   Maybe I'll buy it from you.

		Now Cash walks over to Jack...

					CASH
			   Guy in $2,000 suit gets ass
			   kicked tryin' to be a hero.
			   Film at eleven...
				(then...turning to 
				 the coffee machine)
			   What?!  Oh no, not another
			   lookie-loo.  You know how big
			   a job this is?

		The patrons exchange nervous glances...Jack watches,
		confused.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   You're double bookin' me!
			   You're gonna get double
			   billed!  Shit!

		Cash throws a bottle of Perrier against the wall, it
		SHATTERS.  The woman reels back in terror with the
		baby...

					JACK
			   Hey, c'mon...

		In a flash, Cash whips a .38 from the back of his
		pants, aiming it at Jack's face.  The woman SCREAMS,
		covers her baby.

					CASH
				(in Jack's face)
			   Do you want to die?

		Jack stares at Cash, trying his best to keep his
		cool...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   DO YOU WANNA DIE?!

					JACK
			   No.
 
					CASH
				(a smile)
			   Yes you do...

					JACK
			   Look, I'm talking about a
			   business deal here.  I buy the
			   ticket for two hundred, take
			   it to a store where the guy
			   behind the counter...
				(glaring at Sam Wong)
			   ...doesn't have a death wish
				(back to Cash)
			   ...I just made myself a quick
			   thirty eight dollars.

		Cash gets closer...

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Like I said, it's a business
			   deal...

					CASH
			   Damn, you are the real
			   thing...

		Cash narrows his eyes...then, a smile as he puts the
		gun back into his pants...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   C'mon, Jack, let's get outta
			   here...
				(to Sam Wong)
			   You were lookin' at me, papa,
			   you shoulda been lookin' at
			   the ticket.  That ticket was
			   legit, B.  You're fake...

		Cash starts out of the deli.  Jack follows...

    21	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Cash walking down the street...Jack, holding
		his carton of egg nog under his arm, counting out two
		hundred dollars...

					JACK
			   How'd you know my name was
			   Jack?

					CASH
			   I call all you white guys
			   "Jack."

		Jack nods...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   You know you seem pretty
			   relaxed for a guy who just had
			   a gun pulled on him.

					JACK
			   There's no way I was gonna die
			   in that deli...
				(off Cash's look)
			   Let's just say I've been on a
			   lucky streak lately.

					CASH
				(a big LAUGH)
			   A lucky streak, huh?

		Jack hands him the money.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   Sound pretty sure of yourself,
			   don't you?

		Jack nods.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   So you're telling me, you've
			   got a gun to your head and you
			   don't think for one second,
			   what if this, what if that,
			   maybe I shouldn't do this, I
			   shoulda done that.

					JACK
			   I don't do that.  That's just
			   not for me...

		Cash looks at him, then smiles.

					CASH
			   Okay, Jack.  Nice doing
			   business with you...
			   Cash is about to take off...

					JACK
			   Hey...

		Cash turns around.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   What do you want to carry that
			   gun around for, anyway?
			   You're just gonna do something
			   you'll regret...

					CASH
			   You want to talk about
			   regrets, you're talking to the
			   wrong person.

		Jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag, opens
		the carton...

					JACK
			   I'm just saying that you seem
			   like a smart guy.  At a
			   certain point you're gonna do
			   something, and then there's no
			   turning back...

					CASH
			   Yeah, in most cases that'd be
			   true.

		Jack takes a sip of the egg nog.

					JACK
			   I mean there must be programs
			   out there, opportunities...

					CASH
				(a deep laugh)
			   Wait a minute, wait a
			   minute... you're tryin' to
			   save me?

		A look from Jack...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   Oh man, you're serious...
				(out to the street)
			   This man thinks I need to be
			   saved!

					JACK
			   Everyone needs something.

		Cash looks at Jack...

					CASH
			   Yeah?  What do you need?

					JACK
			   Me?

					CASH
			   You just said everyone needs
			   something.

					JACK
			   I've got everything I need.

					CASH
			   Wow.  It must be great being
			   you.  You got it all.

		Cash looks at Jack.  He smiles and shakes his head.

					JACK
			   Look, I'm not saying you'd be
			   able to do it without some
			   hard work...

					CASH
				(a hearty LAUGH)
			   You still think this is about
			   me, don't you?

					JACK
			   Sure it's about you.  But it's
			   about society, too.

					CASH
			   Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this
			   one... Just remember, Jack,
			   you did this.  You brought
			   this on yourself...

		And with that, Cash turns and leaves Jack alone on the
		street with his egg nog...

    22	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks in and throws his keys on a table.  He takes
		off his gloves and overcoat, glances at the mail, then
		heads into the bedroom.

		Through the large windows we see snow falling...

    23	INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep...

		CHAPTER FOUR - A DIFFERENT LIFE

		DISSOLVE TO:

    24	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

		Close in on Jacks face, bathed in morning light...he 
		opens his eyes...feels something strange...

		Jack looks down...theres a womans head resting on his 
		chest.

		A look of confusion crosses his face...trying to 
		remember... did he meet a woman last night...?

		He turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting 
		faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail...

		...did she have a dog?

		He looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to 
		get a look at her face.  And then he sees her...

		...KATE REYNOLDS...

		...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter 
		contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...

		His head darts around the room - its cramped and lived 
		in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on 
		the dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed 
		and a charming little bay window.

		He instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch 
		on the night stand, but its not there.  Its a Timex 
		Indiglo and it reads, 7:57 A.M...

		Jack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe its 
		a dream...but nothing changes.  Then, Kate stirs...

					KATE
			   Mmmm...ten more minutes, 
			   Jack... its Christmas...

		Jack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time...

		Suddenly, the door bursts open...A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL, 
		ANNIE, in a little nightgown, walks into the room 
		carrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY, JOSH, SINGING at the top 
		of her lungs...

					ANNIE
			   Jingle bells, Santa s
			   mells, Rudolph laid an 
			   egg...la la la, la-la la 
			   la, la la la la la...

		Annie places Josh on the bed and then jumps up 
		herself.  She gestures to the dog, patting the bed.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   You too, Luce...

		The dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed, joining 
		everybody else and leaving very little room.  Annie 
		starts jumping.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   Rise...and...shine...!

					KATE
				(stirring)
			   Youre jumping, 
			   sweetheart...

		Jack looks at this activity like a man at his own 
		funeral.

					ANNIE
			   Mom, dont you think we 
			   need to open the 
			   presents?

					KATE
				(groggy)
			   Mommy needs five more 
			   minutes in la la land.  
			   That could be her 
			   present...

		Josh crawls directly up to Jacks stomach, climbing 
		on.

					ANNIE
			   Cmon, Dad.  Get up!

		She said Dad.

		Thats it.  Jack moves the baby gingerly over, then 
		gets out of bed, stumbling over a baseball bat lying 
		next to it.

		He picks up the bat...the same Willie Mays autograph 
		bat that was encased in glass in his N.Y. apartment.

		Frightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself 
		for the first time...hes naked...

		...a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on 
		the bed...

		...he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow 
		cardigan off the chair and throws them on...

		Kate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand.

					KATE
			   Jack...?

		Jack turns by instinct.  Kate grabs him, drawing him 
		near.  A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her 
		eyes...

		Eye contact...Jacks certain hes about to hear her 
		scream...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(still groggy)
			   Strong coffee, okay?

		She lets him go as Jack backs out the door...

    25	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

		A garishly decorated Christmas tree sits in the middle 
		of this messy and disorganized living room, a bevy of 
		gifts underneath and four red stockings over the 
		fireplace.

		Jack darts to the top of the steps...

					KATE (O.S.)
				(calling from 
				 the bedroom)
			   Use an entire can if you 
			   have to!

		He looks back at the bedroom, then at the 
		stairs...quickly heading down the CREAKY steps, still 
		in shock.

		He grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front 
		door...about to step out when he looks down and 
		realizes...

		...hes barefoot.  He glances at a pair of rubber over-
		boots sitting by the door, slips them on, just about to 
		leave when...

		He hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the door 
		lock...Jack looks at the door, not quite sure what to 
		do...

		The door opens...into the house, arms laden with 
		wrapped gifts, walk BIG ED and LORRAINE REYNOLDS (both 
		60s), Kates parents.  Big Eds wearing a ten gallon 
		hat and a suede overcoat.  Lorraine has a cigarette 
		dangling from her mouth.

					JACK
				(drawing on a 
				 memory)
			   Ed?  Lorraine?

		Big Ed hugs Jack as best he can with an armful of 
		gifts.

					BIG ED
			   Jack you ol bird dog.  
			   Merry Christmas to ya...

		Lorraine plants a big fat kiss on Jacks cheek.

					LORRAINE
			   Talk to him, Jack.  
			   Please.  One day a year 
			   away from the Ponderosa.  
			   I dont think thats too 
			   much to ask.

					BIG ED
			   I heard that.  This is 
			   who I am, woman!
				(a wink to Jack)
			   Tell her, Jack!  Youre 
			   the only one who gets me, 
			   for gods sake!

		Jack, still holding the door open, plotting his escape.

					LORRAINE
			   I need some egg nog...

					BIG ED
			   Course you do.  Hell, 
			   its almost 8 a.m.  
				(shouting upstairs)
			   Where are my two lil 
			   pardners?  Annie!  Josh!  
			   Giddy up, Bid Eds here!

					JACK
			   Excuse me.

		Jack dashes out the door.

					LORRAINE
			   Where are you going, 
			   Jack?
				(to Big Ed)
			   Wheres he going?

					BIG ED
			   Damned if I know...

		They start to remove their coats, when...

		The door flies back open...

					JACK
			   Wheres my car?!  Wheres 
			   my Ferrari!?

					BIG ED
			   What the hell are you 
			   talking about?
				(to Lorraine)
			   Whats he talking about?

					JACK
			   Look, can I just borrow 
			   your car?!  I promise 
			   itll be returned!

					BIG ED
			   The Caddy?  Why dont you 
			   take your own damn car!

					LORRAINE
			   Oh just let him borrow 
			   your precious Cadillac, 
			   for gods sake.

		Jack spots a set of keys hanging on a hook.

					BIG ED
			   Hes got a perfectly good 
			   mini-van sitting out 
			   there in the driveway!

		Jack grabs the keys off the hook...darts back outside...

    26	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

		Jack emerges from this charming, suburban two-story 
		house, some tasteful Christmas lights decorating a tree 
		in the center of the snow-covered lawn...

		He races to a blue Dodge mini-van sitting in the 
		driveway, a My Ferrari Is In The Shop sticker on the 
		rear bumper.  He climbs into the mini-van and peels out 
		of the driveway...

    27	INT. MINI-VAN - SECONDS LATER

		Jack sees a sign, George Washington Bridge - 3 miles...

    28	INT. MINI-VAN - MINUTES LATER

		Jack driving over the bridge.  A sigh of relief as he 
		passes under a sign for Manhattan.

    29	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - EARLY MORNING

		The mini-van pulls up near Jacks apartment building.  
		Jack, still wearing pajamas under the coat, leaps out, 
		running toward the grand entrance where Tony stands 
		sternly in front.

					JACK
			   Tony, thank god...

		Jack starts to walk past but Tony blocks the way.

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   Sorry, pal.  Entrance is 
			   for residents and guests 
			   only...

					JACK
			   What are you talking 
			   about?  Its me, Jack 
			   Campbell.  Penthouse C.  
			   I put you into commercial 
			   paper!

					TONY THE DOORMAN
				(not moving)
			   Uh-huh...

		Just then, Mrs. Peterson walks to the door with 
		her little DOG.  Tony opens the door for her...

					JACK
			   Elizabeth Peterson!

		The little dog starts BARKING ferociously at Jack.

					MRS. PETERSON
				(to Tony re: 
				 Jack, annoyed)
			   Who is this man?

		Tony shrugs his shoulders.

					JACK
			   You know me, Betty.  You 
			   do.  Jack Campbell.  
			   Were on the co-op board 
			   together.  We fought side 
			   by side for garbage 
			   disposals.  Every morning 
			   we exchange quasi-sexual 
			   witty banter.  Think...

		She looks at Jack with a raised eyebrow, the dog still 
		YAPPING.

					TONY THE DOORMAN
				(to Mrs. Peterson)
			   Should I call the cops?  
			   Im gonna call the 
			   cops...

		Jack pleads to her with his eyes.

					MRS. PETERSON
				(raising a hand 
				 to Tony)
			   No...

					JACK
				(a sigh of relief)
			   Thank you, Betty.  I know 
			   if I can just sleep this 
			   off, Ill be fine...

					MRS. PETERSON			
			   And sleep you shall.  
			   Noblesse oblige is not 
			   dead.  Not yet 
			   anyway...Come, lets get 
			   you some help.  Surely 
			   there must be a shelter 
			   somewhere in this city.

					JACK
			   A shelter?!  Im the 
			   richest guy in the 
			   building...Ive got twice 
			   the square footage you 
			   have!

		Mrs. Peterson shakes her head at him, a look of pity on 
		her face.

		Frustrated, Jack turns and runs back to the mini-van...

		CUT TO:

    30	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

		Jack pulls up across the street and gets out of the 
		van.  Running across the empty plaza toward the 
		building entrance...

    31	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

		Jack bursts through the door, approaching the lobby 
		desk where FRANK the security guard sits.

		Frank spots Jack and blocks his way.

					FRANK
			   Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold 
			   it right there...

					JACK
			   Frank.  Wheres Alan 
			   Mintz?  Is he here yet?

					FRANK
			   Mr. Mintz?
				(a knowing chuckle)
			   I dont think 
			   so...buildings closed 
			   pal.  Youll have to come 
			   back tomorrow.

					JACK
			   Look, I dont know whats 
			   going on here but I am 
			   Senior Vice President of 
			   this company.

					FRANK
			   I dont care who you 
			   are.  Its Christmas and 
			   like I told you the 
			   building is closed.

					JACK
			   Maybe youre not hearing 
			   me.  I am Jack 
			   Campbell...
				(approaching the 
				 building directory)
			   Right here.  Jack 
			   Campbell, President...

		And then he sees it...ALAN MINTZ - PRESIDENT, listed 
		plain as day on the building director...

		Jack looks at Frank, then back to the building 
		directory...

		A pitying look from Frank...Jack stands there, in 
		shock...

		CHAPTER FIVE - WHATS HAPPENING?

    32	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING, PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

		...its desolate...

		Jack walks through the plaza like a zombie, his face 
		registering nothing.  He crosses the street, moving
		toward the mini-van...oblivious...when...

		SCREECH...a Ferrari 456M stops within inches of Jacks 
		torso...a VOICE from the car...

					VOICE (O.S.)
			   Hey!  Watch where youre 
			   walking!

		Jack turns...sees the DRIVER low in the seat...cant 
		quite make out the face...

					VOICE 
			   You almost dented my two 
			   hundred thousand dollar 
			   car!

		Jack...still stunned...looks at the car, very 
		familiar...the voice of the driver, also familiar...

					VOICE (CONTD)
			   Thats right!  My new 
			   cars worth more than 
			   your shitty house!

		A look of realization on Jacks face...

					VOICE (CONTD)
			   I feel like I really did 
			   win the lottery!

		...its Cash, and hes in Jacks car...

		Jack moves over to the passenger window in shock...a 
		smile from Cash...

					CASH
			   Miss me, Jack?

					JACK
			   Thats my car!  You stole 
			   my car!

					CASH
			   Its a callable asset 
			   seized in accordance with 
			   the acquisition by-laws 
			   of your alt-fate 
			   contract...

					JACK
			   What?!

					CASH
			   Basically, its my car 
			   now.  Get in.

		Cash reaches over and opens the door.  Jack 
		hesitates...

					CASH (CONTD)
			   Look, I dont make the 
			   rules, Jack.  This is how 
			   it works.  Get in.

		Cash gives him a reassuring look.  Jack gets in...

    33	INT. FERRARI - CONTINUOUS

		Jack closes the door...Cash joyfully drives off in a 
		burst of acceleration...Jack practically ends up in the 
		back seat...

					CASH
			   Might wanna fasten your 
			   seat belt, Jack...

					JACK
				(recovering)
			   What the hell is 
			   happening to me?!

		Jacks freaking out and Cash is enjoying every minute 
		of it.  Cash hands Jack a paper bag.  Jack starts 
		breathing into the bag.

					CASH
			   This kinda thing makes a 
			   lotta guys throw up.  
			   Seen it happen.  So if 
			   you get the urge, do it 
			   out the window.
				(with a taunting 
				 laugh)
			   I dont want you marring 
			   this exquisite leather 
			   interior...

		Cash looks over at Jack...hes really losing it, 
		sobbing into the bag...almost hyperventilating...Cash 
		smiles...

					CASH (CONTD)
			   Look, I dont know what 
			   youre getting so worked 
			   up about, you did 
			   this...you brought this 
			   on yourself.

					JACK
			   Brought what on myself?!  
			   I didnt do anything!

					CASH
			   No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive 
			   got everything I need, I 
			   dont have regrets, 
			   thats just not for me... 
			   sound familiar?

					JACK
			   You mean because you 
			   thought I was cocky Im 
			   now on a permanent acid 
			   trip?!!

		Cash gets a laugh out of Jacks overreaction...

					CASH
			   Everyone else in that 
			   store is a statue, they 
			   see their lives passing 
			   in front of their eyes, 
			   but not you.  Youre 
			   making a business deal...

					JACK
				(enraged)
			   Give me my goddamn life 
			   back!

					CASH
			   You?  What about me?  Im 
			   working hard for you 
			   here, Jack.  On Christmas 
			   too!  Now you did a good 
			   thing last night, 
			   intervening that way.  I 
			   was moved...

					JACK
				(interrupting)
			   Please.  Just tell me 
			   whats happening to me.  
			   In plain English.  None 
			   of that mumbo jumbo...

		Cash turns to Jack.

					CASH
			   Its a glimpse, Jacko.

					JACK
			   I glimpse?  A glimpse of 
			   what!?  What glimpse?!  
			   Glimpse!

					CASH
			   Look, eventually, 
			   everybody gets one...some 
			   of em take a couple 
			   seconds...
				(looking at Jack)
			   ...some of em take a lot 
			   longer...

					JACK
			   I asked you a direct 
			   question!  A glimpse of 
			   what?!

		A look from Cash.

					CASH
			   Figure it out.  You got 
			   plenty of time.

					JACK
			   How much time?!

					CASH
			   As long as it takes to 
			   figure it out.  Which, in 
			   your case, could be 
			   considerable.

					JACK
			   Look, I just want my life 
			   back.  Now whats it 
			   gonna take?  You wanna 
			   talk turkey?  Lets talk 
			   turkey!  How much 
			   money...?

		Cash looks at Jack, relishing the moment.  He flashes 
		Jack a smile.

					CASH
			   Do I look like I need 
			   your money.  It doesnt 
			   work like that and I 
			   cant tell you why.

					JACK
			   Why not?

					CASH
			   Because you got to figure 
			   it out for yourself.
				(beat)
			   Are you listening to me?

					JACK
			   Figure it out?  Figure 
			   what out?!

		Cash just stares at him...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats it?  Thats all I 
			   get?!  A glare?!

					CASH
			   Look Jack, in my 
			   experience the best way 
			   people deal with this is 
			   to just relax and breathe 
			   through it...let it come 
			   to you.

		Jack faces Cash, simmering...with frustration.

					JACK
			   Look, I dont have time 
			   for this right now.  Im 
			   in the middle of a 
			   deal...
					CASH
			   Oh youre working on a 
			   new deal now...did I
			   mention that?

					JACK
			   You know what?  Ive had 
			   it with you.  Ive had it 
			   with all of this shit...

		SCREECH...Cash slams on the brakes...practically 
		sending Jack through the windshield.

		Jack recovers, looks up...the car is parked right next 
		to the mini-van.

		Cash pulls out a small plastic bag, holding it out to 
		Jack...

					CASH
			   Here...

		Jack looks inside the bag, pulls out a BARBIE BICYCLE 
		BELL.  He looks at it curiously.

					JACK
			   Whats this, a signal?  
			   Will you come whenever I 
			   ring it?

					CASH
			   Do I look like I live in 
			   a bottle?

		Cash reaches across Jack and opens the door.

					JACK
				(lost)
			   But what do I do?

					CASH
			   Look Jack Im late.  Id 
			   love to help you out some 
			   more but I gotta go 
			   handle my business...
				(gesturing to 
				 the mini-van)
			   Happy trails.

		Jack looks out to the lonely street outside, then back 
		to Cash.

					JACK
			   Hey, you did this to me, 
			   you cant just leave me 
			   like this.

		Cash looks at Jack, the desperation on his face.

					CASH
			   Fine.  You want to know 
			   everything, Ill tell you 
			   everything.  But not 
			   here.  Lets get some 
			   air...

		Jacks still a little unsure...he sees Cash open the 
		driver side door...

					JACK
				(relieved)
			   Thanks, man...

		Jack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn 
		around, Cashs door SLAMS shut and the car takes off in 
		a blast of horsepower...

		Jack stands there gazing down the street, listening to 
		the sound of the Ferrari shifting gears, 
		disappearing...

		The wind whips up...shivering, Jack looks toward the 
		Lassiter Building, then to the plastic bag in his hand, 
		and finally to the mini-van.

    34	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE MORNING

		The blue mini-van snakes through the curved streets of 
		the neighborhood, almost all the houses decorated for 
		Christmas.

    35	INT. MINI-VAN - SAME TIME

		Jacks trying to find the house, a map unfolded on the 
		steering wheel and the cars registration in his 
		hand...

		He spots ARNIE BENDER, late 30s, carrying an empty 
		science kit box to the trash.  His wife, JEANNIE, also 
		late 30s, is getting in a Ford Taurus wagon, a bowl of 
		fruit in hand...

		Jack pulls up to the curb near Arnie, rolling down the 
		window.

					JACK
			   Excuse me.  Do you know 
			   where Merrison Street is?

		Arnie looks up and sees Jack in the van.

					ARNIE
				(turning to his wife)
			   Jeannie!  I found Jack!

    36	INT. BENDER HOUSE, DEN - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack follows Arnie into the den of this garishly 
		decorated suburban home, Arnies arm around his 
		shoulder.

					ARNIE
			   You look terrible...

		Jack takes in the decor  its a male leisure time 
		fantasy  old pinball machine, wide screen TV, dart 
		board, and kitschy 50s style bamboo bar...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Truth is I expected you.  
			   Kate called before and 
			   asked if I knew where you 
			   were.

		Arnie notices Jacks fascination with the room...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   I know, I moved the 
			   Barca-lounger into the 
			   corner.  Its throwin 
			   everybody off.  What do 
			   you think?

					JACK
				(with a nod)
			   Great room...

		A satisfied smile from Arnie, Jacks approval means 
		something to him.

					ARNIE
			   You and me, buddy.  We 
			   know how to live...

		Arnie shepherds Jack onto a bar stool and pours a drink 
		out of a bamboo bottle holder.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   So Jack, you okay?

		Jack doesnt respond, his eyes drawn to a softball team 
		photo on the bar...Jack and Arnie kissing a huge trophy 
		with the caption, Plainfield, N.J. Softball League 
		Champs, 1994.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   I mean you leave the 
			   house on Christmas 
			   morning, you dont tell 
			   anyone where youre 
			   going...

		Jack looks over from the photo to Arnie...

					JACK
			   Were friends, arent we?

					ARNIE
			   Maybe I dont say it 
			   enough but you moving in 
			   next door to me...

		Arnie makes a fist and gestures to his heart.  Jack 
		nods.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Talk to me...

		A moment of decision for Jack as Arnie stands there, 
		open eyed, ready to listen.

					JACK
			   Im having kind of a bad 
			   day.

					ARNIE
				(nodding)
			   I read somewhere that the 
			   suicide rate doubles 
			   during the holidays...

		A raised eyebrow from Jack.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(to himself)
			   What am I saying?  You 
			   dont need to hear 
			   that...
				(back to Jack)
			   All I meant was a lot of 
			   people have a hard time 
			   dealing with all the 
			   forced reverie, thats 
			   all.  Is that you?

					JACK
			   Is it...?

					ARNIE
			   Trouble at work?

					JACK
			   I dont think so.

					ARNIE
			   Its not Kate, is it?

		Jack pauses at the mention of Kate.  Arnies eyes 
		widen...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(proudly)
			   You see, its like were 
			   in each others heads...

					JACK
			   Kates my wife...

		Jack looks at Arnie as if hes seeking confirmation.

					ARNIE
				(a playful smile) 
			   Just keep saying it, 
			   Jack, like a mantra.

		Arnie comes out from behind the bar, taking Jack by the 
		arm.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Cmon, I better walk ya 
			   home.  Shes mad enough 
			   as it is, right...?

    37	EXT. ARNIES YARD - SECONDS LATER

		Arnie walks Jack through his backyard...

					ARNIE
			   Look, you fit the profile 
			   exactly.  Thirties, 
			   house, kids, financial 
			   responsibilities.  You 
			   start thinking...this 
			   isnt the life I dreamt 
			   about.  Wheres the 
			   romance, wheres the joie 
			   de vivre?  Suddenly, 
			   every lingerie ad in the 
			   Newark Star Ledger 
			   represents a life you 
			   cant have...

					JACK
				(thinking, then...)
			   Its just two kids, 
			   right?

		A chuckle from Arnie.

					ARNIE
			   You made a choice, Jack, 
			   a promise to your wife. 
			   Maybe sometimes it seems 
			   like you gave up the 
			   world, but look what you 
			   got...

		They arrive at...the backyard of the Campbell house... 
		cluttered with a swing set, a dog run with chewed up 
		lawn, and a wooden sun deck in the process of being 
		built...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Four bedrooms, two and a 
			   half baths, and a 
			   partially finished 
			   basement...

		Jack trips over a wayward BIG WHEEL.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(shaking his head)
			   Kids...

		Arnie leads Jack toward the house.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Okay look, you probably 
			   dont want to hear this 
			   right now but remember
			   what you told me last 
			   summer when I almost had 
			   that thing with Arnie 
			   Jr.s speech therapist.

		A blank stare from Jack as they arrive at the sliding 
		glass door...Arnie faces Jack squarely, grabbing his 
		shoulders and looking him in the eye.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Dont screw up the best 
			   thing in your life just 
			   because youre a little 
			   unsure about who you 
			   are.  Okay?

		Arnie gives Jack a comforting smie...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   God, it feels so good to 
			   finally give something 
			   back to you...

		Arnie turns Jack toward the door and slides it open.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Im gonna hug you now...

		Arnie gives Jack a gentle hug...then gives him a little 
		push toward the door...

    38	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - CONTINUOUS

		Jack steps inside.  He turns back to the door but 
		Arnies gone.

		Then, Kate enters the room, holding a portable phone...

					KATE
				(into phone)
			   Hold on a second...

		She cups the receiver.  Jack looks at her, shes 
		dressed now, nothing fancy but she looks great.

					JACK
			   You cut your hair...

		A curious look from Kate.

					KATE
			   Ten years ago...

		Kate just stands there looking at Jack, giving away 
		nothing.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Are you okay?

					JACK
			   Yeah...fine.

		She gives him a resolute nod, then...

					KATE
				(into phone)
			   Never mind, he just 
			   walked in...

		Jack grimaces as she resolutely hangs up the phone then 
		stares him down angrily.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Do you have any idea what 
			   you put us through 
			   today?!  You walk out of 
			   here at 7:30 in the 
			   morning, dont tell me 
			   where youre going, or 
			   even that youre going, 
			   and I dont see you til 
			   hours later.  I had state 
			   troopers looking for 
			   you!  I called 
			   hospitals...
				(pointing at 
				 the phone)
			   ...I was just on the 
			   phone with the morgue 
			   for gods sake!

		Jack watches her vent, the frustration on his face 
		building.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   What kind of man leaves 
			   his family on Christmas 
			   morning without a word 
			   about where hes going?

		Jacks almost to a breaking po	INT.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   What kind of man does 
			   that!?

					JACK
				(jumping in)
			   I dont know!  Please 
			   stop yelling at me!

		She looks at him curiously.

					KATE
			   Where were you?

					JACK
			   I was in the city.

					KATE
			   The city?  New York 
			   City?  Why?

					JACK
			   Because thats where I 
			   live.

					KATE
			   Jack...dont even 
			   start...

					JACK
			   Look, you dont 
			   understand.  I woke up 
			   here...and this is very 
			   strange ...this is not my 
			   house...

		A raised eyebrow from Kate.  Jack moves around the 
		room...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(pointing upstairs)
			   Im not Dad....  Kate, 
			   youre not my wife...

		Kate looks him over, assessing, then...

					KATE
			   You know what, Jack?  
			   Its not funny this 
			   time.  Im really angry.

		She stares him down, expecting an answer.  But he has 
		no answer.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(loudly)
			   Jack!

		Jack takes the bell out of the plastic bag that Cash 
		gave him, holds it up in front of her and starts 
		RINGING it furiously.

		Then...Annie rides into the room on her new bike.

					ANNIE
				(re: bell)
			   Whats that?

		Jack watches as she pedals over, reaches into his hand 
		and takes the bicycle bell...

					ANNIE (CONTD)
				(examining the bell)
			   I like this...
				(jumping up and 
				 giving hima peck 
				 on the cheek)
			   ...thanks, Dad!

		Annie rides excitedly out of the room on her bike.

		Leaving Jack and Kate alone again...

					KATE
			   You missed the whole 
			   thing, Jack.  The 
			   pancakes, the 
			   presents...you spent six 
			   hours putting that bike 
			   together and you didnt 
			   even get to see the look 
			   on Annies face when she 
			   opened it...

		Jack sees the disappointment on her face...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   You missed Christmas, 
			   Jack.

		Jack looks down, almost ashamed...he relents, giving in 
		to the moment...

					JACK
			   Im...Im sorry.

		Kate looks at him.  He seems sincere enough...

					KATE
			   Look, we dont have time 
			   for this right now, well 
			   talk about it later.  Now 
			   get dressed...
				(pointing to his 
				 outfit)
			   Youre not wearing that 
			   to the Thompsons party.  
			   I dont care how 
			   hilarious you think it 
			   is...

					JACK
			   Party?  Oh no, I cant go 
			   to a party...

					KATE
			   You look forward to this 
			   party all year.  Whats 
			   with you today?

					JACK
			   Trust me on this Kate.  I 
			   really dont think going 
			   to a party is the right 
			   move for me at the 
			   present time.

		Kate looks at him a moment, then shakes her head.

					KATE
			   Fine.  Do whatever you 
			   want.

		She picks up the phone, starts dialing...

					JACK
			   What are you doing?

					KATE
			   Telling my mother she 
			   doesnt have to stay with 
			   the kids.

					JACK
			   Why not?

					KATE
			   Because youll be here.

		Kate just looks at him.

					JACK
			   Ill be ready in ten 
			   minutes.

		He walks past her...toward a hallway door, Kate 
		watching him...

		He opens the door...its a closet.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Christ...
				(turning around)
			   Where the hell is the 
			   bathroom?

					KATE
			   Funny, Jack.  Im 
			   laughing on the inside.

    39	INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

		The light comes on...

		Jack walks in, looks in the mirror, determined to 
		collect himself...but somethings not right...

		He glances around...the bathroom is small and its 
		cluttered with Kates razors, loofah, skin creams...

		...none of this stuff is his...

		...he looks in the mirror again, his face revealing a 
		forlorn sense of displacement...

		...he stares at himself until...he starts to lose it... 
		anger, confusion...sadness...finally, he begins breaking down...

		After a moment, he turns on the water, rinsing his 
		face...

    40	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack at the closet door, looking at a row of Hagar 
		slacks, Docker sport coats and imitation leather 
		shoes...

		He reaches in and touches the fabric on one of the 
		sport coats.

					JACK
			   This is just...
				(searching for 
				 the words)
			   ...this is sub-par...

		Annie appears at the bedroom door, watching Jack at the 
		closet.

		He turns...sees Annie watching him...a look 
		exchanged... then, Annie runs away...

		Jack turns back to the closet and mournfully takes a 
		pair of the slacks...

    41	EXT. THOMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT

		Jack and Kate, a casserole dish in her hand, walk up 
		the path to this tacky but large house, its outside 
		decorated with the most garish display of Christmas 
		decorations this side of Pasaic.

		Kate RINGS the doorbell...

		EVELYN THOMPSON, 30s, wearing a dress thats a bit too 
		tight and a bit too low cut, opens the door...

					EVELYN
			   Kate!  Jack!
				(turning around, 
				 to guests)
			   Everybody, Jack and Kate 
			   are here!

		Jack looks right past her...to the house filled with 50 
		GUESTS.

		A loud WHOOP from the guests...Jack has the look of a 
		condemned man on his face as he follows Kate inside...

    41A	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

		As Kate heads into the living room, Evelyn takes Jacks 
		arm...

					EVELYN
				(suggestively)
			   Like the dress...?

					JACK
				(glancing at it)
				 Its lovely...

					EVELYN
				(a satisfied smile)
			   I thought I saw you 
			   notice it at the kids 
			   recital.

		Jack shoots her a confused look...then walks in, trying 
		to catch up with Kate...

    42	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

		The party is in full swing, Christmas music in the 
		b.g., GUESTS talking, laughing, drinking egg nog...

		Jacks eyes dart around the room...its large, neater 
		than his and Kates house but still very lived in...The 
		Thompson KIDS run in and out of the room, playing with 
		new toys... nobody is wearing or eating anything 
		imported from Europe, but everyones having a good 
		time...

		...everyone except for Jack, standing with Arnie and 
		THE GUYS, having his ear chewed off by NICK CARELLI, a 
		walking advertisement for Levis Cotton Dockers...

					NICK
			   Did you see Van Horn last 
			   night?  This kids gonna 
			   single-handedly save 
			   basketball in the state 
			   of New Jersey...

					JACK
			   The Nets?  Youre kidding, 
			   right...?

		Nick looks at him in disbelief.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(recovering)
			   Well...theyre certainly 
			   due.

		BILL KRAMER, a huge pile of fried chicken wings on his 
		plate, tugs at Jacks shirt.

					BILL KRAMER
			   So tomorrows the big 
			   day, Jackie...

					JACK
			   Okay...why?

					BILL KRAMER
			   Triple bypass.  Im going 
			   under the knife.  I told 
			   you, didnt I?

					JACK
			   Triple bypass?
				(pointing to his 
				 plate)
			   You really think you 
			   should be eating all 
			   that?

					BILL KRAMER
			   Why not?  I figure Im 
			   going in for a cleaning 
			   tomorrow, I might as well 
			   load up on the fried 
			   stuff tonight...

					ARNIE
			   Good thinking, Bill.  
			   Have another drink.
				(whispering to Jack)
			   Hell be lucky if he 
			   lives through the 
			   night...

		Nick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of 
		Dutch Masters cigars.  He shows them to Jack, Jack nods 
		politely.  Nick eagerly hands him one...

		Nick lights Jacks cigar, then his own...enjoying that 
		first puff...smiling at Jack...Jack dutifully takes a 
		puff of the cigar...nods back at Nick...but its an 
		effort...

		Evelyn Thompson approaches, a tray of MUSHROOM PUFFS in 
		hand...

					EVELYN
				(holding out a 
				 puff to Jack)
			   Finger food...?

					JACK
			   I dont think so, thank 
			   you...

					EVELYN
				(suggestively)
			   Cmon, as soon as I put 
			   them down, youre gonna 
			   grab a couple...you 
			   always do...

		Kate sees Evelyn and Jack from her position on the 
		other side of the room...Kate watches as...

		Evelyn holds the puff up to Jacks mouth, slowly 
		putting it near his lips...

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			   Let me.  Theyll melt in 
			   your mouth...

		He instinctively opens his mouth as Evelyn pushes the 
		treat inside...

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			   Good?

		On Jacks face...if freezer burn were a facial 
		expression, this would be it...

					JACK
				(forcing a smile) 
			   Theyre great!  Thank 
			   you!

		...Evelyn licks her fingers suggestively then hands 
		Jack the entire tray with a sexy smile...

		A raised eyebrow from Kate, still watching...

					EVELYN
			   Mushroom puffs arent the 
			   only thing I do well...

					JACK
			   Well do whatever it is 
			   you do well, and 
			   just...just do it.  
			   Excuse me...

		Evelyn nods as Jack walks toward the staircase...

		Kate follows Jack with her eyes as he climbs the 
		stairs...

    43	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, DEN - NIGHT

		Jack is sitting on the arm of a couch filled with 
		guests coats, talking on a FOOTBALL SHAPED 
		telephone...the tray of mushroom puffs on the table...

					JACK
				(loudly, into phone)
			   ...what do you mean he 
			   wont come to the phone?!
				(standing, indignant)
			   Do you realize how much 
			   money Ive made for that 
			   sonuvabitch in the last 
			   eight years?!

		Click.  A dial tone.  Jack slams the phone down...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Damnit!

		He slams the phone again...and again...and again...

					KATE (O.S.)
			   Jack...?

		Jack turns, sees Kate standing in the doorway, watching 
		him take his frustrations out on the phone, concern on 
		her face.

					KATE
			   Are you sure youre 
			   okay...?

		A forced smile from Jack.

					JACK
			   Yes, Im fine.  Its just 
			   this god awful football 
			   phone!  Who has a phone 
			   like this anyway?!

					KATE
				(doubtful)  
			   Uh huh...

		Kate notices the tray of mushroom puffs on the table.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   You must really love 
			   Evelyns mushroom puffs, 
			   huh?
				(with a wink)
			   You know theyre not 
			   real...

		She turns and leaves...Jack looks at her, confused...

    44	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack comes down the stairs, a lost look in his eyes.  
		He looks across the room and sees...

		Kate, with a group of GUESTS, looking great in her 
		jeans and white blouse, the center of attention.

		Jack passes through the guests, people waving to him, 
		slapping him on the back as he approaches Kate...

		He catches Kates eye...she gives him a subtle smile.

					KATE
				(to guests)
			   ...then she asks me to 
			   put this sweater on.  
			   What choice do I have, 
			   right?

		Jack watches as Kate charms the crowd...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   But as Im slipping it on 
			   I notice shes misspelled 
			   the word lawyers.
				(laughing)
			   I had to go through the 
			   entire day wearing a hand 
			   embroidered sweater that 
			   said, Non-Profit Layers 
			   Do It For Free.

		The guests laugh again.  Even Jack finds himself 
		laughing, until...

					JACK
				(to Kate, off-hand)
			   So youre a lawyer...?

		A chuckle from the group.  Kates confused.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   A non-profit lawyer...

		People are starting to LAUGH.

					KATE
				(a little embarrassed)
			   Jack...

					JACK
			   Pro bono.  You dont get 
			   paid at all.  Nobody 
			   makes a dime.  Well, 
			   bravo...

		Blank stares from everyone, including Kate...

		CUT TO:

    45	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, FOYER - LATE NIGHT

		Kate and Jack walk in the front door...the dog greets 
		them happily, jumping up on Jack, a weary look on his 
		face.

					KATE
			   I better go wake my
			   mother...

		Kate grabs a leash off a hook and hands it to Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Here you go...

					JACK
			   Youre kidding me...

					KATE
			   Shes your dog, Jack.

					JACK
			   No, shes not.

					KATE
			   Fine, shes the kids 
			   dog.  Lets go wake Josh, 
			   see if he wants to walk 
			   her.

					JACK
			   But its twenty degrees 
			   outside...

					KATE
				(sympathetic)
			   Youre having a bad day, 
			   Ill go with 
			   you...actually, theres 
			   no way in hell youre 
			   gettin me back out 
			   there...

		Jack looks at the dogs face.  Lucy couldnt be more 
		excited.  Finally, Jack shakes his head and takes the 
		leash.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(heading up the 
				 stairs)
			   Make sure you reward her 
			   verbally when she does a 
			   number two...

		CUT TO:

    46	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

		The sound of CRICKETS.

		Jack, wearing a down jacket, is being dragged down the 
		street by Lucy, his breath condensing in the cold 
		winter air.  The dog sniffs at a hydrant and a couple 
		of garbage cans, but isnt doing her business.

					JACK
			   Figure it out...Im s
			   crewed...dont have to 
			   be a genius to figure 
			   that out...

		The dog stops, sniffing at a manicured lawn...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Lucy)
			   Its as good a place as 
			   any...

		But the dog keeps moving, pulling Jack with her.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   ...but obviously not up 
			   to your high standards...
				(to himself)
			   Okay...he said youre 
			   working on a new deal 
			   now...fine, youve done a 
			   thousand deals, whats 
			   the first thing you do?

		Lucys sniffing around someones Christmas display but 
		Jacks too wrapped up in his thought process to notice.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Triage.  Its your 
			   signature.  You survey 
			   the damage, find out 
			   everything you can, you 
			   probe, leave nothing to 
			   chance.  Im just gonna 
			   have to go detective.  
			   How did you get 
			   Mentadent?  You learned 
			   everything there was to 
			   know about toothpaste and 
			   then you pounced...

		Jack narrows his eyes, thinking about that deal...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats our play here...

		Resolute, Jack turns to the dog.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   If you could take a dump 
			   some time in this 
			   century, then we could go 
			   home where its warm...

		Jack looks around at the unfamiliar houses...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   That is if I can even 
			   remember how to get 
			   home...
				(to Lucy)
			   You remember, dont you 
			   girl?

		But the dog ignores him, dragging Jack along...

    47	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Kate is in bed, fast asleep.

		Jack walks into the room, his face still red from the 
		cold outside.  He looks over at Kate, sleeping happily.

		He takes off his shirt and khakis, laying them neatly 
		on the chair.  He looks over at the pair of flannel 
		pajamas folded on the dresser.  He shakes his head, 
		resigned, then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed...

		CHAPTER SIX - BEING A PARENT
	
    48	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

		Morning light streams into the room.  The clock reads, 
		7:14.

		Jack opens his eyes  a burst of light hitting them 
		from the window...like the morning light in his 
		Manhattan loft...

		He reaches across the bed...its empty...

		A smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on 
		the pillow...maybe it was only a day...Then...

		The sound of a baby CRYING from the next room...A 
		pained look on Jacks face as he realizes hes still in 
		Jersey.

		Now the baby is WAILING...Jack lies still a moment, 
		hoping itll stop...it doesnt.  Then, he hears the 
		sound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom.

		He gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom...

    49	INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

		The shower is running, a tape player is BLASTING Beast 
		of Burden.  Kate is in the shower SINGING LOUDLY with 
		the song...

					JACK
			   Hello?

		No answer...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(louder, over music)
			   Hello!

					KATE
				(singing)
			   ...my feet are hurtin...

					JACK
				(yelling)
			   HEY!

		Finally, the music is turned down and Kate pulls the 
		shower curtain open...

		Jack sees her naked body...raises an eyebrow...thats 
		something hes missed...then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Uh...that babys crying...

					KATE
				(unimpressed)
			   And...?

		...her expression makes Jack turn his gaze from her 
		naked body.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Dont give me that look, 
			   Jack, Tuesdays your day 
			   and you know it.  And try 
			   to get Josh to day care 
			   on time, okay?  He missed 
			   the macaroni painting 
			   last week...

		She closes the curtain and turns the radio back up.

		CUT TO:

    50	INT. JOSHS ROOM - MORNING

		Annies watching from a baby-size Laz-E-Boy lounger 
		as...

		Jack, in a robe, stands in front of a changing table, 
		Josh laying happily on his back, playing with a set of 
		plastic keys.

		Jack takes a fresh Huggies diaper and puts it next to 
		the baby.  He surveys Josh, scratching his chin and 
		rubbing his hands like Indiana Jones.  Josh playfully 
		grabs at Jacks nose.

		He looks over to Annie.  Shes still staring at him 
		like hes a Martian.  He looks at the instructions on 
		the box of Huggies.

					JACK
			   Pull tape...

		Jack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape, then 
		gingerly pulls them apart, releasing the diaper from 
		the babys bottom, and seeing whats inside.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Holy mother of god!

		Jack holds the diaper out away from him, searching for 
		a place to put it.  Annie points to a Diaper Genie by 
		the dresser.

		Jack throws the diaper in, then quickly replaces the 
		lid.  Annie points to the container of Baby Wipes.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   You must be kidding...

		Annie stares at him a beat.  Then...

					ANNIE
			   Youre not really our 
			   dad, are you?

		Jack turns to her.  Shes looking back at him with 
		complete earnestness.  They stare at each other another 
		moment.  Then...

					JACK
			   No, Im not.

		A look of curiosity from Annie.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   I work on Wall Street, 
			   you know with the big 
			   buildings...?

		No response from Annie...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   I live in an apartment 
			   house with a doorman, I 
			   can buy just about 
			   anything I want...

		Annie nods at Jack, still suspicious.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   This isnt my real life.  
			   Its just a glimpse...

					ANNIE
			   Wheres my real dad?

					JACK
			   I dont know...

		A concerned look on Annies face, Jacks petrified that 
		shes about to cry.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   But dont worry, he loves 
			   you and Im sure hell be 
			   back very soon...
				(to himself)
			   ...very, very soon...

		Annie approaches Jack, climbing up on a little chair 
		and tugging firmly at his hair.

					ANNIE
			   They did a pretty good 
			   job.

					JACK
			   Who did?

					ANNIE
			   The aliens...In the 
			   mother ship.  You look 
			   just like him.

					JACK
			   Uhh...thanks...slightly 
			   better looking though, 
			   right?

		Annies now stone faced, trying to decide about Jack.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Youre not going to start 
			   crying, are you?  Because 
			   Im not really sure I 
			   could deal with that 
			   right now.

		She thinks about it for a moment.

					ANNIE
			   Do you like kids?

					JACK
			   On a case by case 
			   basis...

					ANNIE
			   You know how to make 
			   chocolate milk?

					JACK
			   I think I could figure it 
			   out.

					ANNIE
			   You promise not to kidnap 
			   me and my brother and 
			   implant stuff in our brains?

					JACK
			   Sure.

		Beat.  Then...a smile from Annie.

					ANNIE
			   Welcome to earth.

    51	INT. MINI-VAN - MORNING

		Jacks driving, Annie buckled in the front seat...

		Josh, in the baby seat, looks like he was dressed by 
		monkeys  his shirt buttons are off by one, and theyre 
		clearly supposed to be in the back.

					ANNIE
			   Stop here...

		Jack stops the van outside the Playland Day Care 
		Center.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   This is day care.  Its 
			   where babies go when 
			   their parents are at 
			   work.

					JACK
			   Check...

		He gets out of the van...

    52	EXT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

		...he pulls Josh out and walks quickly toward the 
		building, holding the baby away from his body.

		He gets to the door and holds Josh out to the DAY CARE 
		LADY.  She stares at Joshs outfit...

					JACK
			   Do I get a receipt or 
			   something...?

		The woman looks at Jack like hes crazy.

    53	EXT. YMCA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

		The mini-van pulls up to the drop-off point at this 
		suburban New Jersey Y.  Annie opens the door.

					ANNIE
			   I have winter camp until 
			   four, then ballet until 
			   five thirty.

					JACK
			   Five thirty.  Okay.

					ANNIE
			   Try not to be late 
			   because kids dont like 
			   to be the last one picked 
			   up.

					JACK
			   Got it.  Good tip.

					ANNIE
			   Bye...

		CHAPTER SEVEN - A TIRE SALESMAN

		Jack watches her as she runs toward the building.  
		Then...

					JACK
				(calling out window)
			   Hey!  Annie!

		Annie turns back toward him.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Where do I go now?

					ANNIE
			   Big Eds.

					JACK
			   Big Eds?  Big Eds 
			   Tires?
				(suspicious)
			   Why...?

					ANNIE
			   Thats where you work.

		A beat.  Then...

					JACK
			   You mean I sell tires...

		She shrugs her shoulders and walks off.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats what I do.  Im a 
			   tire salesman...

		CUT TO:

    54	INT. MINI-VAN - A LITTLE LATER

		Jacks driving down a busy commercial street when he 
		spots something a hundred yards down the road...

					JACK
			   Good Lord...

		...a huge, three-story-tall plastic likeness of Big Ed 
		Reynolds, ten gallon hat, lassoing a tire...

    55	EXT. BIG EDS TIRES - MOMENTS LATER

		Jack approaches Big Eds from the parking lot...slowly, 
		taking it all in...

		Its like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme.  A big retail 
		store for tires and auto parts, and a repair bay for 
		everything from alignments to brake jobs...

		Jack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR, 40s, a 
		Guatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls, stands 
		with TOMMY the salesman.

					TOMMY
			   Hey Jack, you happen to 
			   know the stock number on 
			   those new Michelin X1's?

					JACK
			   Uh...lemme get back to 
			   you on that one...
				(looking at his 
				 name tag)
			   Tommy...

					HECTOR
				(to Tommy)
			   Thomas, why you bother 
			   Jack about that.  Look it 
			   up yourself...
				(to Jack)
			   Okay Jack, we talk 
			   later...

		Jack nods amiably then continues into the store...

    56	INT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		Jack walks in...looks around...the store is teeming 
		with activity, a post-holiday sale in progress...

		Big Ed, in his signature ten gallon hat, sees Jack from 
		behind the counter...

					BIG ED
			   Jack my boy!  You are 
			   looking mighty worse for 
			   the wear...Hey, guess who
			   I played bridge with two 
			   nights ago...?

		Jack stares blankly at Big Ed...

					BIG ED (CONTD) 
			   Hell, youll never 
			   guess.  One Sydney 
			   Potter.  Thats Sydney 
			   Potter, Chief Executive 
			   Officer of BuyRite 
			   Transport.  Only the 
			   third largest trucking 
			   company in the state.  I 
			   even let the sonuvabitch 
			   win, which wasnt easy 
			   because the guys been 
			   bashed in the head by 
			   Teamsters so many times 
			   his brains like 
			   porridge.  Anyhoo, hes 
			   looking for a new parts 
			   supplier... we can handle 
			   that kind of volume, 
			   right?

		Jack considers this briefly.

					JACK
			   Im gonna have to get 
			   back to you on that...Ed.

		Big Ed makes a gun gesture with his forefinger, winking 
		at Jack, then turns back to the activity at the counter 
		as...

		Jack spots KENNY, a very young sales associate, walking 
		by.  He reaches out and taps Kenny on the shoulder.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Do I have a private 
			   office somewhere in the 
			   building?

					KENNY
			   Uh...sure Jack...
				(nervously pointing)
			   Right back there...

					JACK
			   Thank you.

		Jack walks into the office with his name on the door...

    57	INT. JACKS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Theres no Stairmaster here, no leather sofa or 
		bar...its small, cramped and cluttered, the walls 
		littered with tire inventory and price lists...

		Jack takes a slow, sad lap around the office.

		He makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of 
		the room and sits down behind it...

		On the desk are photos of Jack, Kate and the kids, a 
		plastic Michelin Man model, a tire-themed day calendar 
		and a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER, the word, 
		Bowlers Do It In An Alley embossed on its base...

		He surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top 
		drawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking 
		inside...

		He sees the bottom line and winces, then puts it 
		back...

		Jack picks up the Bowlers Do It In An Alley figurine 
		and gives it a good look...

					JACK
			   Bowlers do it in an 
			   alley?...Non profit 
			   lawyers do it for free... 
			   what is it with these 
			   people?  Dont they 
			   realize this refers to 
			   sex?

		He replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer 
		where he spots a bottle of Glenfiddich.  He lifts it 
		out...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   At least you splurged on 
			   some decent scotch...

		He takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot.  He 
		drinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the 
		cup, throwing it toward the NETS basketball 
		hoop/garbage can near the door.

		He misses...

		He looks more closely at the photographs...most are 
		family photos, a happy Jack with Kate, with Annie at 
		the pony rides, at Joshs birth...in every one of them, 
		Jack is smiling...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Jack in 
				 the photo)
			   What are you smiling 
			   about...?

		He turns his head...spots a small plaque on the wall 
		behind him.  It reads, Jack Campbell - E.F. Hutton #1 
		Junior Sales Associate, 1988.  Jack raises an 
		eyebrow...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Number one...not bad.

		He grabs it off the wall and looks at it more 
		carefully...

					JACK (CONTD)

			   1988...?  I was in London 
			   in 1988...

		Jacks jarred into reality...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Jack in the photo)
			   You never went to London...
				(picking up the photo)
			   ...you never got on that 
			   plane...

		He stays there a moment...in shock.  Then...

		The P.A. system comes to life...

					ESTELLE
				(over P.A.)
			   Jack to mag 
			   wheels...Jack, youre 
			   needed in mag wheels, 
			   customer waiting!

		CUT TO:

    58	INT. BIG EDS TIRES, MAIN FLOOR - MINUTES LATER

		Kenny leading Jack toward the Mag Wheels section.

					JACK
			   ...I was the number one 
			   junior sales associate at 
			   E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did 
			   you know that?

					KENNY
			   No, I didnt...thats 
			   great.

					JACK
			   Thats the kind of thing 
			   you can really build 
			   on...

					KENNY
			   Uh huh...

					JACK
			   I mean sales has always 
			   been a feeder for M and 
			   A, always...

		They approach Mag Wheels where TOMMY, a slick sales 
		associate, stands with a CUSTOMER looking at the 
		displays...

					KENNY
			   Here we are, mag wheels...
				(a little concerned)
			   Hey Jack, are you sure 
			   youre okay?

					JACK
			   Well, Im just a little 
			   confused right now about 
			   why I work here...

		Kenny looks at him nervously.

					KENNY
			   Uh...I just started here 
			   last Tuesday.

		Jack nods compassionately.  Kenny takes off leaving 
		Jack alone with his thoughts as Tommy approaches with 
		the customer.

					TOMMY
				(to the customer)
			   So youre all set on the 
			   Skip Shift eliminator and 
			   the Brembo rotors.  
			   Jacks our point man on 
			   alloy wheels...

					JACK
				(turning to Tommy)
			   Do you know why do I work 
			   here...?

					TOMMY
			   Because youre the best 
			   damn tire guy in the 
			   state of New Jersey...
				(proudly, to the 
				 customer)
			   Jack taught me everything 
			   I know about the 
			   business...

		The customer nods, impressed.

					JACK
			   I taught you the business?

		Another nod to the customer.

					TOMMY
			   And hes a crack-up.

					JACK
			   Everything I taught you.  
			   I want to hear it all, 
			   right now.

		Tommys confused.

					CUSTOMER
			   Hey, Im ready to buy 
			   here...

					JACK
				(to the customer)
			   What do you want?

					CUSTOMER
			   I want some alloy wheels.

		Jack grabs one of the alloy rims off the shelf, holding 
		it out to the customer.

					JACK
			   Here.  These are great.  
			   Youll need four.

		The customer takes the wheel from Jack, looks at it 
		confused...

					CUSTOMER
			   But I dont like these...

					JACK
			   Hey, you heard the guy, 
			   Im the best damn tire 
			   guy in the state of New 
			   Jersey.
				(turning to Tommy)
			   Everything.

					TOMMY
			   Okay...
				(hesitating)
			   Rule number one, the 
			   customer is always 
			   right...

		A satisfied smirk from the customer.

    59	INT. BIG EDS TIRES, JACKS OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

		Jack is behind his desk, his tie loosened, on the 
		phone...

					JACK
				(into phone)
			   ...I have no idea what 
			   our inventory level is, 
			   thats why Im asking 
			   you...

		A KNOCK at the door...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Look, just send us what 
			   you sent us last month, 
			   okay...?  And keep doing 
			   that until further 
			   notice...

		He hangs up the phone as the door opens.  Big Ed sticks 
		his head in...

					BIG ED
			   Got a minute, Jack?

					JACK
			   Ive got all the time in 
			   the world...

		Big Ed walks in, followed by SYDNEY POTTER, 60s, a 
		tough looking man...

					BIG ED
			   Jack, meet Sydney Potter, 
			   BuyRite Transport, one of 
			   Jerseys top 
			   businessmen...

		Potter extends a hand, Jack rises from his chair, 
		trying to place the name.  Then...

					JACK
			   ...and a helluva bridge 
			   player.  Eds told me a 
			   lot about you...

		They shake hands.  Potter nods his head at Jack, 
		immediately impressed.  Big Ed is beaming.

					POTTER
				(in a heavy Jersey 
				 accent)
			   Lucky in cards, lucky in 
			   business, lucky in love.  
			   My cup runneth over...
				(to Big Ed)
			   Hes a nice looking 
			   boy...

					BIG ED
			   My daughters no slouch 
			   either...

		A smile from Potter, then a serious look.

					POTTER
			   Lets cut to the chase, 
			   Jack.  Big Ed tells me 
			   youre the grease that 
			   makes the wheels turn 
			   around here.  I need a 
			   new parts supplier for my 
			   fleet.  You seem to have 
			   the parts.  That we 
			   know.  What we dont know 
			   is why the hell I should 
			   buy them from you.

		Potter stares Jack down.  But Jacks not about to be 
		intimidated by him.  He pauses, matching Potters 
		stare.  Then...

					JACK
			   I have no idea...

		A surprised look from Potter.  An anxious laugh from 
		Big Ed.

					BIG ED
				(nervous)
			   Cmon Jack...

					JACK
				(to Potter)
			   I mean it.  From what I 
			   can tell, were a mom and 
			   pop operation, were 
			   already over-extended in 
			   sales, and any price 
			   advantage we could offer 
			   would easily be matched 
			   by a larger supplier...

		Jack continues to stare down Potter.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   So like I said, I dont 
			   have any idea why you 
			   should buy your parts 
			   from us...

		The staring match continues.  Big Eds getting more 
		nervous.  Potters the first to blink.

					POTTER
			   Okay, you got my 
			   attention...

					JACK
			   Except for rule number 
			   one...

		Jack smiles.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   The customer is always 
			   right.  A cliché?  Sure. 
			   The difference is, we 
			   mean it.  Were small, we 
			   need our customers.  We 
			   cant afford to 
			   disappoint them, ever. 
			   Yeah, you could go to 
			   some leviathan supplier, 
			   probably save a few 
			   pennies on the price of 
			   oil filters, but with us 
			   you get more than a 
			   supplier, you get a 
			   bridge partner...

		A smile from Potter.  Jack gives Ed a wink.  Ed 
		watches, thrilled...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   You want to bid hearts, 
			   were right there with 
			   you.  You feel the need 
			   to redouble, youre not 
			   going to get any argument 
			   from us...

		Potter nods at Jack.  Jack moves in for the kill.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   The big guys may have the 
			   high cards, but you know 
			   as well as I do, Sydney, 
			   high cards dont always 
			   take the trick.

		Potter pauses a minute, then...

					POTTER
				(to Big Ed, 
				 re: Jack)
			   I like him...

		Big Ed smiles, letting out a relieved sigh.

					BIG ED
				(a wink to Jack)
			   Thats my boy...
				(an arm around Potter)
			   Cmon, lemme show you the 
			   rest of the ranch...

		Big Ed and Potter exit the office...

					BIG ED (CONTD)
				(turning back to Jack)
			   Nice shootin, Jack...

		...leaving Jack there with a satisfied smile on his 
		face.

    60	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

		Jack is in bed watching CNBC...On the TV a young woman 
		REPORTER at the anchors desk...

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   ...advancers led

			   fueled by the latest 
			   round of merger mania to 
			   hit Wall Street...

		The Global Health Systems and MedTech logos appear on a 
		graphic in the corner of the screen...

					CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
			   ...when Global Health 
			   Systems and MedTech 
			   Pharmaceutical announced 
			   their intentions to join 
			   forces in a massive one 
			   hundred and twenty two 
			   billion dollar stock swap 
			   deal.  Though neither 
			   side expressed 
			   significant regulatory 
			   concerns at the 
			   announcement press 
			   conference, it is 
			   believed that both the 
			   FDA and the FTC will be 
			   closely scrutinizing the 
			   marriage, the largest 
			   ever in the health care 
			   industry.  When asked 
			   about possible anti-
			   competitive implications, 
			   Global Chairman Bob 
			   Thomas referred reporters 
			   to P.K. Lassiter and 
			   Company President Alan 
			   Mintz, the original 
			   architect behind the 
			   deal...

		Jack stares in shock as the image changes to a super 
		confident looking Mintz shaking Bob Thomas hand at the 
		press conference.

					CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
			   Ironically, Mintz first 
			   met Thomas at a Lamaze 
			   class...

					JACK
			   A Lamaze class...!?

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   ...while coaching their 
			   pregnant wives, Mintz and T
			   homas struck up a 
			   dialogue about the need 
			   for consolidation in the 
			   rapidly growing health 
			   care industry and two 
			   months later, the deal 
			   with MedTech was born...

					JACK
			   What?!  Thats my deal?

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   In other business news, 
			   U.S. Labor Department 
			   officials announced today
			   that two hundred and 
			   seventy-five thousand new
			   jobs were created last 
			   month, twenty-five 
			   thousand less than 
			   economists were 
			   predicting, leading to a 
			   mild rally in the bond 
			   markets before midday.  
			   But as the trading 
			   session drew to a close, 
			   the profit takers stepped 
			   in and the long bond 
			   closed at ninety seven 
			   even, up only two ticks, 
			   the yield inching down to 
			   six point zero seven 
			   percent...

		Kate comes into the room from the hallway wearing only 
		Jacks NYU sweatshirt...

					KATE
			   The kids are asleep...

		She goes over to the window and draws the blinds.  Jack 
		looks up at her, nods, then goes back to the TV.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Jack.  I said the kids 
			   are asleep...

					JACK
				(distracted)
			   Well thats just 
			   great...those little 
			   monkeys can be a real 
			   handful...

		Kate shuts off the TV.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Hey!  I was watching 
			   that!

					KATE
			   I thought we had a deal 
			   about you watching CNBC 
			   in bed.

					JACK
			   Im working on a new deal 
			   now...

		Kate throws a Kate Bushs The Sensual World into the 
		CD player.

					KATE
			   Fine, but not tonight...

		She climbs onto the bed, a seductive look on her face.

					JACK
			   Wait a second.  You want 
			   me, dont you?

					KATE
			   That is the general idea, 
			   yes...

		Kate starts kissing him...but Jacks a little 
		uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy...he pulls back, 
		a little nervous.

					JACK
			   Shouldnt we grab some 
			   dinner first?  Maybe a 
			   bottle of wine...?

					KATE
			   Its ten thirty, Jack.  
			   By eleven youre gonna be 
			   sprawled out on the bed 
			   snoring your head off.  
			   We dont have time for 
			   wining and dining.

					JACK
			   Whatever you say...honey.

		She starts kissing him again...but this time he just 
		goes with it, and as her hands run through his hair 
		hes brought back to a different time and place...

		Jack momentarily pulls back and looks at her...its 
		like the first time hes really looked at her in eleven 
		years...


					JACK (CONTD)
			   God...youre beautiful...

		She smiles at him, almost uncomfortable with the 
		compliment...

					KATE
			   Thanks, Jack...

					JACK
			   No, Im serious...youre 
			   really stunning...

					KATE
			   This is good stuff, Jack, 
			   keep it coming...

					JACK
			   I mean back in college, 
			   you were a very pretty 
			   girl, theres no question 
			   about that.  But this...
				(lost in her)
			   ...youve really grown 
			   into a beautiful woman...

		Jack stares at her, entranced...Kate pulls back, 
		reacting to the intensity in his stare...

					KATE
			   How can you do that?

					JACK
				(nervous)
			   Do what?

					KATE
			   Look at me like you 
			   havent seen me every day 
			   for the last twelve 
			   years...

		Jack freezes.  Theres love in her eyes but its not 
		meant for him...

		She kisses him...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Dont move.

		She gets up off the bed and heads for the bathroom...

		He looks around...not sure what to do...Finally...

		He turns onto his side and closes his eyes...

		Kate emerges from the bathroom, she sees Jack on the 
		bed, hears his breathing heavy with sleep...

		At once charmed and disappointed, Kate sighs.  She 
		turns off the CD player and heads into bed.

		She pulls the covers up over Jack, shutting off the 
		light... She puts an arm around him, kissing him 
		sweetly on the neck...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   night, honey...

		Close in on Jacks face...turned away from Kate...he 
		opens his eyes...looks down at her arm...loneliness on 
		his face...

		CHAPTER EIGHT - THE MENS DEPARTMENT

		DISSOLVE TO:

    61	EXT. MALL - DAY

		Its mid-January and all signs of the Christmas season are 
		gone except for the snow on the ground in the busy parking 
		lot.

    62	INT. MACYS, MENS DEPT. - DAY

		Kate, pushing Josh in the stroller and holding Annies 
		hand, passing through the Mens Dept., Jack lagging 
		behind, a bevy of shopping bags in hand and a 
		beleaguered look on his face.

					KATE
				(back to Jack)
			Were almost done here...

					ANNIE
			Mary Janes, Mom.  You 
			promised.

					KATE
			Thats right.  Okay, 
			lets make a quick stop 
			at the kids shoe 
			department, pick up my 
			watch from the battery 
			place, then Ill run into 
			the linen store...

		An unhappy look on Jacks face.

					JACK
			Why dont we just go to 
			all the stores?!

		Kate looks back at Jack.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Every single store in 
			this godforsaken shopping 
			mall.  We can go to them 
			all.

		Kate gives him a look.  Then...

					KATE
			You know what, Jack?!  
			Ill go with the kids.  
			Why dont you just hang 
			out here in the mens 
			department... okay?

		Jack glances at the Mens Dept., sighs and gives Kate a 
		nod.  She takes off with the kids...and then he sees 
		it...

		...the Zegna section.  Hes drawn to the neat rows of 
		beautiful suits like a moth to the light...

		He approaches the rack, pulls out a dark green suit, 
		gently touching the soft wool.

					SALESMAN (O.S.)
			Its perfect for your 
			frame...

		Jack turns and sees a SALESMAN standing behind him.

					SALESMAN 
			Would you like to try it 
			on?

		CUT TO:

    63	INT. MACYS MENS DEPT. - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack, at a mirror wearing the Zegna suit.  It is 
		perfect for his frame.  The color is spectacular, the 
		line is dazzling.

		Jack looks in the mirror, shutting everything else 
		out... its like hes seeing his old self...

					KATE (O.S.)
			You look amazing in that 
			suit...

		Jack snaps out of his trance.  He sees Kate standing 
		behind him, Annie and Josh happily playing a few feet 
		away.
					KATE
			I mean...wow...off the 
			charts great.

					JACK
			Its an unbelievable 
			thing.  Wearing this suit 
			actually makes me feel 
			like a better person.
				(taking one final 
				 look)
			Im gonna buy it...

		Kate raises an eyebrow, then looks at the price tag.

					KATE
			$2,400?!  Are you out of 
			your mind?

					JACK
				(pointing to Annies 
				 new Mary Janes)
			She got those shoes...

					KATE
			Those shoes were twenty 
			five dollars.  Cmon, 
			take it off.  Well go to 
			the food court and get 
			one of those funnel cakes 
			you like.

		Jack looks at her...its a moment of decision.

					JACK
			No.

		Kate looks at Jack, a little surprised.

					KATE
			No?

					JACK
			Do you have any idea what 
			my life is like?

					KATE
			Excuse me?

					JACK
			I wake up in the morning 
			covered in dog saliva...I 
			drop the kids off, spend 
			eight hours selling tires 
			retail...retail, Kate.

		Kate just stands here, aghast...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I pick up the kids, walk
			the dog, which by the 
			way, carries the added 
			bonus of carting away her
			monstrous crap...I play 
			with the kids, take out 
			the garbage, get six 
			hours of sleep if Im 
			lucky, and then it starts 
			all over again...and why 
			is it that I always have 
			to drive everyone 
			everywhere?  I spend 
			practically my entire day 
			in that slow as hell 
			mini-van listening to 
			Raffi tapes and trying to 
			figure out how the cup 
			holders work...Im sick 
			of it.

					KATE
			Really.

					JACK
			Whats in it for me?  
			Where are my Mary Janes?

		Kate stares at him, shaking her head...

					KATE
			Its sad to hear your 
			life is such a 
			disappointment to you, 
			Jack.

					JACK
			I cant believe its not 
			a disappointment to you!
				(letting it all out)
			Jesus, Kate, I couldve 
			been a thousand times the 
			man I became.  How could 
			you do this to me?  How 
			could you let me give up 
			on my dreams like this?!

		Kate stares at him in disbelief.  Then...

					KATE
			Who are you?

		Kates words pierce Jack...he has to avert his eyes.

					JACK
				(lowering his voice)
			Look, Im sorry.  Im 
			sorry I was such a saint 
			before and Im such a 
			prick now.  Maybe Im 
			just not the same guy I 
			was when we got 
			married...

					KATE
			Maybe youre not.  The 
			Jack Campbell I married 
			wouldnt need a $2400 
			suit to make himself feel 
			better about his life, 
			but if thats what its 
			gonna take, then buy it.  
			Just buy the goddamn 
			suit ...we can take the 
			money out of the kids 
			college fund.

		They stare at each other for a moment...a stand-off...

					JACK
			Forget it...
				(taking off the 
				 jacket)
			Well get a funnel cake.  
			Itll be the highlight of 
			my week...

    64	EXT. NEW JERSEY ROAD - NIGHT

		The blue mini-van makes its way down this road...

    65	INT. MINI-VAN - NIGHT

		Theres an icy silence in the car...Jack is behind the 
		wheel, Kate next to him looking out the window, anger 
		on her face...
 
		CHAPTER NINE - REMINISCING

		Jack checks the rear-view mirror, sees Annie and Josh 
		in the back, both asleep...

					JACK
				(to Kate)
			Listen, Im sorry about 
			that back in the store.  
			I really dont want to 
			fight with you...

		Kate just keeps looking out the window.

					JACK (CONTD)
			But you must sometimes 
			wonder how we ended up 
			here.  I mean back in 
			college, did you see 
			us...
				(looking around)
			...here...?

		She turns to him.

					KATE
			Ill give you this, life 
			has thrown us a few 
			surprises...

		A glimmer in Jacks eye...

					JACK
			It really has, hasnt 
			it?  So if you had 
			to...what would you say 
			was the biggest surprise?

		She glances at the kids sleeping in the back.

					KATE
			Well...Annie for one.

					JACK
			Surprise.  Were 
			pregnant...
				(a laugh)
			Yeah...that mustve 
			been...I mean that was 
			very unexpected.  But 
			what are you gonna do, 
			right?

					KATE
			I think it worked out 
			okay, dont you?

					JACK
			Sure.  I really like 
			Annie.

					KATE
			Good, Jack.  Maybe well 
			keep her.

					JACK
			No, I love Annie.  We had 
			a lot of good times, 
			didnt we?

					KATE
			We were young...
				(a nostalgic smile)
			Remember that little 
			place on Charles Street 
			we used to go to?

					JACK
			Charles Street?  In the 
			Village?  When we were 
			living in Greenwich 
			Village...?
				(off her nod)
			Great times.  Whyd we 
			ever leave?

					KATE
			You cant really raise a 
			kid in an apartment in 
			the Village...

		Jack nods, starting to piece it together.

					KATE (CONTD)
			The trek out to the 
			hospital every day didnt 
			help either...
				(looking at him)
			You were great.  
			Surviving the heart 
			attack was one thing...

					JACK
			You had a heart attack?

					KATE
				(a laugh)
			Jack, stop that. I'm
			still mad at you...
				(a sigh)
			...who knows what 
			wouldve happened if you 
			hadnt stepped in at the 
			store.

					JACK
			Thats why I work for Big 
			Ed?

		A look from Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(recovering)
			I mean, thats why I work 
			for Big Ed...

		Jack looks out at the road a moment, piecing it all 
		together in his mind.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(almost to himself)
			So we had a baby, Big Ed 
			had a heart attack, we b
			ought that house, and 
			Ive been working for him 
			ever since...Sayonara, 
			Wall Street.

		Kate looks at him a little strangely.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(turning to her)
			Our life in a nutshell...

					KATE
			If you want to look at it 
			that way...

					JACK
			How would you look at it?

		She glances again at the kids in the back seat, then at 
		Jack.

					KATE
			A great success story...

		A smile from Jack.  He admires her outlook even if he 
		cant bring himself to share it.

		DISSOLVE TO:

    66	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING

		A crowded suburban New Jersey bowling alley...

		Jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball, the 
		nickname The Hammer emblazoned over his bowling shirt 
		pocket...He approaches the line and throws the ball 
		down the lane...

		Its ugly...The ball caroms off the hardwood into the 
		gutter.

					JACK
			Damn...

					ARNIE
				(O.S., from behind)
			Jesus, Jack, this is a 
			league match, for gods 
			sake!

		Jack turns.  Arnie and the BOWLING TEAM are in the 
		scorekeeping area watching Jack make a mockery of the 
		sport.  Jack scowls.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Wheres your follow 
			through?  Wheres your 
			stance?

					JACK
			Hey, Im doing the best I 
			can...
				(under his breath)
			Id like to see you hit a 
			squash ball after 
			seventeen beers...

					ARNIE
			Youre right.  Why am I 
			so competitive!?  
			Compensation, I guess.  
			Look, just focus, Jack.  
			You can still pick up the 
			spare...

		Jack retrieves his ball, sets up, genuinely 
		concentrating...

					JACK
				(quietly, to 
				 himself)
			You are Jack Campbell.  
			Youre better than this 
			sport.  You shot the 
			rapids at Kenai.  You ran 
			with the bulls at 
			Pamplona.  You jumped out 
			of a plane over the 
			Mojave Desert, for 
			Christs sake.  You can 
			do this...

		Jack puts everything he has into the throw, heaving the 
		ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he 
		can muster...hitting the six pin and taking out four 
		others.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(screaming, excited)
			Yeah!!

		He turns, a fist pumped...But the guys could care 
		less...

					ARNIE
				(to TEAMMATE)
			Okay, Pete, youre up.

    67	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATE

		Jack walks out of the mens room, heading toward the 
		lounge.  He sees a familiar face walking toward him...a 
		woman in a sexy little bowling outfit, carrying a 
		bowling ball to a far lane.

					EVELYN
			Hi Jack...

		A moment of confusion as he tries to place the face.  
		Then...

					JACK
			Evelyn, right?

					EVELYN
			Very funny.  I saw you 
			out there on lane five.  
			What do you have the flu 
			or something?

					JACK
			Something like that.

					EVELYN
				(with a wink)
			Need a nurse?

					JACK
			Youre a nurse?

		Evelyn laughs.

					EVELYN
			If thats what you 
			want...

		She brushes past Jack, continuing to her lane...Jack 
		follows her with his eyes a moment, then...

					JACK
			Wait a second...

		She turns.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Are we...?

					EVELYN
			Are we what, Jack?

					JACK
			Is there something going 
			on between us?

		Evelyns surprised at Jacks directness.  She stands 
		there a beat, then walks back toward him.

					EVELYN
			Are we finally being 
			honest?

					JACK
			It would help me if we 
			were.

					EVELYN
			Okay, youre right, weve 
			been dancing around this 
			for years...

		Evelyn looks a little flush...she briefly fans her 
		face.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			God, my heart is racing.  
			Here goes...
				(a smile)
			When I get dressed for a 
			party and I know youre 
			going to be there... 
			well, lets just say I 
			dont go strapless 
			because my husband likes 
			it...

		An intrigued smile from Jack.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			Ive got six sets of snow 
			tires piled up in my 
			garage and I wont even 
			drive in the snow...And 
			our kids just happen to 
			be in the same ballet 
			class every year?

		She picks a piece of lint off his shirt.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			So, if youre asking me 
			whether Id like it to be 
			more, the answer is 
			yes...

		A look of surprise from Jack.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			...and Kate would never 
			have to know.

		Jack considers this for a moment.

					JACK
			Do I have your number?

		A wide smile from Evelyn.

					EVELYN
			Steves out of town with 
			the kids this week.  Why 
			dont you just stop by...

		She turns, leaving Jack standing there, watching her 
		sashay back to her lane.

    68	INT. BOWLING ALLEY, LOUNGE - SECONDS LATER

		Jack walks into the lounge, a little dazed.  He heads 
		over to Arnie whos having a beer at the bar.

					ARNIE
				(looking at Jack)
			Hey Jack, youre all 
			flush.  I guess that 
			seventy-one took a lot 
			outta you.

					JACK
				(sitting down)
			I just saw Evelyn 
			Thompson.

					ARNIE
			She is relentless.

					JACK
			She wants to have an 
			affair with me.

					ARNIE
			She said that?

					JACK
			Pretty much.

					ARNIE
			Oh yeah...
				(shaking his head)
			What is it about you?

					JACK
				(pushing over a 
				 napkin)
			So could you write down 
			her exact address?

					ARNIE
			Whoa...whoa...wait a 
			second, Jack.  Youre not 
			actually gonna cheat on 
			Kate?

					JACK
			It wouldnt really be 
			cheating...
				(off Arnies 
				 doubtful  look)
			Its complicated.

					ARNIE
			Look, maybe Im not as 
			good a consigliere as you 
			are but you have to trust 
			me on this one.  A little 
			flirtations harmless but 
			youre playing with fire 
			here.  The Fidelity Bank 
			and Trust is a tough 
			creditor.  You make a 
			deposit somewhere else, 
			they close your account 
			forever.

					JACK
			Im telling you, those 
			rules dont apply to me, 
			Arn.

					ARNIE
				(a chuckle)
			Screw the rules.  Im 
			talking about the choice.

		Jack looks at him curiously.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons 
			got no class.  She 
			doesnt marry Dr. Steve, 
			the womans living in a 
			trailer.

					JACK
			Hey, is that really 
			necessary?

					ARNIE
			All Im saying it there 
			isnt a guy in Union 
			County who wouldnt give 
			his left nut to be 
			married to Kate...

		Arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Ill see ya later, 
			Jack...

		He leaves Jack alone, thinking...

		CHAPTER TEN - CAKE WARS

    69	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - NIGHT

		Jack walks into the house carrying his bowling bag.  He 
		dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the 
		kitchen where...

		Kate is at the counter, her back to him, poring over 
		some legal documents.

					KATE
				(not looking up)
			How was the game, honey?

					JACK
				(opening the fridge)
			Long, boring, and 
			generally pretty sad.  
			Arnie seemed to enjoy 
			it...
				(peering inside)
			Hey, wheres that chocolate 
			cake...?

		Kate turns around, revealing a huge hunk of chocolate 
		cake on a plate in front of her, a bite ready to go 
		into her mouth.

					KATE
				(with a smile)
			You mean this chocolate 
			cake?

					JACK
			Thats my piece.  I was 
			saving it because I got 
			nauseated from that store 
			bought chicken.

		Kate takes the bite, a little piece of icing sticks to 
		the side of her mouth.

					KATE
			Its good...

		Jack approaches the counter.

					JACK
			Gimme that cake.

		She takes another bite.

					KATE
			No way.

		He makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out 
		where he cant reach it.

					JACK
			Cmon.

					KATE
			Sorry, Jack.  Its too 
			important to me.

		They stare each other down a moment.  Then...

		He tries to swipe the plate.  Kate jumps out of her 
		chair, running out of the kitchen with the cake, 
		laughing...

		Jack takes off after her...chasing her through the 
		house... just about the catch up to her when...

		She darts up the stairs, still laughing...he follows 
		her...

					JACK
			I want that cake!

		...reaches up...grabs her shirt...pulls her down 
		playfully on top of him...

					KATE
				(laughing)
			You want the cake!?

					JACK
				(out of breath)
			I want it...

		She looks at him, then takes the whole piece in her 
		hand and smooshes it right in his mouth...

		Beat.  Then, Jack starts laughing...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Thank you...

					KATE
			Its good, right?

		He takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her 
		mouth.

		They stay there a moment, lying on the stairs, feeding 
		each other cake, laughing.

		Jack leans back on the stairs.  He looks at Kates 
		face, practically covered in cake, smiling, and 
		realizes...

		...he hasnt laughed like this in thirteen years.  
		Then...

					JACK
			Are the kids asleep?

		A sexy smile from Kate...they start kissing 
		passionately right there on the steps...its heating 
		up...

					KATE
				(caught up in the 
				 moment)
			Say it, Jack...

					JACK
			What...?

					KATE
			Cmon, you know what I 
			like to hear...

					JACK
				(in the throes 
				 of passion)
			Yeah, baby, I know what 
			you like to hear...

					KATE
				(kissing him)
			Then say it...just say it 
			to me...!

					JACK
				(swept up in the 
				 moment)
			Oh yeah, youre a bad 
			girl, baby... You make me 
			so hot...Im gonna take 
			you to that special 
			place...

		Kate pulls away.

					KATE
			What...?

		Jack looks up at her, he can practically see the 
		passion drain from her face...

					JACK
			Not it...?

					KATE
			Nice, Jack.  Youre 
			sweeping me off my feet.

					JACK
			What? You make me hot...

		She gets up and heads up the steps, disappearing into 
		the bedroom...Jack shakes his head, frustrated.  Then, 
		he feels something licking at his hand...

		He looks down and sees Lucy standing next to him, 
		wagging her tail, looking up at Jack with an Ive 
		gotta go look on her face.  Jack heaves a sigh, 
		then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cmon, Lucy, maybe one of 
			us can get a little 
			relief tonight...

		He leads the dog toward the front door...

    70	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack is walking Lucy.  He passes a house that looks 
		familiar to him.  Then he sees it...

		...the name THOMPSON etched on the mailbox...

		Its the Thompson house, now sans the garish Christmas 
		decorations, a drying Christmas tree tied up on the 
		curb, ready to be picked up as garbage...

		Jack stops, pulling the dog back, looking up at the 
		house...

		He sees a light on in the upstairs bedroom...the faint 
		outline of a woman reading by the window...

		EVELYN THOMPSON...

		Jack looks around, sees the street is empty, then 
		nudges the dog, leading her up the path to the house.

		He gets to the front door...moves his hand up to the 
		doorbell...but its a tentative move...he keeps it 
		there a moment, perched at the button...but for some 
		reason he cant bring himself to push it...

		He looks down the street, toward his own house, then to 
		the window upstairs.  Finally, he turns...

					JACK
				(pulling the leash)
			Cmon, girl, lets go 
			home...

    71	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE FOYER - MINUTES LATER

		The front door opens and Jack walks in with Lucy on a 
		leash, his face red from the cold outside.

		He gives the dog a pat on the rump, then takes off his 
		coat, hanging it and the leash on a hook by the door...

		He walks through the quiet house, into the living room, 
		rubbing his hands together to warm them up.

		CHAPTER ELEVEN  HOME MOVIES

		He goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a 
		scotch, taking a sip, letting the alcohol warm him...

		He strolls through the room, looking at some of the 
		family photos framed and hanging on the wall, focusing 
		on his own face in the pictures, studying the 
		expressions...

		He moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf, 
		marked with titles like, Trip to Yosemite, 96" and 
		Joshs 1st Birthday.  He runs his fingers along the 
		tapes, stopping at one marked, Jack Singing.  His 
		eyes linger there a moment...

		He puts his drink down and pops the tape in the VCR...

		ON TV:

		Its a party for Kates birthday thrown at the Kramers 
		house...same crowd of people as the Christmas party, 
		cheesy Happy Birthday decorations.

		The image jerks up and down, surveying the crowd...

		Bill Kramer at the piano, playing some light cocktail 
		music ...Kate talking with a group of friends...

					ARNIE (O.S.)
			Jesus, Bill, this thing 
			is an antique.  Dont you 
			even have image 
			stabilization?

		Bill stops playing and looks up at Arnie.

					BILL KRAMER
			Four hundred bucks at Best 
			Buy, Arn.

		Then...Jack comes into frame, a confident smile on his 
		face.

					JACK
			And everyone knows image 
			stabilization is for the 
			weak...

		Jack is jarred by the image of himself on the video...

		Jack on TV...he smiles as Kate walks into frame, easily 
		putting an arm around Jack...

					ARNIE
			So Jack, its your wifes 
			birthday, got anything to 
			say to her?

					JACK
				(to Kate)
			Its your birthday?  
			Today?  Whats your 
			name?  Where were you 
			born?

					KATE
			Jack.

					JACK
			Wait a minute.  Youre my 
			wife?

		She slaps him playfully on the arm...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I do have one thing I 
			wanna say...

		Kate looks at him expectantly.  Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(singing to her)
			Oh those fingers in my 
			hair, that sly come 
			hither stare, strips my 
			conscience bare, its 
			witchcraft... 

		Jack doesnt have the greatest voice in the world but 
		hes not the least bit self-conscious...and Kate seems 
		to like it, theres a twinkle in her eye...some of the 
		guests focus their attention on Jack and Kate. 

		Jack winces, embarrassed, as he watches himself sing...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...and Ive got no 
			defense for it, that heat 
			is too intense for it, 
			what good would common 
			sense for it do...

		Bill Kramer still at the piano, chimes in with the 
		basic chords for Witchcract, sounding it out as he 
		goes along...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...Cause its 
			witchcraft, wicked 
			witchcraft...and although 
			I know its strictly 
			taboo...when you rouse 
			the need in me, my heart 
			says yes indeed in me, 
			proceed with what youre 
			leadin me to...

		The camera catches the reactions of guests in the 
		crowd... the women, smiles on their faces, wrapped up 
		in the romance of the moment.  Envy on the mens faces 
		as they watch Jack serenade his wife...

		A musical interlude from Bill as Jack takes off his 
		jacket...some HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd...Arnie 
		captures the image of Kate whistling at her husband...

		Arnie follows with the camera as Jack strolls in front 
		of the gathered guests... 

					JACK (CONTD)
			Its such an ancient 
			pitch, but one that Id 
			never switch, there aint 
			no nicer witch than 
			you...

		Jack watches himself move gracefully.  But its no 
		longer embarrassment on his face, its fascination...

		Back in the video, the camera catches Evelyn Thompson 
		watching longingly as Jack moves back toward 
		Kate...Evelyn cant take it anymore, she abruptly turns 
		and walks toward the kitchen...

		Jack raises an eyebrow...

		In the video...Jack approaches Kate, she couldnt have 
		a more delighted look on her face.  He picks up the 
		verse...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cause its witchcraft, 
			that koo koo 
			witchcraft...and although 
			I know its strictly 
			taboo...

		The camera pans across the crowd, even the men are 
		getting into it, focused on Jack as he sings lovingly, 
		unashamed, to his wife...Nick Careli mouths the words 
		along with Jack, almost as if hes studying him, 
		revering him...

		Jack watches the TV, seeing Nick do this...maybe he 
		underestimated his alter ego...

		On the video...Jack staring into Kates eyes...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...when you rouse the 
			need in me, my heart says 
			yes indeed to me, proceed 
			with what youre leadin 
			me to...

		Jack and Kate exchange a sexy smile...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Its such an ancient 
			pitch, but one that Id 
			never switch...

		Jack kisses her on the lips...HOOTS and HOLLERS from 
		the crowd.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cause theres no nicer 
			witch than you...

		Kate brushes a hand across Jacks face...

		Smash cut to Jack watching this...seeing the 
		connection, the heat between them...coveting it...

		Back to the video...the music building...the crowd 
		completely in the palm of Jacks hand...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...than you...

		The camera closes in on Jack and Kate as the music 
		builds to a crescendo...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...than you...

		A little musical flourish from Bill as the crowd breaks 
		out into huge CHEERS and APPLAUSE...

		Jack, watching this other version of himself in the video, 
		the center of attention, larger than life, focused on Kate...

		Back on video...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(speaking quietly 
				 to Kate)
			Happy Birthday 
			sweetheart...I love you.

		Kate leans over, giving Jack a deep kiss...OOHS and 
		AHHS from the crowd...but Jack and Kate are in their 
		own little world...

		Jack continues to watch himself on the video, his smile 
		fading, becoming a look of realization...then loss...

		A tear at the corner of his eye...

		The SOUND fades in Jacks head as the action in the 
		video continues...

		Hes left standing there...silent, still...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    72	INT. CAMPBELL MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

		Lucy licking Jacks face.  Jack pushes the dog 
		away...as...

		The ALARM RINGS.  Kate pushes the button to stop it.

					KATE
				(groggy)
			Time to get up, honey...

		Jack obliges without question, getting out of bed, 
		putting on a robe and slippers and exiting, still 
		practically half-asleep.

    73	INT. KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

		Jack walks into the kitchen.

		He turns on the Mr. Coffee, gets a bottle from the 
		fridge, throws it in the microwave, removes it, and 
		heads upstairs.

    74	INT. JOSHS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...into Joshs room.  Josh is wide awake, standing up 
		in his crib, like a prisoner in a cell.

		Jack gives him the bottle, pats his head perfunctorily, 
		and then walks out of the room...

		CHAPTER TWELVE - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY

    75	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...and back into the bedroom to find Kate, sitting on 
		the bed, a wrapped present in front of her and a wide 
		smile on her face.

		Jack stops, raising an eyebrow at the gift.  He looks 
		behind, as if to ask whether its for him, then back to 
		Kate.

					KATE
			Happy Anniversary, 
			honey...

		Terror on Jacks face.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(pushing the gift 
				 forward)
			Before you do whatever 
			crazy stunt youve got 
			planned I want you to 
			open mine...

		Jack musters up a smile, then approaches the gift.

					JACK
			Maybe I should wait...

					KATE
			No, open it...

		He hesitates, then begins unwrapping the package, 
		revealing...

		...a suit, similar in color and style to the Zegna 
		suit...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I found it at an outlet 
			store.  I know its a 
			knock-off, but I think 
			itll look great on 
			you...

					JACK
				(examining the label)
			Zeena...

		Jack is overcome with emotion...Yes, its a ZEENA, but 
		this is probably the nicest thing anyones ever done 
		for him...

					JACK (CONTD) 
				(tearing up)
			You really are 
			incredible...

					KATE
			Enjoy it, sweetheart...

		Jack looks at Kates expectant face, suddenly 
		remembering how truly screwed he is.

					JACK
			Youre probably expecting 
			something from me...

		Hes sweating bullets...watching as Kate gets a quizzical 
		look on her face...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Heres the thing.  I 
			really hadnt planned on 
			giving you your...uh... 
			anniversary gift until 
			tonight.
				(an uncomfortable 
				 smile)
			You know, anniversarys 
			good all day...

					KATE
			What are you talking 
			about?  You never wait 
			all day.  You can barely 
			wait until its light 
			out.

					JACK
			I know that, but...

		Beat.  Kate looks at him like shes looking into his 
		soul.

					KATE
			You forgot.

		Jack stands there, silent.

					KATE (CONTD)
			You actually forgot our 
			anniversary.

					JACK
			Ill fix it.  Ill go out 
			right now and get you 
			something.  Ill make it 
			right.

		That didnt help.

					KATE
				(holding back 
				 the tears)
			Jesus, Jack...Is this 
			where we are now?  Is 
			this our marriage?  
			Suddenly Im the wife who 
			has to drop hints two 
			weeks before her 
			anniversary so her 
			husband doesnt fuck it 
			up?

		Jack sees a tear run down her face...a pang of guilt on 
		his...

					JACK
			Please dont cry...

		Kate wipes the tear away but they just keep coming.

					KATE
				(shaking her head, 
				 crying)
			I dont want to be that, 
			Jack...

		Jack approaches her, holding out a hand but Kate pushes 
		it away, gets up and walks toward the bathroom...

		Jack is left standing alone, holding Kates gift...

		CUT TO:

    76	INT. FRONT PORCH - MINUTES LATER

		Jack emerges from the house, steps out onto the porch 
		for some air...

		He shakes his head, a mixture of frustration and self-
		pity on his face.

		He notices Annies bike leaning against the side of the 
		porch, and the bell that Cash gave him sitting on its 
		handle bar.

		He takes a step toward it, and gives the bell a gentle 
		RING ...he looks around, as if hes expecting someone 
		to appear ...but theres no one.  He RINGS the bell 
		again, louder this time, really trying to attract 
		someones attention.

					JACK
			Cmon...cmon...

		Nothing.  Finally, he lifts the bike up in the air, 
		RINGING the bell with everything hes got...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(shouting to the 
				 sky)
			Cmon, goddamnit, how was 
			I supposed to know the 
			date of their 
			anniversary!?  I never 
			married her!

		Pull back...Annie in the doorway...looking at him.

					ANNIE
				(slowly)
			Put the bicycle back on 
			the ground...

		Jack turns and sees her, gently lowering the bicycle.

    77	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

		Jack is mixing a glass of chocolate milk.  Annie, arms 
		folded, is waiting expectantly.  He finishes, sliding 
		the glass to her.

		She takes a long sip, puts the glass down, a chocolate 
		milk mustache on her lip.

					ANNIE
			Not bad...I shoulda 
			warned you.  Dad always 
			does something really 
			special for their 
			anniversary.

					JACK
			Like what?

					ANNIE
			One year he had a solar 
			system named after her...

					JACK
			Dont you think thats a 
			little gimmicky?

					ANNIE
			Mom liked it.

		Jack raises an eyebrow.

					JACK
			Maybe theres a jewelry 
			store back at the mall.  
			I could get her a pair of 
			earrings or something.

					ANNIE
			Thats good but...you did 
			forget the anniversary.

					JACK
			Right.  Thats a major 
			oversight...
				(thinking aloud)
			So if Im Kate...I cant 
			really afford the finer 
			things, my husbands 
			career is a crushing 
			disappointment to me, 
			Im trapped in suburbia...

		Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Did he ever take her to 
			the City?

		Annie smiles, impressed.

					ANNIE
			Youre really gettin the 
			hang of this.

		Suddenly, a look of confidence comes over Jacks face.  
		For the first time, he seems like a man in control.

    78	INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

		Annie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get 
		dressed.

		Kate, wearing a silky slip, walks out of her closet 
		carrying two dresses on hangers, a red one and a sexy 
		little black one.

		Kate holds out the two dresses to Annie.

					KATE
			Which do you think?

		Annie thinks about it for a moment, taking it very 
		seriously...

					ANNIE
			The black one...

		Kate nods.  Shes about to put it on when she looks at 
		Annie...

					KATE
			Fightings a part of it, 
			Annie.  You know that, 
			right?

					ANNIE
			Im not worried, Mom.  
			Hes still learning our 
			ways...

		Kate looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then nods.  
		Its true.  She puts down the dress and holds out a 
		hand to Annie.

					KATE
			Cmere.

		Kate leads her to the makeup table, then opens a 
		lipstick...

					ANNIE
				(excited)
			Really?

		Kate nods then applies some red lipstick to Annies 
		lips.

					KATE
			Now go like this...

		Kate rubs her lips together, showing Annie how to do 
		it.  Annie mimics her Mom, then Kate looks at her  
		Annies beaming.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Youre gonna break a lot 
			of hearts, you know.

		A smile from Annie...

		Pull back to reveal...Jack standing at the door, 
		watching ...appreciating the kind of mother Kate is...

    79   OMITTED

    80	EXT. LOIRE - NIGHT

		A small, elegant French restaurant hidden on a tree-
		lined lower Manhattan street.

    81	INT. LOIRE - SAME TIME

		Jack is wearing the suit Kate gave him.  Its not a 
		Zegna, but he looks pretty damn good.

		He leads Kate toward the cloak room at this intimate 
		restaurant...

		He helps her off with her coat.  Kates wearing the 
		sexy little black dress and we can immediately see its 
		effectiveness...

					JACK
			You look beautiful...

		A charmed smile from Kate as she hands Jack her coat.

		Jack hands the coats over to the COAT CHECK GIRL...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(instinctively)
			Thanks, Catherine...

		Jack fakes a SNEEZE, trying to cover up...Kate gives 
		him a pat on the back...

					KATE
			You okay?

		He takes Kate by the arm...

					JACK
			Fine...

		He leads her to the main room.

		She looks out at the room, elegant tables, French 
		country decor, a PIANIST playing Cole Porter...

					KATE
				(quietly to Jack)
			Jack...can we afford all 
			this?

					JACK
			Whats the difference?  
			Im taking my baby out 
			for our anniversary, damn 
			the costs...

					KATE
			How do you even know 
			about this place?

		Jacks caught for a moment.  Then...

					JACK
			Arnie...
				(insistent)
			Arnie.  Hell throw you a 
			curve ball once in a 
			while, thats for sure...

		Jack puts his arm around her and kisses her on the 
		cheek...

    82	INT. LOIRE - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack and Kate sit at a secluded table, a WAITER 
		standing next to them.  Jacks not even looking at the menu.

					JACK
			Well have the tureen of 
			quail breast with 
			shiitake mushrooms to 
			start, then the veal 
			medallions in raspberry 
			truffle sauce and the sea 
			scallops with pureed 
			artichoke hearts...sea 
			scallops, North of the 
			Caspian...

		Kate looks at Jack, a mixture of confusion and awe on 
		her face.

					WAITER
			Very good, sir.  And may 
			I say those are all 
			excellent selections.

					JACK
			You may...
				(perusing the 
				 wine list)
			Also, well have a bottle 
			of Lafite, 1982.

		Kate reaches over and pulls down the wine list, reading 
		it upside down.

					KATE
			Its five hundred and 
			fifty dollars, Jack!

		A wince from Jack...for a moment there it was almost 
		perfect.

					JACK
			Just a glass of red wine 
			for each of us...

		The waiter nods, then walks toward the kitchen...

					KATE
			You are so not off the 
			hook yet, slick.

					JACK
			But Im gettin close, right?

		A noncommittal nod from Kate.  Then Jack notices her 
		look over at the pianist, drawn in by the music.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You want to dance?

		A puzzled look from Kate.  Theres nobody else 
		dancing.  There isnt even much room to dance...

					KATE
			I dont think theres 
			dancing here, Jack.

		Jack gets up and holds out a hand.

					JACK
			Sure there is...

		Kate looks around again, then she smiles.

		Kate rises, taking his hand.  Jack takes her in his 
		arms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space, 
		confident and self-assured.

		The pianist looks up, smiling, appreciating their role 
		in this romantic moment.

		Kate moves with Jack, following his lead comfortably.  
		They look good together...in sync with each other...

		People are watching them...some of the men are 
		impressed, others are scoffing, but the women are 
		clearly charmed...

					KATE
				(whispering to 
				 Jack)
			Pretty good for a tire 
			salesman from Jersey...

		Jack flashes her his most charming smile.

					JACK
			I have my moments...

		They continue to dance, in a world of their own...

    83	INT. LOIRE - LATE

		Jack and Kate at the table enjoying a gourmet meal.  
		Jack holds out a fork with a piece of veal for Kate.  
		She takes a bite.

					KATE
			Mmmm...
				(spearing a scallop)
			...here, try one of 
			these...

		Jack takes a scallop from Kates fork.

					JACK
				(savoring the scallop) 
			God I missed that 
			taste...

		Kate laughs.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Why are you laughing?

		Kate shoots him a look of curiosity.  Jack looks back 
		at her, sees the trust in her face...He puts down his 
		fork.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I need to tell you 
			something.

					KATE
			Okay...

					JACK
			I think it may help us 
			but theres a slight 
			chance it could make 
			things worse.

		She hears the seriousness in his voice.

					KATE
			Now Im worried...just 
			say it.  Whatever it is 
			well deal with it.

					JACK
			Are you sure?

		She nods.  Jack searches his mind for the right words.  
		Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I feel like Im living 
			someone elses life...

		Jack looks to her, expecting the worst.  But she just 
		nods reassuringly.  He continues...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I used to be so sure 
			about everything, you 
			know?  I knew exactly who 
			I was and what I wanted.  
			Then one morning I woke 
			up and suddenly it was 
			all different...

					KATE
			Worse, you mean...

					JACK
			No.  Well, maybe a few 
			things.  But mostly just 
			different...

		Jack lets out a small smile.  Now hes the one whos 
		reassuring Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I never used to be like 
			this, Kate.  I had it all 
			figured out.  No doubts, 
			no regrets.

					KATE
			And now...?

					JACK
			Now...I dont...

		He looks at her, staring into her eyes, almost 
		desperate for understanding.

					KATE
			Me neither.

		A raised eyebrow from Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I think its good to be a 
			little unsure about who 
			you are.  Its very 
			human.

					JACK
			But you always seem so 
			certain.

					KATE
			Cmon, Jack, you think 
			there arent mornings 
			when I wake up and wonder 
			what the hell Im doing 
			in New Jersey...

					JACK
			Thats a big one for me, 
			too.

					KATE
			My office is a dump, I 
			answer my own phone...and 
			youve seen my pay check.

					JACK
			Your pay check is a 
			disgrace to pay checks.

					KATE
			I mean yes, I help people 
			that need it...

					JACK
			I guess...some of them 
			are probably faking.

					KATE
				(a laugh, then...)
			God, sometimes I think it 
			would be so nice not to 
			have to stretch ground 
			beef or maybe drive a car 
			with a CD player...

		He smiles, right there with her.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Imagine having a life 
			where everything was 
			easy...where you asked 
			for things and people 
			just brought them to 
			you...

					JACK
			Its wonderful...

		Kate laughs, nodding.

		A pause, then...

					KATE
			I think about it, too, 
			Jack.  I do.  I think 
			about the kind of person 
			Id be if I hadnt 
			married you...

		Its as if shes inside his head.  They stay like this 
		for a moment, looking into each other.

					JACK
			And...?

		She stops a moment, considering.  Then...

					KATE
			And I realize Ive just 
			erased the things in my 
			life Im most sure 
			about.  You, the kids...

		Jack nods.

					JACK
			Good things...

					KATE
			What are you sure about?

		Jack looks into Kates eyes.

					JACK
			Im sure that right now 
			theres nowhere Id 
			rather be than here with 
			you...

		Kate smiles at Jack, a loving, secure smile.  Its been 
		a while.

		CUT TO:

    84	EXT. PENSION - NIGHT

		The mini-van parked outside a small brownstone right on 
		the square.  Its like something out of a Henry James 
		novel... charming, meticulously maintained, elegant...

    85	INT. PENSION, SUITE - A LITTLE LATER

		The door opens and Jack, carrying Kate in his arms, 
		enters...

		Jack puts Kate down and she takes in the room, antique 
		furniture...its like walking into another world...

					KATE
			This is so beautiful...

		Jack smiles as he opens a champagne bottle sitting on a 
		silver ice bucket...

					KATE (CONTD)
			You know champagne makes 
			me do crazy things.

					JACK
				(pouring)
			Ill just full yours up 
			to the top.
				(handing her a 
				 glass)
			Happy anniversary, 
			sweetheart.

		Kate smiles, clinking her glass with Jacks.

					KATE
			I dont know how you did 
			it, hoss, but you pulled 
			it off.

					JACK
			Im out of the doghouse?

					KATE
			Way out...

		Kate saunters into the bedroom, looking at the king-
		size poster bed, feeling the down quilt.  Jack follows 
		her...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(turning to him)
			You may even get lucky 
			tonight...

		Kate kisses him...when their lips separate, we can see 
		the powerful effect it has on him.

		Jack looks deep into her eyes, stroking her hair, lost 
		in her.

					JACK
			Youre so...beautiful...

					KATE
			I already told you you 
			were gonna get lucky, 
			Jack...

		They kiss again, a long soulful kiss.  Then...

		Jack pulls back, a look of realization on his face...

					JACK
			My god, all this time...I 
			never stopped loving 
			you...

					KATE
				(a wide smile)

		She kisses him, their bodies intertwined...hands 
		caressing ...more and more passionate...then reaches 
		behind her to the light.  The room goes dark...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    86	INT. PENSION, SUITE - MORNING

		Morning sun streams onto Jack and Kate in bed...

		Kate, in Jacks arms, her head on his chest, a 
		contented smile on her face...

		Jacks eyes open...adjust to the light.  He looks over 
		at Kate.

		Theres something different in his eyes...something 
		deeper.  Jack smiles...a broad, Im in love kind of 
		smile.

		Kate stirs, gently stroking Jacks chest.

					KATE
			Mmmm...Jack...

		Kate lifts her head, turning to face Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I feel like I should give 
			you money...

		Jack laughs.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I mean, my god, Jack you 
			were always good but 
			this...this was... like a 
			porno movie.

		Kate lays her head back on Jacks chest, looking at 
		Washington Square through the window.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I could stay here 
			forever...

					JACK
			I dont think Id fight 
			you on that one...

		Kate lifts her head and looks at him expectantly.  They 
		kiss.

    87	EXT. NEW JERSEY STREET - NIGHT

		The mini-van passes a sign that reads, Welcome to 
		Teaneck.

    88	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, VARIOUS - MORNING

		Annie walking through the downstairs of the house, 
		practicing her violin...its a noise bordering on 
		MUSIC, but not quite...

		She walks into the kitchen where...

		Jack stands at the counter in his robe, reading the 
		Newark Star Ledger and drinking a cup of coffee.

		He lowers the paper, watches Annie with a smile as she 
		strolls through the room playing her violin badly...he 
		goes back to his paper.

    89	INT. JACKS CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack, still singing, donning his Dockers and short-
		sleeve oxford...

   89A	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

		The front door of the Campbell House...

		Jack emerges in his work clothes, putting his coat on, 
		a bagel in his mouth...

		He disappears from frame, the screen door closing 
		slowly behind him...

		In a moment...Kate appears at the door, a cup of coffee 
		in her hand...she follows Jack with her eyes as he 
		heads to the car.

		Then...a smile from Kate...

		In a moment...Jack returns to frame and heads straight 
		into Kates arms...

		...a passionate kiss as she leans against the door 
		post...

					KATE
			Have a good day...

		A smile from Jack as she pats him on the ass and sends 
		him on his way...

    90	EXT. BIG EDS - AFTERNOON

		Jack, pointing to a stack of radials, is standing with 
		a MAN (40s) wearing a pale blue leisure suit and a pair 
		of high top Nike Air Jordans.

					JACK
			For the money, theyre 
			hands down the best 
			radial we carry...

					MAN
				(thinking, then...)
			Okay, Ill take them...

					JACK
			You wont regret it...
				(shouting to Tommy)
			Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up 
			with four B.F. Goodrich 
			G-Force T/As...
				(looking the man 
				 over)
			...and give him ten 
			percent off for having 
			the best costume...

		Just then, a black ROLLS ROYCE SILVER SERAPH pulls into 
		the lot, its front left tire riding on the rim...

					ESTELLE (O.S.)
				(over P.A. system)
			Jack, Kate on line two!  
			Jack pick up two!

		Jack turns toward the door, but then looks curiously 
		back at the Rolls...something familiar about it...

		Then...Peter Lassiter gets out of the car...

					KENNY
				(walking out to Jack)
			Kates on two, Jack.
				(on seeing the Rolls)
			Nice ride...

					JACK
				(staring at Lassiter)
			If youre into that kind 
			of conspicuous 
			consumption...

					KENNY
			You want me to handle 
			him?  I think Im 
			ready...

					ESTELLE (O.S.)
				(over P.A. system)
			Jack!  Kate still holding 
			on line two...

					JACK
			Sure...be careful, he 
			looks like a tough 
			negotiator...

		Jack walks inside...

    91	INT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		...but hes still focused on Lassiter through the 
		window, cant take his eyes off him...

		He gets to the phone...sees the light for line two 
		blinking ...he looks back outside, sees Kenny approach 
		Lassiter...

		...back to the blinking phone light...he picks up the 
		phone...

		But cant bring himself to hit the blinking light.  
		Then...

					JACK
				(to Estelle, into 
				 intercom)
			Tell Kate Ill call her 
			back...

		INTERCUT WITH ESTELLE IN HER OFFICE

					ESTELLE 
				(into intercom)
			It sounded pretty 
			important.

					JACK
				(into intercom)
			Im with a customer.  
			Ill call her back.

		He takes his hand away from the phone and walks back 
		outside the store...

		CHAPTER THIRTEEN - PETER LASSITER

    92	EXT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		...towards Kenny and Lassiter.

					LASSITER
				(to Kenny)
			I seem to have had some 
			kind of blow out...

		Jack approaches, tapping Kenny on the shoulder.

					JACK
			Why dont you let me take 
			this one, Kenny?

					KENNY
			Okay, chief.

		Kenny nods then heads back inside...

					JACK
			Peter Lassiter...

					LASSITER
				(surprised)
			Do I know you?

					JACK
			Not exactly. Ive seen you 
			on CNBC.
				(with a smile)
			You look taller in real 
			life...

		CUT TO:

    93	INT. BIG EDS TIRED, JACKS OFFICE - LATE

		Jack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his 
		cluttered, cramped office.

					JACK
			...truth is, Mintz was so 
			busy timing his wifes 
			breathing he didnt see 
			that MedTech needed 
			Global more than the 
			other way around.  Ten 
			days, two weeks tops, 
			they wouldve approached 
			you with an offer, and 
			Id bet anything it 
			wouldve been thirty 
			billion, not twenty 
			nine...
				(a knowing smile)
			Problem was, Peter, you 
			had a pussycat running 
			the show. What you needed 
			was a rottweiler.

		Lassiter, sitting on the little chair across from Jack, 
		an intrigued look on his face...

					LASSITER
				(nodding)
			Well, Im impressed.

		A smile from Jack.

					LASSITER (CONTD)
			I really am...

		Jack savors the moment, until...

					LASSITER (CONTD)
			So, about my car...

		Hes jarred back to reality, a little crestfallen...

					JACK
			Sure. Were going to 
			have to special order 
			that tire. Itll be 
			ready in about two days.

		Lassiter nods, then takes a business card out of his 
		wallet.

					LASSITER
			This has my office address 
			on it...
				(thinking, then...)
			Why dont you drop it off 
			yourself?

		A smile from Jack.

		CUT TO:

    94	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JACKS BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Kate, sound asleep in bed...

		Pan across to Jack, his eyes wide open, lost in 
		thought...

    95	INT. BIG EDS, JACKS OFFICE - DAY

		Jack wearing his Zeena suit, sitting behind his desk, 
		distracted, as he listens to HECTOR, 40s, the 
		GUATEMALEN MECHANIC.

					HECTOR
			...I say to her, Margarita, 
			we already have four kids, 
			why do we need more?

		Jack is shaking his leg anxiously under the desk as he 
		eyes the door...
					
					HECTOR (CONTD)
			But she say she want an 
			even number. I say four 
			is an even number! But 
			she say she want six.

		Jack checks his watch...

					HECTOR (CONTD)
			I tell her, Margarita, I 
			just got my green card, 
			I like to sit back and 
			rest a little bit...

					JACK
				(interrupting)
			Hector...do I usually 
			listen to your personal 
			problems?

					HECTOR 
			Sure, Jack, all the time...

		Jack nods, then...

					JACK
			Look, I have some business 
			that I have to take care 
			of in the city so Im 
			leaving early...
				(getting up)
			My advice to you...follow 
			your dreams.

		CUT TO:

    96	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - AFTERNOON

		Jack pulling up to the building in Lassiters Rolls...

		He gets out of the car, walks to the building, feeling 
		good, confident, stopping to gaze up at the 
		skyscraper...he breathes in deeply, then heads 
		inside...

    96A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

		Jack enters, instinctively tossing the car keys to the 
		SECURITY GUARD...the guard looks at him like hes 
		crazy...

    97	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Lassiter walk together...

					LASSITER
			...were really more of a 
			boutique operation, as 
			you can see...

					JACK
			But youre not interested 
			in boutique dollars...
				(a smile)
			I get it...

		They walk into...

    98	INT. ALAN MINTZS OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Past the assistants desk...

					MINTZS ASSISTANT
				(seeing Lassiter)
			Hes expecting you, Mr. 
			Lassiter...

		Lassiter doesnt even slow down...

    99	INT. ALAN MINTZS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Its Jacks old office but you wouldnt know it from 
		the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a 
		play pen where the bar used to be.  Jack enters, 
		immediately struck by the difference...

					LASSITER
				(to Mintz)
			Alan, this is Jack 
			Campbell...the one I was 
			telling you about...

		Mintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the 
		desk and goes to shake Jacks hand.

					ALAN
			Jack, of course.

		They shake hands.

					JACK
				(appropriately 
				 deferential)
			Mr. Mintz.

					ALAN
			Please, call me Alan. We 
			try to cultivate a casual 
			atmosphere around here...

					JACK
				(re: play pen)
			I can see that, Alan.

		A chuckle from Mintz.

					ALAN
			You have kids, Jack?

					JACK
				(hesitating, then...)
			Uh...actually, yes. Two...
			good ones.

		Another laugh from Mintz.

					ALAN
			Thats great...
				(gesturing to 
				 the sofa)
			Why dont you have a seat?

		Jack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and 
		Lassiter take the chairs.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			So, Peter mentioned that 
			you were an avid CNBC 
			watcher but didnt say 
			whether you had any 
			actual Wall Street 
			experience?

		Jacks a little taken aback by the question, not 
		realizing he was walking into an interview...

		He crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable.

					JACK
			I was a sales associate, 
			at E.F. Hutton.

					ALAN
			A broker? Really. And now 
			youre in the tire 
			business?

					JACK
			Thats right. And auto 
			supply...

					ALAN
			Uh huh. The retail end, I 
			understand.

		Jack nods...

					JACK
			Uh...we actually get about 
			sixty percent of our 
			business from automotive 
			service.

					ALAN
			Mind if I ask what kind of 
			sales you did last year? 
			Ballpark...

					JACK
			We did one point seven 
			million in total revenue...

					ALAN
			Uh huh...one point seven.  
			And what do you project for 
			this year?

		Jack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing 
		questions, the smirk on Mintzs face...


					ALAN (CONTD)
			Any thoughts at all on 
			that?

		As Jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent 
		of his handicap...

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Jack?

		He stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter 
		then ...a confident smile.

					JACK
			Well, Alan, I think were 
			gonna have a banner year.  
			Sales are up almost 
			twenty percent in the 
			first quarter and we just 
			landed a major trucking 
			company account.

					ALAN
			Really. So youre 
			projecting what, a tad 
			over two million?

		A gleam in Jacks eye.

					JACK
			Thats right. And that 
			would make us number one 
			in our market...
				(getting up)
			You mind if I stand?

		A raised eyebrow from Mintz.

		Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he 
		crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of 
		water...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Look, I know our paltry 
			little two million in 
			sales is about what you 
			spend on office supplies 
			in a year.  And I know 
			some regional trucking 
			company account is 
			nothing compared to a 
			sixty billion dollar 
			merger...

					ALAN
			Im not trying to knock 
			the tire business, Jack.

					JACK
				(a confident chuckle)
			Its okay, Alan. I get it. 
			Im in your shoes, Im 
			thinking exactly the same 
			thing...but heres the 
			thing. Business is 
			business.  Wall Street, 
			Main Street, its all 
			just a bunch of people 
			getting up in the morning, 
			trying to figure out how 
			the hell theyre gonna 
			send their kids to 
			college.  Its just 
			people...

		Jacks confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter 
		appears intrigued...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And I know people.

					ALAN
			Im sure you do...

					LASSITER
				(intervening)
			Lets let the man have 
			his say...

		Mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile...

					JACK
				(to Mintz)
			Take you, for instance...

					ALAN
				(defensive)
			What about me?

					JACK
			You drink about sixteen 
			Diet Cokes a day. Youre 
			an excellent father, but 
			you feel guilty about the 
			time you spend away from 
			home. You drink bourbon, 
			but you offer your 
			clients scotch...

		Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And your wife decorated 
			this office...

		A laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a 
		caught look on his face.

					LASSITER
			He certainly has your 
			number, Alan.

					JACK
				(turning to Lassiter)
			Youre a little tougher, 
			Peter.

		A raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but hes game...

					JACK (CONTD)
			For one thing, you like 
			expensive things.

					LASSITER
				(smiling proudly) 
			Thats easy. Youve seen 
			my car.

					JACK
				(a chuckle)
			Okay...you smoke Hoyo de 
			Monterreys. Youre a 
			scotch man, single malt, 
			not because its trendy 
			but because youve been 
			doing it for forty years, 
			and you stay with what 
			works. You have two great 
			loves in your life, your 
			horses and this company.  
			You wept openly the day 
			the Dow hit ten thousand...

		Lassiters impressed.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And youre a man who 
			prides himself on finding 
			talent in unusual 
			places...


					LASSITER
			Oh? And how would you 
						know that?

		Jack smiles.

					JACK
			Because Im here.

		On Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on 
		smile.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Im prepared to do 
			anything it takes to get 
			this job. Start anywhere 
			you need me to start.  
			Ill park cars if I 
			to...
				(into Lassiters 
				 eyes)
			The biggest part of 
			judging character is 
			knowing yourself. And I 
			know this, I can do this 
			job. Give me a chance, 
			Peter, I wont let you 
			down.

		Lassiter returns Jacks gaze with equal intensity. In a 
		moment, he turns to Mintz.

					LASSITER
				(to Mintz)
			Alan, why dont you show 
			Jack around a bit...

					ALAN
			Id love to.

		CUT TO:

    100	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Alan walking side by side down the hallway... 
		EMPLOYEES passing them by, greeting Mintz, Mintz waving 
		back...

					ALAN
				(pointing)
			...thats our war room.  
			We did seven major deals 
			last year, three of them 
			hostile.

					JACK
				(not particularly 
				 impressed)
			Seven.  Really.

		They turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of 
		the corridor.

		Mintz stops, turning to Jack.  Jack returns Mintzs 
		gaze with a quizzical look.

					ALAN
			Lets cut the shit, huh 
			Campbell? What, did you go 
			through his wallet or 
			something?

		Jacks a little taken aback.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			No matter. That circus 
			act back there may have 
			dazzled Lassiter 
			momentarily but it 
			doesnt do shit forme.  
			Even if you get this job, 
			which I highly doubt, let 
			me warn you, Lassiter 
			loses interest in his pet 
			projects very quickly. 
			Im in the big office 
			because Ive proved 
			myself to him year after 
			year and nobody is going 
			to come in here and start 
			turning the old mans 
			head. Especially not some 
			tire salesman from New 
			Jersey. So you watch 
			yourself and stay away 
			from Lassiter, and maybe, 
			just maybe, Ill keep you 
			on after he gets tired of 
			you. Do we understand 
			each other?

		Jack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent, 
		expressionless.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Do we?!

		Then, a broad smile from Jack.

					JACK
			God, you really are 
			different, arent you...
				(nodding)
			I mean...wow...I am 
			impressed.

		Now its Mintzs turn to look quizzical.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Good for you. Why shouldnt 
			you protect whats yours.

					ALAN
			I dont think youre hearing 
			me.

					JACK
			Oh, Im hearing you, Alan.  
			Thats not the problem.  
			The problem is that what 
			you think is yours, is 
			really mine.  And I dont 
			care how low on the totem 
			pole I start, I will get 
			it back...
				(poking him in 
				 the chest)
			So do yourself a favor and 
			dont get too attached to 
			that view because sometime 
			soon, maybe very soon, you
			and your French country 
			antiques, your chintz sofa, 
			and your little play pen 
			are gonna be moving out of 
			that office.

		Jack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Oh, and by the way, you 
			try selling tires for a 
			living.  I promise you, 
			youd starve.

		Jack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune, 
		leaving Mintz standing there, bewildered.

		CHAPTER FOURTEEN - A PERFECT LIFE?

		CUT TO:

    101	INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - DAY

		A double door opens and Jack leads Kate into this huge 
		duplex.  Kate looks around, taking the place in.

					JACK
			Welcome to Xanadu...

		The place is incredible...marble floors, architectural 
		lines, high tech fixtures, elegant modern furniture...
		its striking but not at all homey like the Jersey 
		house.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Pretty incredible, isnt 
			it?

					KATE
			Its like a museum.

		Jack nods.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(turning to Jack)
			So whats the big 
			surprise? You didnt 
			rent this place for 
			the weekend, did you?

					JACK
			Think bigger.

					KATE
			For the week?

		Jack chuckles.

					JACK
			This place is a perk, 
			Kate.

					KATE
			A perk for what?

					JACK
			A company called P.K. 
			Lassiter and Associates 
			Investment House uses it 
			to attract new 
			executives...

		Kates confused.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Youre talking to their 
			new Vice President of 
			Mergers and Acquisitions.

					KATE
			What are you talking 
			about, Jack?


					JACK
			Im going into arbitrage, 
			honey.  Turns out I have 
			a knack for it.  Ill be 
			making two hundred grand 
			a year plus a hefty bonus
			and thats just to 
			start.  And, we can live 
			in this apartment 
			practically rent free for 
			as long as we want.

		Jack measures her reaction. Its not good...

					JACK (CONTD)
			We can finally afford to 
			move back into the city.  
			In style.

		Kate just looks at him, in shock. Then...

					KATE
			Are you out of your mind?

					JACK
			I dont think so. This 
			is going to be a better 
			life for all of us, 
			honey.  Well put Annie 
			and Josh in private 
			schools...

					KATE
			Annie goes to a great 
			school.

					JACK
			Im talking about the 
			best schools in the 
			country here, Kate...

					KATE
			Jack, what could you 
			possibly be thinking?  
			What about my job?

					JACK
			This is New York City, 
			its like the needy 
			people capital of the 
			world.  Those Jersey 
			clients of yours arent a 
			tenth as pathetic as the 
			ones you could get 
			here...

					KATE
				(cutting him off)
			I cant believe you want 
			to move back into the 
			city.  I thought the 
			reason we left was 
			because we didnt want to 
			raise the kids here?

					JACK
			No, this is the center of 
			the universe.  If I were 
			living in Roman times, I 
			would live in Rome, where 
			else?  Today, America is 
			the Roman Empire and New 
			York is Rome itself. 
			John Lennon.

					KATE
				(cutting him off) 
			Jack.

		Jacks starting to struggle...

					JACK
			Look, Im detecting a 
			kind of funky tension 
			here...We dont have to 
			live in this apartment. 
			I dont need this...Ill 
			commute...Ill drive to 
			work...

		Jacks back on his heels...seeing his dream picked 
		apart...

					KATE
			In traffic?  Its over an 
			hour each way?  Thats 
			almost three hours a 
			day.  When are you going 
			to see the kids?

		Hes frustrated...he pauses a moment to gather 
		himself. Then...

					JACK
			Kate. Youre not 
			understanding me. Im 
			talking about a great 
			life.  A perfect life.  
			Everything we pictured 
			when we were young. The 
			whole package. You said 
			it yourself, life has 
			thrown us surprises, and 
			so we made sacrifices.  
			But now I can finally get 
			us back on track...

		A sad chuckle from Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I can do that.  I want to 
			do that.  For all of us.  
			I need to do that as a 
			man...
				(imploring her)
			Think about it.  No more 
			lousy restaurants, no 
			more clipping coupons, no 
			more shoveling snow...

					KATE
			Then get a goddamn snow 
			blower!

		Jacks taken aback by the intensity of her tone.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Dont get a new career 
			without even telling me.  
			Dont take Annie out of a 
			school she loves.  Dont 
			move us out of a house 
			weve become a family 
			in...

		Kate stands there, wounded...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(quietly)
			Dont do that...

					JACK
			Look, youre making this 
			into something its not. 
			This isnt a referendum 
			on our lives, Kate. Its 
			a step forward...
				(appealing to her)
			Dont you see?  Im 
			talking about us finally 
			having a life other 
			people envy.

		Silence.  Kate looks him in the eye  a deep, piercing 
		look...

					KATE
			They already do envy us, 
			Jack...

		Kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.

    103	INT. ANNIES ROOM - NIGHT

		Annie is in a nightgown, practicing her violin. Jack 
		walks in.

		Its all he can do to hold back cringing at the missed 
		notes. Annie finishes the piece, lowering the bow.

					JACK
			Very nice. What is it?

					ANNIE
			Mary Had A Little Lamb.

					JACK
			Ah. A classic...

		Annie starts PLAYING again as Jack looks at the 
		dresser. She has 20 or so family photos lined up and 
		down its sides...

		Jack studies them...in every one Jacks face is totally 
		contented.  Jack studies them, looking at his own face.

		Annie lowers the bow, watching him...

		Jack turns to her.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Please dont stop...

		She smiles, then starts PLAYING again.  He turns back 
		to the pictures...

    104	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - LATE

		Jack...standing in front of the desk, nursing a drink.

		He looks at Lassiters business card, sitting on the 
		surface of the desk...

		He gazes around the room...his eyes coming to rest on a 
		bookshelf...a book...

		He moves toward it...looking at its spine...its a 
		tattered copy of Vonneguts Cats Cradle.  He pulls 
		it off the shelf, theres something inside...a 
		bookmark...

		...a PAN AM ticket jacket sleeve...

		...inside...a boarding pass...From: London/Heathrow, 
		To: New York/JFK, 10/4/87.

		He looks at it...somethings not right...

					JACK
			From London to New York...?
				(looking up)
			I came back...

		Then...a NOISE...

		Jack turns and sees Kate walking into the doorway, 
		standing there...She sees Jack holding the Pan Am 
		ticket sleeve.

					KATE
			Our finest moment, 
			right...

		A quizzical look from Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			When you got on that 
			plane I was sure it was 
			over.  I left the airport 
			afraid Id never see you 
			again.  And then you 
			showed up the very next 
			day...
				(a wistful smile)
			That was a good 
			surprise...

		She continues into the room, leaning against a 
		bookshelf.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I think about you on that 
			plane, about what must 
			have been going through 
			your mind...you sitting 
			there imagining our life 
			together, our life 
			apart...I think about the 
			decision you made...

		Jack watches her as she lets out a small sigh.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Maybe I was being naive 
			but I believed wed grow 
			old together in this 
			house.  That wed spend 
			holidays here, have g
			randchildren visit us 
			here.  I had this image 
			of us all grey and 
			wrinkly, me working in 
			the garden, you 
			repainting the deck...

		Kate smiles gently as she pictures this.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Things change, right?  
			People change...
				(pausing)
			If you need this, Jack, I 
			mean really need this, I 
			will take these children 
			from a life they love, 
			and take myself from the 
			only home weve ever 
			shared, and move wherever 
			you need to go.  Ill do 
			that because I love 
			you...

		The words are like a warm embrace for Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I love you, Jack. And  
			thats more important to 
			me than our address...

		Kate smiles lovingly at Jack...she walks over to him, 
		kisses him gently on the forehead.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I choose us.

		She turns and heads out of the room, leaving him there, 
		the boarding pass still in hand, staring lovingly at 
		her as she goes...

    105	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks into the room...

		The lights are off, Kate already in bed sleeping.

		He undresses for bed, unable to take his eyes off Kate.

		Finally, he lifts the covers and climbs into bed next 
		to her, moving closer to her, putting an arm around 
		her, drawing her in...

		In her sleep, Kate nestles in Jacks embrace.  He 
		savors the feeling, then closes his eyes as...

		They lay there...side by side...together...a single 
		person.

		DISSOLVE TO:

    106	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

		The morning light streams into the room.  Kate opens 
		her eyes.  Jacks not in bed.  A look of curiosity.

		Then, she hears LAUGHTER from outside.

		She goes over to the window...opens the blinds... 
		revealing...

		Jack in the backyard, LAUGHING with joy, playing in the 
		snow with Annie and Josh.

		Kate watches...a satisfied smile sweeping across her 
		face...

    107	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BACKYARD - SAME TIME

		...Jack reaches out and snags Annie...she CACKLES in 
		delight...

		The three of them fall over onto the soft white snow...

		The laughter from the kids is uncontrollable, Jacks 
		joy is just as palpable...

		Finally, Annie stops laughing and grabs Jack around the 
		neck, hugging his tight.

					ANNIE
				(whispering in 
				 Jacks ear)
			I knew youd come back...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    108	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

		Jack walks over to a utility shelf, fishing around 
		until he finds a bag of rock salt...he grabs it, sees 
		its empty...

		And then he hears it...the sound of a BICYCLE BELL 
		RINGING, echoing through the room.

		A shudder passes through his body...

		He turns and sees Annie at the open garage door, 
		sitting on her bike, ringing the BELL.

		Its an eerie moment for Jack...

					JACK
			What are you doing?

					ANNIE
				(a curious look)
			Ringing my bell...

		On Jacks anxious face...

		CHAPTER FIFTEEN  SAYING GOODBYE

    110	INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

		On Jack...crouched down in an aisle of this local 
		convenience store...checking out the bags of rock 
		salt...

		He looks at the price tag on one of the bags...

					JACK
			Four ninety nine?! Its just 
			salt for gods sake...

		On the entrance to the store...the door opens, a YOUNG 
		GIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager...

		She glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package 
		of gum...

		From the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach 
		the counter...

		On Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of 
		salt from the shelf, when...

					CASH (O.S.)
			Thatll be sixty five cents, 
			little angel...

		Jack registers the voice...he rises slowly, looking 
		over to the front counter...where he sees...

		Cash, dressed in a typical chain convenience store 
		uniform, ringing up the teenager...

		An excited smile from Jack at the sight of Cash...

					JACK
			You...!

		Then...the color drains from Jacks face...

					JACK (CONTD)
			What are you doing here...

		Jack moves toward Cash at the counter...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Youre not sending me 
			back...

		The girl eyes Jack curiously, then removes a dollar 
		bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter 
		to Cash...

					CASH
			Jack, its good to see 
			you...

		Cash reaches into the register, taking out change for 
		ten dollars...he hands the girl $9.35...

					CASH (CONTD)
				(to the girl)
			Thank you darlin...

		The girl looks at the money, realizing that Cash has 
		given her the wrong change...

					CASH (CONTD)
				(back to Jack, 
				 seeing the
				 rock salt)
			What do you got there, 
			rock salt?  Look at you, 
			all domestic and shit...
			You really figured some 
			things out, huh?

		The girl looks at Cash talking to Jack...

					JACK
			Im not going back...

		The girl hesitates...Cash turns to her...

					CASH 
				(to the girl)
			Everything okay...?

		She looks at him, a moment of decision, then...

					TEENAGE GIRL
			Yeah...fine.

					JACK
				(raising his voice)
			Hey! Did you hear me...?!

		Cash ignores Jack, watching the girl as she heads to 
		the door, hesitates a moment, then walks out...

		A look of disappointment on Cashs face as he reaches 
		into his pocket, pulling out a little notebook...

		Cash looks at Jack.

					CASH 
				(making a note 
				 in his book)

			That was a character issue...
				(shaking his head)
			...and for nine dollars?  
			Thats just sad...

					JACK
			Hey, Im talking to you!  
			I am not going back, do you 
			understand...?!

		Cash looks at him, compassion on his face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You cant do this. You 
			cant keep coming in and 
			out of peoples lives, 
			messing things up...

					CASH
			Cmon, Jack...

		Jack throws six bucks on the counter...

					JACK
			Ive got kids, Im going 
			home...

					CASH
			You know what the word 
			glimpse means, J? Its 
			by nature an impermanent 
			thing.

		Jack walks determinedly toward the exit. He stops and 
		turns at the door...

					JACK
				(pointing at 
				 Cash)
			Im staying.

		Cash follows him with his eyes, a proud look on Cashs 
		face as Jack leaves...

    111	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JOSHS ROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks to Josh.  Hes sleeping soundly.

		Jack gently kisses Josh on the head, careful not to 
		wake him.

    112	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, ANNIES ROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack is standing over Annie, kissing her on the cheek.

					ANNIE
				(stirring, groggy)
			Is it morning yet?

					JACK
			No, honey. Go back to 
			sleep.

		She closes her eyes as Jack stands there for a moment 
		looking at her, sadness all over his face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Take care of yourself,
			Annie.  Im going back to 
			the mother ship...

		Finally, he turns to go...

    113	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		The clock reads, 11:17.  Kate is already in bed as 
		Jack walks in.

					KATE
				(looking up from 
				 her book)
			Hey...

		Jack approaches her, sitting on the bed...

					JACK
			These last weeks, Kate, I 
			know that Ive done 
			some...some unusual 
			things.

		Kate nods.

					KATE
			Its been interesting, 
			thats for sure.

					JACK
			But Ive done some good 
			things too, havent I?

					KATE
			Youve been Jack 
			Campbell.  And thats 
			always a good thing...

		She kisses him on the cheek.

		He takes her arms in his hands and looks her in the 
		eyes.

					JACK
			I need you to remember 
			me, Kate.  How I am right 
			now, right this very 
			moment.  I need you to 
			put that image in your 
			heart and keep it with 
			you, no matter what 
			happens.

					KATE
			Are you okay, Jack?

					JACK
			Please, just promise me 
			youll do that. You have 
			to promise, Kate. 
			Because if you dont, 
			then its like it never 
			happened and I dont 
			think I could live with 
			that.

		Shes a bit confused but she couldnt be more in love 
		with him.

					KATE
			I promise, Jack...

					JACK
			Promise me again...

					KATE
			I promise. Come to bed, 
			honey.

		Jack stands up, heading toward the door.

					JACK
			Soon...

    114	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

		Snow begins to fall...

		Jack with Lucy on a leash, walking side by side, his 
		mind elsewhere...

		Lucy leads him around a corner...to a large open 
		field...

		Lucy stops.  She looks back at Jack, then out to the 
		open field.

		Jack removes the leash. The dog bounds happily out 
		into the field, looking for just the right spot.

		Jack puts his hands in his coat pocket...pulls out a 
		half-eaten roll of PEPPERMINT LIFESAVERS, puts one in 
		his mouth...

		He looks up at the sky, snow gently falling onto his 
		face. Its cold, but its beautiful...peaceful and 
		still...the air clean and crisp...

		He breathes in the fresh air, the Lifesaver dissolving 
		in his mouth, watching the dog...

    115	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		The room is dark...

		Jack enters, sees Kate sleeping soundly in bed.

		He sits down in a chair and watches Kate asleep, a sad 
		look in his eyes...

		As he continues to watch her, to listen to her, his own 
		eyelids appear to grow heavy...

		He tries to fight the sleep...opening his eyes...
		focusing on her...but its no use...

		Finally, he closes his eyes...falling into a deep 
		sleep...

		CHAPTER SIXTEEN  THE OLD LIFE

		DISSOLVE TO:

    116	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING

		A PHONE RINGING

		Jack, flat on his back in bed...Light streams onto 
		his face ...he stirs...

		THE PHONE STILL RINGING...

		Jack reaches over to Kates side...theres no one 
		there.

		Pull back to reveal...his old Manhattan apartment... 
		his old dressy clothes strewn on the floor...

		Jack, sleep still in his eyes, reaches over...hes not 
		wearing any pajamas...picks up the phone...

					JACK
				(groggy, dazed)
			Yeah...okay, send her 
			up...

		He drops the phone...turns back over...lets his eyes 
		stay closed for another moment...then...

		His eyes open...

		He looks around...sees his shirtless torso...then his 
		old apartment...tailored clothes on the floor.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(sadly)
			Damnit.

		Jack looks at the clock, 9:23 a.m.  He gets out of 
		bed, throwing on pants and a pair of shoes, and leaves 
		the room...

    117	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack walks to the door just as...

		The doorbell RINGS.  He stops, then cautiously opens 
		the door, seeing...

		PAULA, wearing a long overcoat and a wide smile on her 
		face.

					PAULA
			Waiting for me by the door, 
			huh?

		Jack looks at her.

					JACK
			Paula...

		Paula opens her coat  the only thing she has on 
		underneath is a sexy little teddy.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(momentarily 
				  distracted)
			Thats totally see through...

					PAULA
				(smiling)
			Merry Christmas...

					JACK
				(confused)
			Christmas?  It cant be 
			Christmas...

		Jack stares at her, totally confused...

					PAULA
				(lasciviously)
			Its whatever you want it 
			to be, Jack...

		Jack grabs a leather jacket then walks right by a 
		shocked Paula and heads out the door, practically 
		running down the corridor.

					PAULA (CONTD)			
			Jack?...Jack!

		CUT TO:

    118	EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari speeds down the bridge, toward Jersey...

    119	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari pulls up in the driveway and he hops 
		out. He races to the front door, POUNDING on it...

		A MAN in a Van Heusen shirt and Hagar slacks answers.  
		Jack stares at him in shock.

					MAN
			Can I help you?

					JACK
			Is Kate here? Does Kate live 
			here?!

					MAN
			Kate? No, theres no one here 
			named Kate.  Is that good 
			enough for you?

		Jack starts rapping his head against the door post, 
		much to the shock of the guy standing there.

					JACK
			Damn...damn...damn...

					MAN
			Hey, are you okay?

					JACK
			No...Im not...

					MAN
			Is there anything I can do 
			for you?

		Jack shakes his head mournfully.

					MAN (CONTD)
			Hey, my wifes in the kitchen.  
			You got a cigarette?

					JACK
			Im sorry, no...

		Jack walks off, beleaguered...

    120	EXT. ARNIES HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

		Jacks car drives by as Arnie carries a bicycle box out
		to the garbage.  The car screeches to a halt in front 
		of the driveway.

					ARNIE
				(shouting at Jack)
			Hey, you cant park that 
			thing here.

					JACK
				(out the window)
			Its me, Jack...

					ARNIE
			I dont care if youre Tim 
			Allen with your fancy car 
			and all your tools, you 
			still cant park here.

					JACK
			Tell me you recognize me, 
			Arnie.  Please...

					ARNIE
			Howd you know my name?

					JACK
			We bowl together. Were 
			bowlers ...we won a 
			championship...were winners.

					ARNIE
			I never won anything in 
			bowling.

		Arnie peers at Jack through the window.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Wait a second...
				(thinking)
			Jack...Jack...

					JACK
			Yes...Jack Campbell...

					ARNIE
			Of course. Jack Campbell. I 
			went to high school with
			you...you played baseball, 
			right?
				(at the Ferrari)
			Youre doing well...

					JACK
				(remembering)
			Yes, thats it...yes, we 
			went to high school together.

					ARNIE
			You never really talked to 
			me.  I wanted to talk to 
			you, man...

					JACK
			Yeah...I guess I just 
			wanted you to know, we 
			couldve been really good 
			friends...

    120A	INT. FERRARI - DAY

		Jack driving...a CELL PHONE RINGS.

		A curious look on Jacks face, its been a while since 
		hes heard that sound.

					JACK
				(answering phone) 
			Hello?

					ADELLE (O.S.)
			Hey Santa, where are you?  
			Everybodys here.

					JACK
			Adelle?

					ADELLE (O.S.)
			You were supposed to be here 
			half an hour ago...the 
			emergency strategy session?  
			Your trip to Aspen? Theyre 
			all panicked here...

		Silence from Jack...

					ADELLE (CONTD, O.S.)
			Jack...? Are you going through 
			the tunnel?

		Finally, Jack shakes his head, defeated.

					JACK
			Ill be there in twenty 
			minutes...

		CUT TO:

    121	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - NOON TIME

		Its a beehive of activity...

		Jacks TEAM, anxiously going over reports and flow 
		charts, working the phones, drinking coffee...

		Jack enters, still reeling from his experience, taking 
		a moment to observe the action...

		Mintz spots him...

					ALAN
				(into phone)
			Thank god, Jacks here. Ill 
			call you right back...

		He hangs up the phone as all eyes in the room turn to 
		Jack, immediately fixating on how disheveled he looks.

					ALAN (CONTD)
				(approaching)
			Jack, are you okay?

					JACK
				(in a daze)
			Whats going on here?

					ALAN
			Its not good.  Bob Thomas 
			has secretly been talking to 
			a European drug company.  
			Were not sure which one, 
			Julias on it right now.  
			Word is theyre willing to 
			let him buy a minority stake 
			and keep running the entire 
			company.  The Global people 
			are up in arms.  They say 
			we shouldve been prepared 
			for this.  Were in trouble 
			here, Jack...

		Jack looks at Alan for a minute.

					JACK
			You know something, Alan.  
			Theres a much more assertive 
			person somewhere inside of 
			you...

		Alan looks at him, confused.

					ALAN
			Excuse me?

					JACK
			But I think I like you better 
			this way...

					ALAN
			Is this another one of those 
			Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?

		A sad laugh from Jack.

					JACK
			No.

					ALAN
			So what are we gonna do, 
			Jack?

		Jack wallows for another moment in his own sadness...

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Jack...?		 

		Jack snaps out of it, turning to Alan and the rest of 
		the group...

					JACK
			Ill tell you exactly what 
			were going to do.  Youre
			going to do whatever you 
			have to do to find out which 
			European company hes been 
			talking to.  Then Im going 
			to clean myself up, fly to 
			Aspen, and drink egg nog 
			with Bob Thomas.  His wife 
			and kids will be playing in 
			the background while I spend 
			Christmas day convincing him 
			that the European company is 
			the devil and Global is the 
			answer to his prayers, after 
			all...
				(growing wistful)
			Then Im going to spend four 
			hours skiing. Alone. On 
			Christmas day. Completely 
			and utterly alone. Im going 
			to do that because that is 
			my life, that is whats 
			real, and there is nothing 
			I can do to change that...

		Jack leaves the office to the shocked stares of his 
		team.

    122	EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

		Jacks limo makes its way downtown.

    123	INT. LIMO - SAME TIME

		Jack in the back seat of the limo, sadly looking out 
		the window, watching the buildings pass by...

		He turns away, looks at the phone...haltingly picks it 
		up...

					JACK
				(dialing 411)
			For Manhattan...Kate 
			Reynolds...I need an address 
			too...

		Jack jots something down on a business card.  Then he 
		hangs up the phone, thinks a moment, looks out the 
		window, then turns to the driver...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Make a right here...

					DRIVER
			But the airports the other
			way...

					JACK
			Were not going to the 
			airport...

		CUT TO:

		123A	EXT. KATES BUILDING - DAY

		Jacks limo pulls up outside this house on Washington 
		Mews...

		Jack gets out...

    124	INT. EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

		Jack stands outside an apartment door.  He hears The 
		Clashs London Calling BLARING from inside.

		He rings the bell...the volume of the music gets 
		lower...

		Kates assistant, LORI, 20s, opens the door...Jack 
		exchanges a curious look with her.

					LORI
			Are you from the shipping 
			company?

					JACK
			Im Jack Campbell...Im an 
			old... friend of Kates.  
			I just called.

		The woman looks at him, then walks back inside...

					LORI (O.S.)
			Kate! Some guys here!

		Beat. Jack waits anxiously at the door. Then...

					KATE (O.S)
				(to Lori)
			Did you call the airline 
			like I asked?!

		Jacks eyes come alive as Kate appears wearing jeans 
		and a white blouse...except for her hair, she looks the 
		same.

					JACK
			Kate...

					KATE
			Jack...God, its been so 
			long...You look...

		She searches for a kind word, but he looks terrible.

					JACK
			You look great.

					KATE
			Its good to see you...

		She looks at him another moment, then turns...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(yelling inside)
			Lori! Wheres that box?!

		Kate walks inside, Jack follows her in sheepishly.

		125	INT. KATES APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack accidentally knocks into a stack of boxes, 
		sending a GLASS CANDY DISH CRASHING to the floor, 
		SHATTERING it...

					JACK
				(bending down)
			I'm sorry...

					KATE
			Dont worry about it, Jack...

		Jack looks up at...a beehive of activity  Lori on the 
		phone, boxes stacked everywhere, TWO MOVERS packing 
		up...

					JACK
			Whats going on?

					KATE
				(searching around)
			Im moving to Paris...it was 
			right here...
				(to Lori)
			Its a box marked Jack.  I 
			put it in the stack for the 
			Salvation Army...

					JACK
			Paris?

					LORI
				(to Kate, with 
				 attitude)
			Do you want me to look for 
			the box or call the airline?

					KATE
			Hey, kind of under a little 
			pressure here.

					LORI
			Hey, kind of giving up 
			Christmas day for my ex-boss 
			here.

		Jack watches this back and forth.

					KATE
			You didnt seem to mind 
			offering to help me on 
			Christmas day when you were 
			unwrapping that Prada bag 
			I gave you.

					LORI
			Maybe its by the wardrobe 
			boxes...

		Kate heads over to some tall wardrobe boxes.

					JACK
			Youre moving...

					KATE
			Uh huh. To Paris. My firm 
			has an office there and 
			Im going to be heading 
			it up.

					JACK
				(stunned)
			To Paris. Paris, France.

					KATE
				(searching the 
				 boxes)
			Thats the one...

					JACK
			So youre not at a non-
			profit firm?

					KATE
				(a chuckle)
			Not with what they pay me...

					JACK
			Youre not married, are 
			you?

					KATE
			No, Jack, I never got 
			married. You?

					JACK
			Not exactly...
				(looking around)
			Can we just take a minute 
			here?  Maybe get a cup of 
			coffee or something...?

					LORI
				(yelling)
			Ill go for a cup of coffee!

					KATE
			Yes!

		A relieved smile from Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I found it!

					LORI
			Congratulations. The La 
			Guardia flights canceled 
			but I got you out of 
			Kennedy on United at nine.  
			Am I good or what?

		Jacks smile disappears as Kate hands him a sealed box 
		marked, Jack...

					KATE
			Here you go.  Its just 
			some old things of yours...

		Jack stands here, looking at the box, then at Kate...

					JACK
			Do you ever think about us, 
			Kate?  About what might 
			have happened...?

		A bemused LAUGH from Kate.  Then she sees hes not 
		laughing...

					KATE
			Youre serious...

		A nod from Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			Ill tell you what, Jack, 
			if youre ever in Paris, 
			look me up. Maybe well 
			go for that cup of coffee.

		One of the movers passes by Jack carrying a box...

		Jack looks at Kate, flush with the realization that 
		this isnt the same woman he knew thirteen years 
		ago, or left yesterday.

					JACK
			Sure. Goodbye, Kate.

		He leaves...

		126	INT. JACKS APARTMENT - EVENING

		A scratchy Zeppelin album, the song All Of My Love, 
		fills the room. Jack, a fifth of Bushmills by his 
		side, goes through the box Kate gave him.

		He removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft 
		material, then a Mondale for President button, which 
		Jack smiles upon seeing, a couple Neil Young concert
		ticket stubs...

		He puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale 
		button on the lapel.  He digs back into the box, 
		finding...

		A messy, dog-eared copy of Cats Cradle...not the one 
		Kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced...

		Jack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness... 
		then...

		He looks over at the clock, it reads, 8:29.

		Snow is falling as Jacks car races up to the terminal 
		then stops. He jumps out. An AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD 
		sees him...

					AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD
			Hey, you cant leave that 
			there!

		Jack runs into the terminal, ignoring the guard...

	129	INT. UNITED TERMINAL - SECONDS LATER

		Jack looking at the board. The nine oclock to Paris - 
		Gate 8A. Jack sprints toward the gate...

	130	INT. UNITED TERMINAL, GATE AREA - SECONDS LATER

		...and gets there just as the flight is boarding.
		Jack looks through the crowd, spotting Kate near the 
		front of the line, about to hand her ticket to the gate 
		attendant.

		He pushes through the throng of people, drawing some 
		annoyed stares, finally making his way over to Kate.

					JACK
				(calling out)
			Kate!

		Kate turns and sees Jack, a look of puzzlement on her 
		face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You cant go!

					KATE
			Jesus, Jack...

					JACK
			Dont get on that plane!

					KATE
			Jack.

					JACK
			Please. Lets just go have 
			a cup of coffee. Thats all 
			Im asking for. Im sure 
			theres another flight to 
			Paris tonight.

					KATE
			What do you want from me? 
			You want me to tell you 
			everything that happened 
			was okay?

		Jack just stands there, unsure...

					KATE (CONTD)
			Well it is. Yes, I was 
			heartbroken ...But I got 
			over it. I moved on. 
			People change, Jack. I 
			changed. I dont know 
			why you suddenly feel the 
			need to revisit that time 
			in our lives but I assure 
			you, its over...

		Kate turns her back to Jack, leaving him standing 
		there...

		He watches her walk to the podium, realizing shes 
		right...

		He sees Kate reach the podium...hand her ticket to the 
		attendant...

		Finally, a look of determination crosses his face...

					JACK
				(at Kate)
			We have a house in Jersey!

		Kate turns to him with a look that could kill.

					KATE
			Dont do this, Jack...
			But he continues...

					JACK
			We have two kids, Annie and 
			Josh...

		...Kate looks at him, half-mortified, half-
		interested...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...Annies not much of a 
			violin player but she 
			tries really hard. Shes a 
			little precocious but thats 
			only because she says whats 
			on her mind. And when she 
			smiles...

		Jack shakes his head, remembering, fighting back the 
		tears...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And Josh...he has your eyes. 
			He doesnt say much but we 
			know hes smart...
				(lost in the memory)
			...hes always got his eyes 
			open, always watching us...
			sometimes you can look at 
			him and just know that hes 
			learning something new...
			its like witnessing a 
			miracle...

		Kates expression has sifted from annoyance to 
		curiosity.

					JACK (CONTD)
			...the house is a mess, but 
			its ours...
				(chuckling)
			...well, after a hundred 
			twenty two more payments 
			it will be...

		Jack begins walking slowly toward Kate...the world of 
		the airport going on around him, Jack not caring...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And you...youre a non-
			profit lawyer. Thats right, 
			completely non-profit. But 
			that doesnt seem to bother 
			you...

		Kate raises an eyebrow. Its something shes thought 
		about.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And were in love. After 
			thirteen years of marriage 
			were still unbelievably 
			in love...
				(with a chuckle)
			You wont even let me touch 
			you until Ive said it...

		Jack gets closer and closer...Kates spellbound now... 
		imagining the picture Jacks painting...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...I sing to you...not all 
			the time but definitely on 
			special occasions...

		Jack walks into a piece of carry-on luggage sitting by a 
		row of passengers...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(off hand, to passenger)
			Excuse me...
				(to Kate)
			We made a lot of sacrifices, 
			dealt with our share of 
			surprises, but we stayed 
			together...

		Jacks nearly there...

					JACK (CONTD)
			You see, youre a better 
			person than I am...

		Not in this life, and Kate knows it...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...and it made me a better 
			person to be around you...

		Kate is perfectly still, Jacks words echoing in her 
		ears.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Maybe it was all a 
			dream. Maybe I went to 
			bed one lonely night in 
			December and imagined it 
			all. But I swear, 
			nothings ever felt more 
			real to me...

		Hes right in front of her. She cant take her eyes 
		off him.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And if you get on that 
			plane right now, itll 
			disappear forever.

		Silence. Jack and Kate in their own little 
		world...airport business going on around them...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I know we can both go on 
			with our lives. And wed 
			both be fine. But Ive 
			seen what we can be like 
			together...And I choose 
			us...

		Jacks words resonate in her ears. He gently touches a 
		hand to her arm...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Please, Kate, one cup of 
			coffee. You can always go 
			to Paris. Just please, not 
			tonight...

		She stands there, frozen, staring into Jacks eyes, 
		searching for the answer.

					KATE
			Okay, Jack...

		DISSOLVE TO:

	131	INT. AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT

		Jack and Kate, framed in the window of a nearly empty 
		airport coffee shop...through the window, we see snow 
		falling outside.

		From a distance we see them...TALKING and LAUGHING over 
		a cup of coffee...

		FADE OUT.
CHAPTER ONE - EARLY HISTORY

	1	INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, PAN AM TERMINAL - NIGHT

		SUPER:  AUTUMN, 1987

		A line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to 
		London.

		JACK CAMPBELL, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, Tom 
		Selleck mustache,  the hopeful look of youth in his 
		eyes... sitting next to...

		KATE REYNOLDS, 21, pretty, Dorothy Hamill haircut...
		rubbing the tears from  her swollen red eyes...

					KATE
			I got you a few necessities...

		Kate hands Jack a new copy of Vonneguts Cats 
		Cradle.

					KATE  (CONTD)
			Your copy was a mess...

		Jack accepts the book but hes unable to take his eyes 
		off Kate.  She hands him a cassette.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Every one of these songs will 
			remind you of me in a slightly 
			different way...

					JACK
			All in one tape?

					KATE
			I also put side two of London 
			Calling on there...

		Kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the 
		lips.

					KATE  (CONTD)
			That was not officially the 
			goodbye kiss. It was just an 
			interim kiss...

		He looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her 
		close, kissing her deeply. Then...

					ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
			This will be the final boarding 
			call for Pan Am flight 4 to 
			London, Heathrow.

		Jack takes Kates hand, getting up, turning sadly to 
		the gate.

					KATE
			You have your ticket?

		Jack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE.  Kate 
		nods. They embrace and kiss again.  As they separate.

					JACK
			Im not even gonna say it, 
			Kate. Maybe itll be like 
			I never left...

		Jack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the 
		gate.

		Kate stands there, watching him go.  Then...

		...a  moment of intuition. Something isnt right. She 
		looks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway, 
		trying to decide...

					KATE
			Wait.

		Jack turns. Kate approaches him.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I have a bad feeling about 
			this.

					JACK
			About the plane? What do you 
			think its gonna crash? Dont 
			say that...

					KATE
				(shaking her head)
			I know weve talked about this a 
			thousand times and we both agree 
			that going to London is the 
			right thing to do. But in my 
			heart... this feels wrong.

		She looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, 
		then back into Jacks eyes.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Dont  go, Jack...

					JACK
			You mean dont go at all?  
			What about my internship?

					KATE
			Believe me I know what an 
			incredible opportunity this 
			is for you...

					JACK
			For us, Kate.

					KATE
			Right, for us. But...Im
			afraid that if you get on 
			that plane...

					JACK
			What?

		Kate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she cant 
		say...

					KATE
				(torn)
			Go. Im sorry, you should just 
			go...

					JACK
				(thinking, then...)
			No, youre right.  What are we 
			doing?

					KATE
			We're being responsible.  Go.
			Get on the plane.

		His eyes narrow as he measures her determination...

					KATE (CONT'D)
				(a smile)
			Get the hell outta my sight.
			You bother me.

		A laugh from Jack.  Kate gives him a calm smile and a
		nod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for
		Jack.

					JACK
				(resolute)
			Okay, I'm going...

		He takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her
		tight.  Jack looks toward the gate, the line
		disappearing...Kate grasps his shirt tightly.

					KATE
			I can't seem to let go of
			you...

					JACK
			You hear me complaining about
			that?

		A sober look in Jack's eyes.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			Look, we're at the airport and
			no one ever thinks clearly at
			the airport so we should just
			trust the decision we already
			made.  You've been accepted to
			one of the best law schools in
			the country, I've got this
			internship at Barclay's Bank.
			We have a great plan, honey...

		Kate nods, then, with resolve...

					KATE
			You want to do something
			great, Jack?  Let's flush the
			plan...start our lives right
			now, today...I don't know what
			that life's gonna look like
			but I do know it has both of
			us in it.  And I choose us...

		Jack is jolted by her words.

					KATE (CONT'D)
			The plan doesn't make us
			great, Jack.  What we have
			together, that's what makes us
			great.

		Her words sink in...A long moment of decision...He
		looks toward the gate, only one person left in
		line...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes.

		Finally...He kisses her deeply on the lips...

					JACK
			I love you, Kate...

		...a smile from Kate...relief...then...

					JACK (CONT'D)
				(taking her face in
				 his hands)
			...and a year in London's not
			gonna change that.  A hundred
			years couldn't change that...

		Jack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to
		the gate, handing the attendant his ticket, not able to
		look back.

		Kate watches him go, tears streaming down her face, as
		the gate door closes behind him.  She waits, almost
		willing it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it
		doesn't...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    1A	EXT. MANHATTAN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

		The skating rink at Central Park...Christmas tree at
		Rockefeller Center...the view down Fifth Avenue with
		Christmas decorations...Park Avenue.

	2	EXT. MANHATTAN - EARLY MORNING

		We close in on a spectacular pre-war doorman
		building...

	3	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		A huge space with gleaming hardwood floors, ornate
		moldings, and a great view of the Hudson and Jersey
		behind it...

		The place looks like a museum display...everything is
		of the highest quality and meticulously maintained.

		A wall of photos - Jack and Clinton, Jack with Patrick
		Ewing, Jack between Alan Greenspan and Henry Kravis.

		And a "Willie Mays" baseball bat encased in glass...

	4	INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...impeccably decorated and obsessively neat.

		Close in on the bed where JACK CAMPBELL, now 35, sans
		mustache and long hair, opens his eyes.
		A FLASH of bright morning light from the window.  Jack
		shields his eyes, turning his head toward the bathroom
		where he sees...

		A WOMAN'S BACK...draped in a towel...an incredible
		back, neither flabby nor overly toned, beautifully
		curved...Jack focuses on it a moment. As the woman
		turns to him...

		PAULA.  Beautiful, late 20s, a toothbrush in her
		mouth...

					PAULA
				(holding up toothbrush)
			   I hope you don't mind.  There
			   were like ten new ones in the
			   cabinet.

		A playful smile from Paula.

					JACK
			   It's not what you think.  I
			   took Mentadent public...

		Paula smiles, moves over to a chair and grabs a little
		black dress hanging neatly over it.

					PAULA
			   Did you really mean what you
			   said about Tuscany?

					JACK
			   Of course I did.

					PAULA
			   Last night was great...

					JACK
			   You are an amazing lover.  You
			   should be giving motivational
			   seminars.

					PAULA
			   Thanks.  You're not bad
			   yourself...

		Jack grabs his Frank Mueller watch from the night
		stand, puts it on his wrist.  He looks at Paula as she
		slips the dress on.

					JACK
			   I want to see you again.

					PAULA
			   I'd like that, too.

			JACK
			   Tonight.

		She turns to him.

					PAULA
			   It's Christmas Eve, Jack.

					JACK
			   So we'll get egg nog.

		Paula laughs.

					PAULA
				(putting on her shoes)
			   I have to go to my parents'
			   house out in Jersey.  Would
			   you like to come?

					JACK
			   Jersey?  You know what the
			   traffic's gonna be like?

					PAULA
			   I'm taking the train...

		Paula approaches Jack, leaning over him, her long hair
		dangling on his chest.

					PAULA (CONT'D)
			   Don't you have anywhere to go?

					JACK
			   I've got plenty of places to
			   go.

		He stays there, confident, sexy, waiting for an
		answer...

					PAULA
				(a sexy laugh, then...)
			   Maybe I can try and sneak away
			   some time tomorrow morning...
				(kissing him on 
				 the lips)
			   Okay?

					JACK
				(coy)
			   If it's something you feel
			   strongly about.
 
		Paula walks to the door, then turns back to Jack.

					PAULA
			It was nice meeting you, Jack...

		CHAPTER TWO - MAIN TITLES

    4A	INT. JACKS APARTMENT - MORNING

		Jack saunters over to a Yamaha Grand Disclavier in the 
		living room.  He puts a disk into the piano and...

		...the keys come alive with the music of BACH.  Jack 
		hits a switch and suddenly the entire apartment is 
		enveloped in music...

    4B	INT. JACKS BUILDING, CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

		Paula, waiting for the elevator, hears the MUSIC 
		emanating from Jacks apartment...an intrigued glance 
		back at the apartment door as the elevator arrives...

	5	INT. JACKS BATHROOM - MORNING

		Backs Passion According to St. Matthew is blaring 
		through the speakers, the music is swelling to full 
		orchestra...

		Jacks at the mirror in this incredibly neat marble-
		tiled bathroom, shaving with a silver-plated Hammacher 
		Schlemmer razor, HUMMING with the orchestra...

	6	INT. JACKS CLOSET - MORNING

		...the size of a small house, a long row of Zegna 
		suits, shoe trees stacked with Italian shoes, tailored 
		shirts everywhere.

		Jacks still HUMMING to the music as he dresses in 
		front of a mirror.

	7	INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

		Jack, wearing an elegant camels hair overcoat and 
		carrying a leather briefcase, a Master of the 
		Universe smile on his face, now HUMMING the Bach piece 
		from memory...

		The doors open at 6.  Jack self-consciously stops 
		singing as ELIZABETH PETERSON, 60s, wearing a mink 
		coat, gets on the elevator carrying a yappy little dog.

					JACK
				(a charming smile)
			   Mrs. Peterson.

					MRS. PETERSON
			   Hello Jack.  You dont 
			   have to stop singing on 
			   my account...

					JACK
			   Its because Im shy, 
			   Betty.  So, when are you 
			   going to leave that old 
			   corpse Mr. Peterson and 
			   run away with me?

					MRS. PETERSON
			   You know you could never 
			   satisfy me the way he 
			   does...

		The doors open to the lobby.  Mrs. Peterson walks out 
		ahead.

	8	INT. JACKS BUILDING, LOBBY - MORNING

		TONY THE DOORMAN holds the door open for Jack and Mrs. 
		Peterson...

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   Merry Christmas, Mr. 
			   Campbell.

					JACK
			   Howd you do this year, 
			   Tony?

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   About four grand.  And a 
			   bottle of twenty five 
			   year old scotch from Mrs. 
			   Johnson in 9D.  Im 
			   putting it all in 
			   commercial paper like you 
			   said.

					JACK
			   Just until the Deutsche 
			   Mark turns...

		Jack exits the building...

	9   OMITTED

    9A	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari racing through the park...

    10	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MORNING

		A modern Wall Street building.  The sign above the 
		glass doors reads, P.K. Lassiter and Associates, 
		Investment House.

		The Ferrari SCREECHES to a halt.  Jack gets out, heads 
		into the building...

    10A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack throws his keys to a nearby SECURITY GUARD with a 
		smile on his way to the elevators...

		CHAPTER THREE - JACK THE BUSINESSMAN

		DISSOLVE TO:

    11	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

		The Manhattan skyline shines through the windows of
		this beautiful conference room.

		SIX EXECUTIVES are seated at a huge oak table littered
		with coffee cups and lunch waste.  At the end of the
		table, ALAN MINTZ, 30s, balding, sits with a faraway
		look in his eyes, three empty Diet Coke cans in front
		of him.

		Mintz is poking at a shiny gold cherub dangling from a
		small, plastic Christmas tree, sitting in the middle of
		the table.

		Jack is addressing the group from the front of the
		room, standing in front of a computer with a huge flat
		screen monitor, covered with stock charts and tables...

					JACK
			   ...if MedTech's shares sink
			   any lower than...
				(casually executing 
				 a keystroke)
			   ...forty three, we're in
			   trouble with the stock
			   valuation.  So for god's sake
			   watch what you say to your
			   institutional customers...

		Jack notices Alan Mintz playing with the cherub.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   ...we still have almost a full
			   day of trading before zero
			   hour and I don't want any
			   trouble...
				(distracted by Mintz)
			   ...penny for your thoughts,
			   Alan...

		Alan looks up.

					ALAN
			   Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and
			   the kids I'd be home by
			   dinner.  You know, it being
			   Christmas Eve and all.

					JACK
			   Is that tonight?

		A LAUGH from the group.  Jack approaches Alan.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   You think I like being here on
			   Christmas Eve, Alan?

					ALAN
			   I don't know.  Maybe...

		Another LAUGH.  Even Jack lets out a good-natured
		chuckle.

					JACK
			   Okay, maybe I do have a touch
			   of tunnel vision this holiday
			   season.  But in two days we're
			   going to announce one of the
			   largest mergers in U.S.
			   corporate history.  Thirty
			   billion dollars...
				(basking in the glory)
			   When this kind of deal turns
			   up you get on and you ride it
			   `till it's over.  You don't
			   ask it for a vacation...

		A chuckle from the group...the esprit de corps seems to
		energize Jack.

					JACK (CONT'D)
				(to the group)
			   December 26th.  After that
			   there'll be so much money
			   floating around here it'll be
			   like Christmas every day...
				(smiling)
			   December 26th, people.  If
			   you'd like to celebrate that
			   day, you all have my
			   blessing...

		Enthusiastic nods and words of agreement from the suits
		around the table...

					ALAN
			   You're right, Jack.  Sorry...
			   Jack approaches Alan.

					JACK
			   I don't want you to be sorry,
			   Alan, I want you to be
			   excited.  I want my gift to be
			   the first one you open this
			   year.  You know why?

					ALAN
			   Why Jack?

					JACK
			   Because my gift comes with ten
			   zeroes at the end...

		A MURMUR of excitement in the room, even Alan cracks a
		smile.  Jack puts a hand on Alan's shoulder.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Good man...

    12	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

		The conference room door opens and the SIX ENERGIZED
		SUITS emerge, each met by an ASSISTANT handing them
		messages.

		Jack is the last one out.  He's met in stride by
		ADELLE, 50s, carrying a Filofax and a pile of phone
		messages.

					ADELLE
			   Only eight thirty?  What's the
			   matter, had some last minute
			   shopping to do?

		Jack pops a peppermint Lifesaver in his mouth as Adelle
		hands him his messages.

					JACK
			   You too?  This holiday's about
			   giving, Adelle.  And I'm
			   giving everything I've got to
			   this deal, so in a way, I'm
			   more Christmassy than
			   anyone...
				(holding out the candy)
			   Lifesaver?

					ADELLE
				(ignoring the candy)
			   You're a ray of sunshine,
			   Jack.

		They approach an office, the words, "Jack Campbell -
		President" stenciled on the glass...

    13	INT. JACK'S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		...continuing past Adelle's desk, Jack looking at his
		messages, and into Jack's office...

    14	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		A cavernous office, you could land a helicopter in it -
		high tech fixtures, full bar, leather sofa, $3,000
		Stairmaster...

		Jack walks to an enormous, bare mahogany desk, and sits
		down in a high tech ergonomic leather chair.

					ADELLE
			   Oh, and Oxxford called...

					JACK
			   Ooh, my suits are ready...

		He gets to the last message, sees the name on it, and
		reels back.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Kate Reynolds...

					ADELLE
			   Her assistant said you could
			   call her at home after eight.

		Jack stares at the message like he's looking at a
		ghost.

					JACK
			   Her assistant?

					ADELLE
			   Yeah Jack, her assistant...

					JACK
				(lost in the message)
			   Kate Reynolds was my
			   girlfriend in college.  I
			   almost married her...

					ADELLE
				(a hearty LAUGH)
			   You?  Married?

					JACK
				(snapping out of it)
			   Almost married.  And almost a
			   junior broker at E.F.
			   Hutton...

					ADELLE
			   Excuse me?

					JACK
			   She didn't want me to go to
			   London.  We're standing at the
			   airport saying goodbye and she
			   asks me to stay.

					ADELLE
			   So you left her?  Just like
			   that?

					JACK
			   God, no.  I thought about it
			   for practically the entire
			   flight...

					ADELLE
			   Stop Jack, I'm getting all
			   weepy.

					JACK
			   I took the road less traveled,
			   Adelle.

					ADELLE
			   And look where it's led you...
				(picking up the phone)
			   I'm gonna get her on the
			   phone...

		Jack pauses, focused on the message, his mind drifting
		back...

		Adelle begins dialing the number.  Finally, Jack
		reaches out and hangs up the phone.

					JACK
			   No...

					ADELLE
			   No?!  You almost married this
			   woman.  Aren't you even
			   curious what she wants?

					JACK
			   She's probably just having a
			   fit of nostalgia.  You know,
			   lonely Christmas Eve, call the
			   one that got away, that kind
			   of thing.

		Adelle rolls her eyes at him.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   I'm telling you, it's ancient
			   history...

		Jack looks up as PETER LASSITER, 60s, founder and
		chairman of P.K. Lassiter and Associates, saunters into
		the room.

					LASSITER
			   Eight forty-five on Christmas
			   Eve and Jack Campbell is still
			   at his desk.  There's a
			   Hallmark moment for you...

		Lassiter heads to the bar like he's done it a million
		times.

					JACK
			   Peter.  I don't see you
			   rushing home to trim the tree.

					LASSITER
				(pouring himself 
				 a scotch)
			   That's because I'm a heartless
			   bastard who only cares about
			   money.

					JACK
			   And God love you for it.

		Lassiter drops down in a soft leather chair opposite
		Jack.

					LASSITER
				(sipping the scotch)
			   I just got a call from Terry
			   Haight.  Bob Thomas is
			   nervous...

					JACK
			   That'll happen when you're
			   about to spend thirty billion
			   dollars on some aspirin...

					LASSITER
			   Someone's gonna have to nurse
			   him through this.

					JACK
			   Why are you staring at my
			   breasts, Peter?

					LASSITER
			   I need you, tiger..

					JACK
			   Where is he?

					LASSITER
			   Aspen.

		Jack pauses for a beat.

					JACK
				(to Adelle)
			   Call Aunt Irma.  Tell her I
			   won't be able to make it
			   tomorrow...

		Adelle rolls her eyes at him...

					LASSITER
			   You're a credit to capitalism,
			   Jack.

		Jack glances at Adelle, then looks back at Lassiter.

					JACK
			   Hey Peter, lemme ask you a
			   question.  An old girlfriend
			   calls you out of the blue on
			   Christmas Eve...

					LASSITER
			   You suddenly having trouble
			   getting dates?

					JACK
			   Not by a long shot.

					LASSITER
			   Then leave it in the past.
			   Old flames are like old tax
			   returns.  You keep `em in the
			   file cabinet for three years
			   and then you cut `em loose.

		Jack shoots Adelle a satisfied smile, crumpling up
		Kate's message and tossing a perfect hook into a N.Y.
		Knicks hoop.

					JACK
				(to Adelle)
			   I'll leave from the office
			   tomorrow afternoon.  Call the
			   group.  Schedule an emergency
			   strategy session for noon.

					ADELLE
			   That'll be a nice little
			   holiday treat.

    15	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

		A single light remains on in the building.

    16	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

		Jack is alone in the office working on his computer,
		checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor.

		Jack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes.  He
		checks his watch.  It's past eleven.  He gets up, goes
		to the window, sees the city in all its Christmas
		glory, then he see it...

		...the message from Kate, crumpled in the
		trashcan...then turns back to the window, gazing out at
		the night...

    17	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT

		Jack comes out of the elevator, walking past the lobby
		desk where FRANK, a security guard, sits watching the
		monitors.

					FRANK
			   Mr. Campbell.  Why didn't you
			   call down, I would've had Joe
			   get your ride.

		Jack looks outside the front door to the snowy, quiet
		street.

					JACK
			   I'm thinking I might walk
			   tonight, Frank.

					FRANK
			   Nice night for it.  I'll have
			   Louis send your car home.

		A nod from Jack.

					FRANK (CONT'D)
			   Merry Christmas to you, sir...

					JACK
			   Thanks.  To you too...

		Jack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads
		out into the crisp night air...

    18	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINOUS

		Jack emerges from the building, walking across the
		large plaza, past the fountain...snow begins to fall...

    19	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack's walking down the nearly empty street, snow
		falling down on him, a bounce in his step, looking at
		the windows of the closed shops along the way.

		He gets to the end of the block spots the Wong
		Brothers' 24 Hour Deli across the street...

		He heads toward it...

    20	INT. WONG BROTHERS' DELI - SECONDS LATER
 
		Jack walks into the brightly lit deli...

		SAM WONG, 20s, is with his 80-year-old GRANDFATHER
		behind the counter.  There's a NERDY COLLEGE KID at the
		salad bar, a drunken DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA at the
		liquor display, a WOMAN with a BABY in an aisle and...

		...a BLACK MAN, 30s, with a dollar sign and the name
		"CASH" tattooed on his arm, stands in front of the
		coffee machine...

					CASH
			   Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!  She's
			   a certified winner...paper-
			   thin but good as gold...

		Jack notices Cash talking to himself, seemingly crazy.

		Jack approaches Sam Wong at the counter.

					JACK
			   Egg nog?

					SAM WONG
				(pointing)
			   Dairy case.  Five dollar.

					CASH
				(in the b.g., to 
				 Sam Wong)
			   Y'all do the lotto here...?
			   `Cause I got me a winner...I
			   know, I know, Lotto keeps the
			   black man down... but not
			   me...

		Jack grabs a carton of egg nog, then notices Cash
		handing Sam Wong his ticket.  Jack heads back toward
		the counter...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   ...06...14...18...48...right
			   there.  Four numbers...that's
			   two hundred and thirty eight
			   dollar...
				(a smile)
			   Merry Christmas and shit...

					SAM WONG
				(barely looking 
				 at ticket)
			   Ticket bad.  You draw in lines
			   with pencil.

					CASH
			   What're you talkin' about?

					SAM WONG
				(throwing the ticket 
				 back)
			   You draw lines with pencil!  I
			   know about this!

		The woman with the baby looks over...the college kid
		looks up, nervous...the drunken Santa, bottle of
		bourbon in hand, starts to walk by Jack...Jack
		instinctively puts an arm out, holding the Santa
		back...

					CASH
			   What!?  Look at the ticket...!

					SAM WONG
			   Get out, I call 911.

		The Santa looks at Jack, confused.

					CASH
			   You're lookin' at me, you're
			   not even lookin' at the
			   ticket!

		The woman with the baby puts a loaf of bread back on
		the shelf, starts nervously inching toward the door.

					SAM WONG
			   You leave now.  Take ticket
			   somewhere else.
				(calling out)
			   Next customer in line...!

					CASH
			   You first generation,
			   xenophobic, money-theistic,
			   hot pastrami sandwich
			   making...

					SAM WONG
				(screaming)
			   Get out!

		Just watching...Cash shoves the ticket in Sam Wong's
		face...

					CASH
			   LOOK AT THE GODDAMN TICKET!!

		A moment of decision for Jack.  Then...

					JACK
				(carefully)
			   Let me see that ticket.

		Cash turns to Jack.

					CASH
				(menacing)
			   Was I talkin' to you?!

		Jack looks at the woman, the college kid, the Santa,
		then...

					JACK
			   Maybe I'll buy it from you.

		Now Cash walks over to Jack...

					CASH
			   Guy in $2,000 suit gets ass
			   kicked tryin' to be a hero.
			   Film at eleven...
				(then...turning to 
				 the coffee machine)
			   What?!  Oh no, not another
			   lookie-loo.  You know how big
			   a job this is?

		The patrons exchange nervous glances...Jack watches,
		confused.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   You're double bookin' me!
			   You're gonna get double
			   billed!  Shit!

		Cash throws a bottle of Perrier against the wall, it
		SHATTERS.  The woman reels back in terror with the
		baby...

					JACK
			   Hey, c'mon...

		In a flash, Cash whips a .38 from the back of his
		pants, aiming it at Jack's face.  The woman SCREAMS,
		covers her baby.

					CASH
				(in Jack's face)
			   Do you want to die?

		Jack stares at Cash, trying his best to keep his
		cool...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   DO YOU WANNA DIE?!

					JACK
			   No.
 
					CASH
				(a smile)
			   Yes you do...

					JACK
			   Look, I'm talking about a
			   business deal here.  I buy the
			   ticket for two hundred, take
			   it to a store where the guy
			   behind the counter...
				(glaring at Sam Wong)
			   ...doesn't have a death wish
				(back to Cash)
			   ...I just made myself a quick
			   thirty eight dollars.

		Cash gets closer...

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   Like I said, it's a business
			   deal...

					CASH
			   Damn, you are the real
			   thing...

		Cash narrows his eyes...then, a smile as he puts the
		gun back into his pants...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   C'mon, Jack, let's get outta
			   here...
				(to Sam Wong)
			   You were lookin' at me, papa,
			   you shoulda been lookin' at
			   the ticket.  That ticket was
			   legit, B.  You're fake...

		Cash starts out of the deli.  Jack follows...

    21	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Cash walking down the street...Jack, holding
		his carton of egg nog under his arm, counting out two
		hundred dollars...

					JACK
			   How'd you know my name was
			   Jack?

					CASH
			   I call all you white guys
			   "Jack."

		Jack nods...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   You know you seem pretty
			   relaxed for a guy who just had
			   a gun pulled on him.

					JACK
			   There's no way I was gonna die
			   in that deli...
				(off Cash's look)
			   Let's just say I've been on a
			   lucky streak lately.

					CASH
				(a big LAUGH)
			   A lucky streak, huh?

		Jack hands him the money.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   Sound pretty sure of yourself,
			   don't you?

		Jack nods.

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   So you're telling me, you've
			   got a gun to your head and you
			   don't think for one second,
			   what if this, what if that,
			   maybe I shouldn't do this, I
			   shoulda done that.

					JACK
			   I don't do that.  That's just
			   not for me...

		Cash looks at him, then smiles.

					CASH
			   Okay, Jack.  Nice doing
			   business with you...
			   Cash is about to take off...

					JACK
			   Hey...

		Cash turns around.

					JACK (CONT'D)
			   What do you want to carry that
			   gun around for, anyway?
			   You're just gonna do something
			   you'll regret...

					CASH
			   You want to talk about
			   regrets, you're talking to the
			   wrong person.

		Jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag, opens
		the carton...

					JACK
			   I'm just saying that you seem
			   like a smart guy.  At a
			   certain point you're gonna do
			   something, and then there's no
			   turning back...

					CASH
			   Yeah, in most cases that'd be
			   true.

		Jack takes a sip of the egg nog.

					JACK
			   I mean there must be programs
			   out there, opportunities...

					CASH
				(a deep laugh)
			   Wait a minute, wait a
			   minute... you're tryin' to
			   save me?

		A look from Jack...

					CASH (CONT'D)
			   Oh man, you're serious...
				(out to the street)
			   This man thinks I need to be
			   saved!

					JACK
			   Everyone needs something.

		Cash looks at Jack...

					CASH
			   Yeah?  What do you need?

					JACK
			   Me?

					CASH
			   You just said everyone needs
			   something.

					JACK
			   I've got everything I need.

					CASH
			   Wow.  It must be great being
			   you.  You got it all.

		Cash looks at Jack.  He smiles and shakes his head.

					JACK
			   Look, I'm not saying you'd be
			   able to do it without some
			   hard work...

					CASH
				(a hearty LAUGH)
			   You still think this is about
			   me, don't you?

					JACK
			   Sure it's about you.  But it's
			   about society, too.

					CASH
			   Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this
			   one... Just remember, Jack,
			   you did this.  You brought
			   this on yourself...

		And with that, Cash turns and leaves Jack alone on the
		street with his egg nog...

    22	INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks in and throws his keys on a table.  He takes
		off his gloves and overcoat, glances at the mail, then
		heads into the bedroom.

		Through the large windows we see snow falling...

    23	INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep...

		CHAPTER FOUR - A DIFFERENT LIFE

		DISSOLVE TO:

    24	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

		Close in on Jacks face, bathed in morning light...he 
		opens his eyes...feels something strange...

		Jack looks down...theres a womans head resting on his 
		chest.

		A look of confusion crosses his face...trying to 
		remember... did he meet a woman last night...?

		He turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting 
		faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail...

		...did she have a dog?

		He looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to 
		get a look at her face.  And then he sees her...

		...KATE REYNOLDS...

		...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter 
		contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...

		His head darts around the room - its cramped and lived 
		in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on 
		the dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed 
		and a charming little bay window.

		He instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch 
		on the night stand, but its not there.  Its a Timex 
		Indiglo and it reads, 7:57 A.M...

		Jack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe its 
		a dream...but nothing changes.  Then, Kate stirs...

					KATE
			   Mmmm...ten more minutes, 
			   Jack... its Christmas...

		Jack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time...

		Suddenly, the door bursts open...A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL, 
		ANNIE, in a little nightgown, walks into the room 
		carrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY, JOSH, SINGING at the top 
		of her lungs...

					ANNIE
			   Jingle bells, Santa s
			   mells, Rudolph laid an 
			   egg...la la la, la-la la 
			   la, la la la la la...

		Annie places Josh on the bed and then jumps up 
		herself.  She gestures to the dog, patting the bed.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   You too, Luce...

		The dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed, joining 
		everybody else and leaving very little room.  Annie 
		starts jumping.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   Rise...and...shine...!

					KATE
				(stirring)
			   Youre jumping, 
			   sweetheart...

		Jack looks at this activity like a man at his own 
		funeral.

					ANNIE
			   Mom, dont you think we 
			   need to open the 
			   presents?

					KATE
				(groggy)
			   Mommy needs five more 
			   minutes in la la land.  
			   That could be her 
			   present...

		Josh crawls directly up to Jacks stomach, climbing 
		on.

					ANNIE
			   Cmon, Dad.  Get up!

		She said Dad.

		Thats it.  Jack moves the baby gingerly over, then 
		gets out of bed, stumbling over a baseball bat lying 
		next to it.

		He picks up the bat...the same Willie Mays autograph 
		bat that was encased in glass in his N.Y. apartment.

		Frightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself 
		for the first time...hes naked...

		...a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on 
		the bed...

		...he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow 
		cardigan off the chair and throws them on...

		Kate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand.

					KATE
			   Jack...?

		Jack turns by instinct.  Kate grabs him, drawing him 
		near.  A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her 
		eyes...

		Eye contact...Jacks certain hes about to hear her 
		scream...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(still groggy)
			   Strong coffee, okay?

		She lets him go as Jack backs out the door...

    25	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

		A garishly decorated Christmas tree sits in the middle 
		of this messy and disorganized living room, a bevy of 
		gifts underneath and four red stockings over the 
		fireplace.

		Jack darts to the top of the steps...

					KATE (O.S.)
				(calling from 
				 the bedroom)
			   Use an entire can if you 
			   have to!

		He looks back at the bedroom, then at the 
		stairs...quickly heading down the CREAKY steps, still 
		in shock.

		He grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front 
		door...about to step out when he looks down and 
		realizes...

		...hes barefoot.  He glances at a pair of rubber over-
		boots sitting by the door, slips them on, just about to 
		leave when...

		He hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the door 
		lock...Jack looks at the door, not quite sure what to 
		do...

		The door opens...into the house, arms laden with 
		wrapped gifts, walk BIG ED and LORRAINE REYNOLDS (both 
		60s), Kates parents.  Big Eds wearing a ten gallon 
		hat and a suede overcoat.  Lorraine has a cigarette 
		dangling from her mouth.

					JACK
				(drawing on a 
				 memory)
			   Ed?  Lorraine?

		Big Ed hugs Jack as best he can with an armful of 
		gifts.

					BIG ED
			   Jack you ol bird dog.  
			   Merry Christmas to ya...

		Lorraine plants a big fat kiss on Jacks cheek.

					LORRAINE
			   Talk to him, Jack.  
			   Please.  One day a year 
			   away from the Ponderosa.  
			   I dont think thats too 
			   much to ask.

					BIG ED
			   I heard that.  This is 
			   who I am, woman!
				(a wink to Jack)
			   Tell her, Jack!  Youre 
			   the only one who gets me, 
			   for gods sake!

		Jack, still holding the door open, plotting his escape.

					LORRAINE
			   I need some egg nog...

					BIG ED
			   Course you do.  Hell, 
			   its almost 8 a.m.  
				(shouting upstairs)
			   Where are my two lil 
			   pardners?  Annie!  Josh!  
			   Giddy up, Bid Eds here!

					JACK
			   Excuse me.

		Jack dashes out the door.

					LORRAINE
			   Where are you going, 
			   Jack?
				(to Big Ed)
			   Wheres he going?

					BIG ED
			   Damned if I know...

		They start to remove their coats, when...

		The door flies back open...

					JACK
			   Wheres my car?!  Wheres 
			   my Ferrari!?

					BIG ED
			   What the hell are you 
			   talking about?
				(to Lorraine)
			   Whats he talking about?

					JACK
			   Look, can I just borrow 
			   your car?!  I promise 
			   itll be returned!

					BIG ED
			   The Caddy?  Why dont you 
			   take your own damn car!

					LORRAINE
			   Oh just let him borrow 
			   your precious Cadillac, 
			   for gods sake.

		Jack spots a set of keys hanging on a hook.

					BIG ED
			   Hes got a perfectly good 
			   mini-van sitting out 
			   there in the driveway!

		Jack grabs the keys off the hook...darts back outside...

    26	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

		Jack emerges from this charming, suburban two-story 
		house, some tasteful Christmas lights decorating a tree 
		in the center of the snow-covered lawn...

		He races to a blue Dodge mini-van sitting in the 
		driveway, a My Ferrari Is In The Shop sticker on the 
		rear bumper.  He climbs into the mini-van and peels out 
		of the driveway...

    27	INT. MINI-VAN - SECONDS LATER

		Jack sees a sign, George Washington Bridge - 3 miles...

    28	INT. MINI-VAN - MINUTES LATER

		Jack driving over the bridge.  A sigh of relief as he 
		passes under a sign for Manhattan.

    29	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - EARLY MORNING

		The mini-van pulls up near Jacks apartment building.  
		Jack, still wearing pajamas under the coat, leaps out, 
		running toward the grand entrance where Tony stands 
		sternly in front.

					JACK
			   Tony, thank god...

		Jack starts to walk past but Tony blocks the way.

					TONY THE DOORMAN
			   Sorry, pal.  Entrance is 
			   for residents and guests 
			   only...

					JACK
			   What are you talking 
			   about?  Its me, Jack 
			   Campbell.  Penthouse C.  
			   I put you into commercial 
			   paper!

					TONY THE DOORMAN
				(not moving)
			   Uh-huh...

		Just then, Mrs. Peterson walks to the door with 
		her little DOG.  Tony opens the door for her...

					JACK
			   Elizabeth Peterson!

		The little dog starts BARKING ferociously at Jack.

					MRS. PETERSON
				(to Tony re: 
				 Jack, annoyed)
			   Who is this man?

		Tony shrugs his shoulders.

					JACK
			   You know me, Betty.  You 
			   do.  Jack Campbell.  
			   Were on the co-op board 
			   together.  We fought side 
			   by side for garbage 
			   disposals.  Every morning 
			   we exchange quasi-sexual 
			   witty banter.  Think...

		She looks at Jack with a raised eyebrow, the dog still 
		YAPPING.

					TONY THE DOORMAN
				(to Mrs. Peterson)
			   Should I call the cops?  
			   Im gonna call the 
			   cops...

		Jack pleads to her with his eyes.

					MRS. PETERSON
				(raising a hand 
				 to Tony)
			   No...

					JACK
				(a sigh of relief)
			   Thank you, Betty.  I know 
			   if I can just sleep this 
			   off, Ill be fine...

					MRS. PETERSON			
			   And sleep you shall.  
			   Noblesse oblige is not 
			   dead.  Not yet 
			   anyway...Come, lets get 
			   you some help.  Surely 
			   there must be a shelter 
			   somewhere in this city.

					JACK
			   A shelter?!  Im the 
			   richest guy in the 
			   building...Ive got twice 
			   the square footage you 
			   have!

		Mrs. Peterson shakes her head at him, a look of pity on 
		her face.

		Frustrated, Jack turns and runs back to the mini-van...

		CUT TO:

    30	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

		Jack pulls up across the street and gets out of the 
		van.  Running across the empty plaza toward the 
		building entrance...

    31	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

		Jack bursts through the door, approaching the lobby 
		desk where FRANK the security guard sits.

		Frank spots Jack and blocks his way.

					FRANK
			   Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold 
			   it right there...

					JACK
			   Frank.  Wheres Alan 
			   Mintz?  Is he here yet?

					FRANK
			   Mr. Mintz?
				(a knowing chuckle)
			   I dont think 
			   so...buildings closed 
			   pal.  Youll have to come 
			   back tomorrow.

					JACK
			   Look, I dont know whats 
			   going on here but I am 
			   Senior Vice President of 
			   this company.

					FRANK
			   I dont care who you 
			   are.  Its Christmas and 
			   like I told you the 
			   building is closed.

					JACK
			   Maybe youre not hearing 
			   me.  I am Jack 
			   Campbell...
				(approaching the 
				 building directory)
			   Right here.  Jack 
			   Campbell, President...

		And then he sees it...ALAN MINTZ - PRESIDENT, listed 
		plain as day on the building director...

		Jack looks at Frank, then back to the building 
		directory...

		A pitying look from Frank...Jack stands there, in 
		shock...

		CHAPTER FIVE - WHATS HAPPENING?

    32	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING, PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

		...its desolate...

		Jack walks through the plaza like a zombie, his face 
		registering nothing.  He crosses the street, moving
		toward the mini-van...oblivious...when...

		SCREECH...a Ferrari 456M stops within inches of Jacks 
		torso...a VOICE from the car...

					VOICE (O.S.)
			   Hey!  Watch where youre 
			   walking!

		Jack turns...sees the DRIVER low in the seat...cant 
		quite make out the face...

					VOICE 
			   You almost dented my two 
			   hundred thousand dollar 
			   car!

		Jack...still stunned...looks at the car, very 
		familiar...the voice of the driver, also familiar...

					VOICE (CONTD)
			   Thats right!  My new 
			   cars worth more than 
			   your shitty house!

		A look of realization on Jacks face...

					VOICE (CONTD)
			   I feel like I really did 
			   win the lottery!

		...its Cash, and hes in Jacks car...

		Jack moves over to the passenger window in shock...a 
		smile from Cash...

					CASH
			   Miss me, Jack?

					JACK
			   Thats my car!  You stole 
			   my car!

					CASH
			   Its a callable asset 
			   seized in accordance with 
			   the acquisition by-laws 
			   of your alt-fate 
			   contract...

					JACK
			   What?!

					CASH
			   Basically, its my car 
			   now.  Get in.

		Cash reaches over and opens the door.  Jack 
		hesitates...

					CASH (CONTD)
			   Look, I dont make the 
			   rules, Jack.  This is how 
			   it works.  Get in.

		Cash gives him a reassuring look.  Jack gets in...

    33	INT. FERRARI - CONTINUOUS

		Jack closes the door...Cash joyfully drives off in a 
		burst of acceleration...Jack practically ends up in the 
		back seat...

					CASH
			   Might wanna fasten your 
			   seat belt, Jack...

					JACK
				(recovering)
			   What the hell is 
			   happening to me?!

		Jacks freaking out and Cash is enjoying every minute 
		of it.  Cash hands Jack a paper bag.  Jack starts 
		breathing into the bag.

					CASH
			   This kinda thing makes a 
			   lotta guys throw up.  
			   Seen it happen.  So if 
			   you get the urge, do it 
			   out the window.
				(with a taunting 
				 laugh)
			   I dont want you marring 
			   this exquisite leather 
			   interior...

		Cash looks over at Jack...hes really losing it, 
		sobbing into the bag...almost hyperventilating...Cash 
		smiles...

					CASH (CONTD)
			   Look, I dont know what 
			   youre getting so worked 
			   up about, you did 
			   this...you brought this 
			   on yourself.

					JACK
			   Brought what on myself?!  
			   I didnt do anything!

					CASH
			   No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive 
			   got everything I need, I 
			   dont have regrets, 
			   thats just not for me... 
			   sound familiar?

					JACK
			   You mean because you 
			   thought I was cocky Im 
			   now on a permanent acid 
			   trip?!!

		Cash gets a laugh out of Jacks overreaction...

					CASH
			   Everyone else in that 
			   store is a statue, they 
			   see their lives passing 
			   in front of their eyes, 
			   but not you.  Youre 
			   making a business deal...

					JACK
				(enraged)
			   Give me my goddamn life 
			   back!

					CASH
			   You?  What about me?  Im 
			   working hard for you 
			   here, Jack.  On Christmas 
			   too!  Now you did a good 
			   thing last night, 
			   intervening that way.  I 
			   was moved...

					JACK
				(interrupting)
			   Please.  Just tell me 
			   whats happening to me.  
			   In plain English.  None 
			   of that mumbo jumbo...

		Cash turns to Jack.

					CASH
			   Its a glimpse, Jacko.

					JACK
			   I glimpse?  A glimpse of 
			   what!?  What glimpse?!  
			   Glimpse!

					CASH
			   Look, eventually, 
			   everybody gets one...some 
			   of em take a couple 
			   seconds...
				(looking at Jack)
			   ...some of em take a lot 
			   longer...

					JACK
			   I asked you a direct 
			   question!  A glimpse of 
			   what?!

		A look from Cash.

					CASH
			   Figure it out.  You got 
			   plenty of time.

					JACK
			   How much time?!

					CASH
			   As long as it takes to 
			   figure it out.  Which, in 
			   your case, could be 
			   considerable.

					JACK
			   Look, I just want my life 
			   back.  Now whats it 
			   gonna take?  You wanna 
			   talk turkey?  Lets talk 
			   turkey!  How much 
			   money...?

		Cash looks at Jack, relishing the moment.  He flashes 
		Jack a smile.

					CASH
			   Do I look like I need 
			   your money.  It doesnt 
			   work like that and I 
			   cant tell you why.

					JACK
			   Why not?

					CASH
			   Because you got to figure 
			   it out for yourself.
				(beat)
			   Are you listening to me?

					JACK
			   Figure it out?  Figure 
			   what out?!

		Cash just stares at him...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats it?  Thats all I 
			   get?!  A glare?!

					CASH
			   Look Jack, in my 
			   experience the best way 
			   people deal with this is 
			   to just relax and breathe 
			   through it...let it come 
			   to you.

		Jack faces Cash, simmering...with frustration.

					JACK
			   Look, I dont have time 
			   for this right now.  Im 
			   in the middle of a 
			   deal...
					CASH
			   Oh youre working on a 
			   new deal now...did I
			   mention that?

					JACK
			   You know what?  Ive had 
			   it with you.  Ive had it 
			   with all of this shit...

		SCREECH...Cash slams on the brakes...practically 
		sending Jack through the windshield.

		Jack recovers, looks up...the car is parked right next 
		to the mini-van.

		Cash pulls out a small plastic bag, holding it out to 
		Jack...

					CASH
			   Here...

		Jack looks inside the bag, pulls out a BARBIE BICYCLE 
		BELL.  He looks at it curiously.

					JACK
			   Whats this, a signal?  
			   Will you come whenever I 
			   ring it?

					CASH
			   Do I look like I live in 
			   a bottle?

		Cash reaches across Jack and opens the door.

					JACK
				(lost)
			   But what do I do?

					CASH
			   Look Jack Im late.  Id 
			   love to help you out some 
			   more but I gotta go 
			   handle my business...
				(gesturing to 
				 the mini-van)
			   Happy trails.

		Jack looks out to the lonely street outside, then back 
		to Cash.

					JACK
			   Hey, you did this to me, 
			   you cant just leave me 
			   like this.

		Cash looks at Jack, the desperation on his face.

					CASH
			   Fine.  You want to know 
			   everything, Ill tell you 
			   everything.  But not 
			   here.  Lets get some 
			   air...

		Jacks still a little unsure...he sees Cash open the 
		driver side door...

					JACK
				(relieved)
			   Thanks, man...

		Jack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn 
		around, Cashs door SLAMS shut and the car takes off in 
		a blast of horsepower...

		Jack stands there gazing down the street, listening to 
		the sound of the Ferrari shifting gears, 
		disappearing...

		The wind whips up...shivering, Jack looks toward the 
		Lassiter Building, then to the plastic bag in his hand, 
		and finally to the mini-van.

    34	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE MORNING

		The blue mini-van snakes through the curved streets of 
		the neighborhood, almost all the houses decorated for 
		Christmas.

    35	INT. MINI-VAN - SAME TIME

		Jacks trying to find the house, a map unfolded on the 
		steering wheel and the cars registration in his 
		hand...

		He spots ARNIE BENDER, late 30s, carrying an empty 
		science kit box to the trash.  His wife, JEANNIE, also 
		late 30s, is getting in a Ford Taurus wagon, a bowl of 
		fruit in hand...

		Jack pulls up to the curb near Arnie, rolling down the 
		window.

					JACK
			   Excuse me.  Do you know 
			   where Merrison Street is?

		Arnie looks up and sees Jack in the van.

					ARNIE
				(turning to his wife)
			   Jeannie!  I found Jack!

    36	INT. BENDER HOUSE, DEN - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack follows Arnie into the den of this garishly 
		decorated suburban home, Arnies arm around his 
		shoulder.

					ARNIE
			   You look terrible...

		Jack takes in the decor  its a male leisure time 
		fantasy  old pinball machine, wide screen TV, dart 
		board, and kitschy 50s style bamboo bar...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Truth is I expected you.  
			   Kate called before and 
			   asked if I knew where you 
			   were.

		Arnie notices Jacks fascination with the room...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   I know, I moved the 
			   Barca-lounger into the 
			   corner.  Its throwin 
			   everybody off.  What do 
			   you think?

					JACK
				(with a nod)
			   Great room...

		A satisfied smile from Arnie, Jacks approval means 
		something to him.

					ARNIE
			   You and me, buddy.  We 
			   know how to live...

		Arnie shepherds Jack onto a bar stool and pours a drink 
		out of a bamboo bottle holder.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   So Jack, you okay?

		Jack doesnt respond, his eyes drawn to a softball team 
		photo on the bar...Jack and Arnie kissing a huge trophy 
		with the caption, Plainfield, N.J. Softball League 
		Champs, 1994.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   I mean you leave the 
			   house on Christmas 
			   morning, you dont tell 
			   anyone where youre 
			   going...

		Jack looks over from the photo to Arnie...

					JACK
			   Were friends, arent we?

					ARNIE
			   Maybe I dont say it 
			   enough but you moving in 
			   next door to me...

		Arnie makes a fist and gestures to his heart.  Jack 
		nods.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Talk to me...

		A moment of decision for Jack as Arnie stands there, 
		open eyed, ready to listen.

					JACK
			   Im having kind of a bad 
			   day.

					ARNIE
				(nodding)
			   I read somewhere that the 
			   suicide rate doubles 
			   during the holidays...

		A raised eyebrow from Jack.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(to himself)
			   What am I saying?  You 
			   dont need to hear 
			   that...
				(back to Jack)
			   All I meant was a lot of 
			   people have a hard time 
			   dealing with all the 
			   forced reverie, thats 
			   all.  Is that you?

					JACK
			   Is it...?

					ARNIE
			   Trouble at work?

					JACK
			   I dont think so.

					ARNIE
			   Its not Kate, is it?

		Jack pauses at the mention of Kate.  Arnies eyes 
		widen...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(proudly)
			   You see, its like were 
			   in each others heads...

					JACK
			   Kates my wife...

		Jack looks at Arnie as if hes seeking confirmation.

					ARNIE
				(a playful smile) 
			   Just keep saying it, 
			   Jack, like a mantra.

		Arnie comes out from behind the bar, taking Jack by the 
		arm.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Cmon, I better walk ya 
			   home.  Shes mad enough 
			   as it is, right...?

    37	EXT. ARNIES YARD - SECONDS LATER

		Arnie walks Jack through his backyard...

					ARNIE
			   Look, you fit the profile 
			   exactly.  Thirties, 
			   house, kids, financial 
			   responsibilities.  You 
			   start thinking...this 
			   isnt the life I dreamt 
			   about.  Wheres the 
			   romance, wheres the joie 
			   de vivre?  Suddenly, 
			   every lingerie ad in the 
			   Newark Star Ledger 
			   represents a life you 
			   cant have...

					JACK
				(thinking, then...)
			   Its just two kids, 
			   right?

		A chuckle from Arnie.

					ARNIE
			   You made a choice, Jack, 
			   a promise to your wife. 
			   Maybe sometimes it seems 
			   like you gave up the 
			   world, but look what you 
			   got...

		They arrive at...the backyard of the Campbell house... 
		cluttered with a swing set, a dog run with chewed up 
		lawn, and a wooden sun deck in the process of being 
		built...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Four bedrooms, two and a 
			   half baths, and a 
			   partially finished 
			   basement...

		Jack trips over a wayward BIG WHEEL.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
				(shaking his head)
			   Kids...

		Arnie leads Jack toward the house.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Okay look, you probably 
			   dont want to hear this 
			   right now but remember
			   what you told me last 
			   summer when I almost had 
			   that thing with Arnie 
			   Jr.s speech therapist.

		A blank stare from Jack as they arrive at the sliding 
		glass door...Arnie faces Jack squarely, grabbing his 
		shoulders and looking him in the eye.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Dont screw up the best 
			   thing in your life just 
			   because youre a little 
			   unsure about who you 
			   are.  Okay?

		Arnie gives Jack a comforting smie...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   God, it feels so good to 
			   finally give something 
			   back to you...

		Arnie turns Jack toward the door and slides it open.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			   Im gonna hug you now...

		Arnie gives Jack a gentle hug...then gives him a little 
		push toward the door...

    38	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - CONTINUOUS

		Jack steps inside.  He turns back to the door but 
		Arnies gone.

		Then, Kate enters the room, holding a portable phone...

					KATE
				(into phone)
			   Hold on a second...

		She cups the receiver.  Jack looks at her, shes 
		dressed now, nothing fancy but she looks great.

					JACK
			   You cut your hair...

		A curious look from Kate.

					KATE
			   Ten years ago...

		Kate just stands there looking at Jack, giving away 
		nothing.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Are you okay?

					JACK
			   Yeah...fine.

		She gives him a resolute nod, then...

					KATE
				(into phone)
			   Never mind, he just 
			   walked in...

		Jack grimaces as she resolutely hangs up the phone then 
		stares him down angrily.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Do you have any idea what 
			   you put us through 
			   today?!  You walk out of 
			   here at 7:30 in the 
			   morning, dont tell me 
			   where youre going, or 
			   even that youre going, 
			   and I dont see you til 
			   hours later.  I had state 
			   troopers looking for 
			   you!  I called 
			   hospitals...
				(pointing at 
				 the phone)
			   ...I was just on the 
			   phone with the morgue 
			   for gods sake!

		Jack watches her vent, the frustration on his face 
		building.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   What kind of man leaves 
			   his family on Christmas 
			   morning without a word 
			   about where hes going?

		Jacks almost to a breaking po	INT.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   What kind of man does 
			   that!?

					JACK
				(jumping in)
			   I dont know!  Please 
			   stop yelling at me!

		She looks at him curiously.

					KATE
			   Where were you?

					JACK
			   I was in the city.

					KATE
			   The city?  New York 
			   City?  Why?

					JACK
			   Because thats where I 
			   live.

					KATE
			   Jack...dont even 
			   start...

					JACK
			   Look, you dont 
			   understand.  I woke up 
			   here...and this is very 
			   strange ...this is not my 
			   house...

		A raised eyebrow from Kate.  Jack moves around the 
		room...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(pointing upstairs)
			   Im not Dad....  Kate, 
			   youre not my wife...

		Kate looks him over, assessing, then...

					KATE
			   You know what, Jack?  
			   Its not funny this 
			   time.  Im really angry.

		She stares him down, expecting an answer.  But he has 
		no answer.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(loudly)
			   Jack!

		Jack takes the bell out of the plastic bag that Cash 
		gave him, holds it up in front of her and starts 
		RINGING it furiously.

		Then...Annie rides into the room on her new bike.

					ANNIE
				(re: bell)
			   Whats that?

		Jack watches as she pedals over, reaches into his hand 
		and takes the bicycle bell...

					ANNIE (CONTD)
				(examining the bell)
			   I like this...
				(jumping up and 
				 giving hima peck 
				 on the cheek)
			   ...thanks, Dad!

		Annie rides excitedly out of the room on her bike.

		Leaving Jack and Kate alone again...

					KATE
			   You missed the whole 
			   thing, Jack.  The 
			   pancakes, the 
			   presents...you spent six 
			   hours putting that bike 
			   together and you didnt 
			   even get to see the look 
			   on Annies face when she 
			   opened it...

		Jack sees the disappointment on her face...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   You missed Christmas, 
			   Jack.

		Jack looks down, almost ashamed...he relents, giving in 
		to the moment...

					JACK
			   Im...Im sorry.

		Kate looks at him.  He seems sincere enough...

					KATE
			   Look, we dont have time 
			   for this right now, well 
			   talk about it later.  Now 
			   get dressed...
				(pointing to his 
				 outfit)
			   Youre not wearing that 
			   to the Thompsons party.  
			   I dont care how 
			   hilarious you think it 
			   is...

					JACK
			   Party?  Oh no, I cant go 
			   to a party...

					KATE
			   You look forward to this 
			   party all year.  Whats 
			   with you today?

					JACK
			   Trust me on this Kate.  I 
			   really dont think going 
			   to a party is the right 
			   move for me at the 
			   present time.

		Kate looks at him a moment, then shakes her head.

					KATE
			   Fine.  Do whatever you 
			   want.

		She picks up the phone, starts dialing...

					JACK
			   What are you doing?

					KATE
			   Telling my mother she 
			   doesnt have to stay with 
			   the kids.

					JACK
			   Why not?

					KATE
			   Because youll be here.

		Kate just looks at him.

					JACK
			   Ill be ready in ten 
			   minutes.

		He walks past her...toward a hallway door, Kate 
		watching him...

		He opens the door...its a closet.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Christ...
				(turning around)
			   Where the hell is the 
			   bathroom?

					KATE
			   Funny, Jack.  Im 
			   laughing on the inside.

    39	INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

		The light comes on...

		Jack walks in, looks in the mirror, determined to 
		collect himself...but somethings not right...

		He glances around...the bathroom is small and its 
		cluttered with Kates razors, loofah, skin creams...

		...none of this stuff is his...

		...he looks in the mirror again, his face revealing a 
		forlorn sense of displacement...

		...he stares at himself until...he starts to lose it... 
		anger, confusion...sadness...finally, he begins breaking down...

		After a moment, he turns on the water, rinsing his 
		face...

    40	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack at the closet door, looking at a row of Hagar 
		slacks, Docker sport coats and imitation leather 
		shoes...

		He reaches in and touches the fabric on one of the 
		sport coats.

					JACK
			   This is just...
				(searching for 
				 the words)
			   ...this is sub-par...

		Annie appears at the bedroom door, watching Jack at the 
		closet.

		He turns...sees Annie watching him...a look 
		exchanged... then, Annie runs away...

		Jack turns back to the closet and mournfully takes a 
		pair of the slacks...

    41	EXT. THOMPSON HOUSE - NIGHT

		Jack and Kate, a casserole dish in her hand, walk up 
		the path to this tacky but large house, its outside 
		decorated with the most garish display of Christmas 
		decorations this side of Pasaic.

		Kate RINGS the doorbell...

		EVELYN THOMPSON, 30s, wearing a dress thats a bit too 
		tight and a bit too low cut, opens the door...

					EVELYN
			   Kate!  Jack!
				(turning around, 
				 to guests)
			   Everybody, Jack and Kate 
			   are here!

		Jack looks right past her...to the house filled with 50 
		GUESTS.

		A loud WHOOP from the guests...Jack has the look of a 
		condemned man on his face as he follows Kate inside...

    41A	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

		As Kate heads into the living room, Evelyn takes Jacks 
		arm...

					EVELYN
				(suggestively)
			   Like the dress...?

					JACK
				(glancing at it)
				 Its lovely...

					EVELYN
				(a satisfied smile)
			   I thought I saw you 
			   notice it at the kids 
			   recital.

		Jack shoots her a confused look...then walks in, trying 
		to catch up with Kate...

    42	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

		The party is in full swing, Christmas music in the 
		b.g., GUESTS talking, laughing, drinking egg nog...

		Jacks eyes dart around the room...its large, neater 
		than his and Kates house but still very lived in...The 
		Thompson KIDS run in and out of the room, playing with 
		new toys... nobody is wearing or eating anything 
		imported from Europe, but everyones having a good 
		time...

		...everyone except for Jack, standing with Arnie and 
		THE GUYS, having his ear chewed off by NICK CARELLI, a 
		walking advertisement for Levis Cotton Dockers...

					NICK
			   Did you see Van Horn last 
			   night?  This kids gonna 
			   single-handedly save 
			   basketball in the state 
			   of New Jersey...

					JACK
			   The Nets?  Youre kidding, 
			   right...?

		Nick looks at him in disbelief.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(recovering)
			   Well...theyre certainly 
			   due.

		BILL KRAMER, a huge pile of fried chicken wings on his 
		plate, tugs at Jacks shirt.

					BILL KRAMER
			   So tomorrows the big 
			   day, Jackie...

					JACK
			   Okay...why?

					BILL KRAMER
			   Triple bypass.  Im going 
			   under the knife.  I told 
			   you, didnt I?

					JACK
			   Triple bypass?
				(pointing to his 
				 plate)
			   You really think you 
			   should be eating all 
			   that?

					BILL KRAMER
			   Why not?  I figure Im 
			   going in for a cleaning 
			   tomorrow, I might as well 
			   load up on the fried 
			   stuff tonight...

					ARNIE
			   Good thinking, Bill.  
			   Have another drink.
				(whispering to Jack)
			   Hell be lucky if he 
			   lives through the 
			   night...

		Nick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of 
		Dutch Masters cigars.  He shows them to Jack, Jack nods 
		politely.  Nick eagerly hands him one...

		Nick lights Jacks cigar, then his own...enjoying that 
		first puff...smiling at Jack...Jack dutifully takes a 
		puff of the cigar...nods back at Nick...but its an 
		effort...

		Evelyn Thompson approaches, a tray of MUSHROOM PUFFS in 
		hand...

					EVELYN
				(holding out a 
				 puff to Jack)
			   Finger food...?

					JACK
			   I dont think so, thank 
			   you...

					EVELYN
				(suggestively)
			   Cmon, as soon as I put 
			   them down, youre gonna 
			   grab a couple...you 
			   always do...

		Kate sees Evelyn and Jack from her position on the 
		other side of the room...Kate watches as...

		Evelyn holds the puff up to Jacks mouth, slowly 
		putting it near his lips...

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			   Let me.  Theyll melt in 
			   your mouth...

		He instinctively opens his mouth as Evelyn pushes the 
		treat inside...

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			   Good?

		On Jacks face...if freezer burn were a facial 
		expression, this would be it...

					JACK
				(forcing a smile) 
			   Theyre great!  Thank 
			   you!

		...Evelyn licks her fingers suggestively then hands 
		Jack the entire tray with a sexy smile...

		A raised eyebrow from Kate, still watching...

					EVELYN
			   Mushroom puffs arent the 
			   only thing I do well...

					JACK
			   Well do whatever it is 
			   you do well, and 
			   just...just do it.  
			   Excuse me...

		Evelyn nods as Jack walks toward the staircase...

		Kate follows Jack with her eyes as he climbs the 
		stairs...

    43	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, DEN - NIGHT

		Jack is sitting on the arm of a couch filled with 
		guests coats, talking on a FOOTBALL SHAPED 
		telephone...the tray of mushroom puffs on the table...

					JACK
				(loudly, into phone)
			   ...what do you mean he 
			   wont come to the phone?!
				(standing, indignant)
			   Do you realize how much 
			   money Ive made for that 
			   sonuvabitch in the last 
			   eight years?!

		Click.  A dial tone.  Jack slams the phone down...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Damnit!

		He slams the phone again...and again...and again...

					KATE (O.S.)
			   Jack...?

		Jack turns, sees Kate standing in the doorway, watching 
		him take his frustrations out on the phone, concern on 
		her face.

					KATE
			   Are you sure youre 
			   okay...?

		A forced smile from Jack.

					JACK
			   Yes, Im fine.  Its just 
			   this god awful football 
			   phone!  Who has a phone 
			   like this anyway?!

					KATE
				(doubtful)  
			   Uh huh...

		Kate notices the tray of mushroom puffs on the table.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   You must really love 
			   Evelyns mushroom puffs, 
			   huh?
				(with a wink)
			   You know theyre not 
			   real...

		She turns and leaves...Jack looks at her, confused...

    44	INT. THOMPSON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack comes down the stairs, a lost look in his eyes.  
		He looks across the room and sees...

		Kate, with a group of GUESTS, looking great in her 
		jeans and white blouse, the center of attention.

		Jack passes through the guests, people waving to him, 
		slapping him on the back as he approaches Kate...

		He catches Kates eye...she gives him a subtle smile.

					KATE
				(to guests)
			   ...then she asks me to 
			   put this sweater on.  
			   What choice do I have, 
			   right?

		Jack watches as Kate charms the crowd...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   But as Im slipping it on 
			   I notice shes misspelled 
			   the word lawyers.
				(laughing)
			   I had to go through the 
			   entire day wearing a hand 
			   embroidered sweater that 
			   said, Non-Profit Layers 
			   Do It For Free.

		The guests laugh again.  Even Jack finds himself 
		laughing, until...

					JACK
				(to Kate, off-hand)
			   So youre a lawyer...?

		A chuckle from the group.  Kates confused.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   A non-profit lawyer...

		People are starting to LAUGH.

					KATE
				(a little embarrassed)
			   Jack...

					JACK
			   Pro bono.  You dont get 
			   paid at all.  Nobody 
			   makes a dime.  Well, 
			   bravo...

		Blank stares from everyone, including Kate...

		CUT TO:

    45	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, FOYER - LATE NIGHT

		Kate and Jack walk in the front door...the dog greets 
		them happily, jumping up on Jack, a weary look on his 
		face.

					KATE
			   I better go wake my
			   mother...

		Kate grabs a leash off a hook and hands it to Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Here you go...

					JACK
			   Youre kidding me...

					KATE
			   Shes your dog, Jack.

					JACK
			   No, shes not.

					KATE
			   Fine, shes the kids 
			   dog.  Lets go wake Josh, 
			   see if he wants to walk 
			   her.

					JACK
			   But its twenty degrees 
			   outside...

					KATE
				(sympathetic)
			   Youre having a bad day, 
			   Ill go with 
			   you...actually, theres 
			   no way in hell youre 
			   gettin me back out 
			   there...

		Jack looks at the dogs face.  Lucy couldnt be more 
		excited.  Finally, Jack shakes his head and takes the 
		leash.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(heading up the 
				 stairs)
			   Make sure you reward her 
			   verbally when she does a 
			   number two...

		CUT TO:

    46	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

		The sound of CRICKETS.

		Jack, wearing a down jacket, is being dragged down the 
		street by Lucy, his breath condensing in the cold 
		winter air.  The dog sniffs at a hydrant and a couple 
		of garbage cans, but isnt doing her business.

					JACK
			   Figure it out...Im s
			   crewed...dont have to 
			   be a genius to figure 
			   that out...

		The dog stops, sniffing at a manicured lawn...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Lucy)
			   Its as good a place as 
			   any...

		But the dog keeps moving, pulling Jack with her.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   ...but obviously not up 
			   to your high standards...
				(to himself)
			   Okay...he said youre 
			   working on a new deal 
			   now...fine, youve done a 
			   thousand deals, whats 
			   the first thing you do?

		Lucys sniffing around someones Christmas display but 
		Jacks too wrapped up in his thought process to notice.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Triage.  Its your 
			   signature.  You survey 
			   the damage, find out 
			   everything you can, you 
			   probe, leave nothing to 
			   chance.  Im just gonna 
			   have to go detective.  
			   How did you get 
			   Mentadent?  You learned 
			   everything there was to 
			   know about toothpaste and 
			   then you pounced...

		Jack narrows his eyes, thinking about that deal...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats our play here...

		Resolute, Jack turns to the dog.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   If you could take a dump 
			   some time in this 
			   century, then we could go 
			   home where its warm...

		Jack looks around at the unfamiliar houses...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   That is if I can even 
			   remember how to get 
			   home...
				(to Lucy)
			   You remember, dont you 
			   girl?

		But the dog ignores him, dragging Jack along...

    47	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Kate is in bed, fast asleep.

		Jack walks into the room, his face still red from the 
		cold outside.  He looks over at Kate, sleeping happily.

		He takes off his shirt and khakis, laying them neatly 
		on the chair.  He looks over at the pair of flannel 
		pajamas folded on the dresser.  He shakes his head, 
		resigned, then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed...

		CHAPTER SIX - BEING A PARENT
	
    48	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

		Morning light streams into the room.  The clock reads, 
		7:14.

		Jack opens his eyes  a burst of light hitting them 
		from the window...like the morning light in his 
		Manhattan loft...

		He reaches across the bed...its empty...

		A smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on 
		the pillow...maybe it was only a day...Then...

		The sound of a baby CRYING from the next room...A 
		pained look on Jacks face as he realizes hes still in 
		Jersey.

		Now the baby is WAILING...Jack lies still a moment, 
		hoping itll stop...it doesnt.  Then, he hears the 
		sound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom.

		He gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom...

    49	INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

		The shower is running, a tape player is BLASTING Beast 
		of Burden.  Kate is in the shower SINGING LOUDLY with 
		the song...

					JACK
			   Hello?

		No answer...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(louder, over music)
			   Hello!

					KATE
				(singing)
			   ...my feet are hurtin...

					JACK
				(yelling)
			   HEY!

		Finally, the music is turned down and Kate pulls the 
		shower curtain open...

		Jack sees her naked body...raises an eyebrow...thats 
		something hes missed...then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Uh...that babys crying...

					KATE
				(unimpressed)
			   And...?

		...her expression makes Jack turn his gaze from her 
		naked body.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Dont give me that look, 
			   Jack, Tuesdays your day 
			   and you know it.  And try 
			   to get Josh to day care 
			   on time, okay?  He missed 
			   the macaroni painting 
			   last week...

		She closes the curtain and turns the radio back up.

		CUT TO:

    50	INT. JOSHS ROOM - MORNING

		Annies watching from a baby-size Laz-E-Boy lounger 
		as...

		Jack, in a robe, stands in front of a changing table, 
		Josh laying happily on his back, playing with a set of 
		plastic keys.

		Jack takes a fresh Huggies diaper and puts it next to 
		the baby.  He surveys Josh, scratching his chin and 
		rubbing his hands like Indiana Jones.  Josh playfully 
		grabs at Jacks nose.

		He looks over to Annie.  Shes still staring at him 
		like hes a Martian.  He looks at the instructions on 
		the box of Huggies.

					JACK
			   Pull tape...

		Jack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape, then 
		gingerly pulls them apart, releasing the diaper from 
		the babys bottom, and seeing whats inside.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Holy mother of god!

		Jack holds the diaper out away from him, searching for 
		a place to put it.  Annie points to a Diaper Genie by 
		the dresser.

		Jack throws the diaper in, then quickly replaces the 
		lid.  Annie points to the container of Baby Wipes.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   You must be kidding...

		Annie stares at him a beat.  Then...

					ANNIE
			   Youre not really our 
			   dad, are you?

		Jack turns to her.  Shes looking back at him with 
		complete earnestness.  They stare at each other another 
		moment.  Then...

					JACK
			   No, Im not.

		A look of curiosity from Annie.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   I work on Wall Street, 
			   you know with the big 
			   buildings...?

		No response from Annie...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   I live in an apartment 
			   house with a doorman, I 
			   can buy just about 
			   anything I want...

		Annie nods at Jack, still suspicious.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   This isnt my real life.  
			   Its just a glimpse...

					ANNIE
			   Wheres my real dad?

					JACK
			   I dont know...

		A concerned look on Annies face, Jacks petrified that 
		shes about to cry.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   But dont worry, he loves 
			   you and Im sure hell be 
			   back very soon...
				(to himself)
			   ...very, very soon...

		Annie approaches Jack, climbing up on a little chair 
		and tugging firmly at his hair.

					ANNIE
			   They did a pretty good 
			   job.

					JACK
			   Who did?

					ANNIE
			   The aliens...In the 
			   mother ship.  You look 
			   just like him.

					JACK
			   Uhh...thanks...slightly 
			   better looking though, 
			   right?

		Annies now stone faced, trying to decide about Jack.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Youre not going to start 
			   crying, are you?  Because 
			   Im not really sure I 
			   could deal with that 
			   right now.

		She thinks about it for a moment.

					ANNIE
			   Do you like kids?

					JACK
			   On a case by case 
			   basis...

					ANNIE
			   You know how to make 
			   chocolate milk?

					JACK
			   I think I could figure it 
			   out.

					ANNIE
			   You promise not to kidnap 
			   me and my brother and 
			   implant stuff in our brains?

					JACK
			   Sure.

		Beat.  Then...a smile from Annie.

					ANNIE
			   Welcome to earth.

    51	INT. MINI-VAN - MORNING

		Jacks driving, Annie buckled in the front seat...

		Josh, in the baby seat, looks like he was dressed by 
		monkeys  his shirt buttons are off by one, and theyre 
		clearly supposed to be in the back.

					ANNIE
			   Stop here...

		Jack stops the van outside the Playland Day Care 
		Center.

					ANNIE (CONTD)
			   This is day care.  Its 
			   where babies go when 
			   their parents are at 
			   work.

					JACK
			   Check...

		He gets out of the van...

    52	EXT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

		...he pulls Josh out and walks quickly toward the 
		building, holding the baby away from his body.

		He gets to the door and holds Josh out to the DAY CARE 
		LADY.  She stares at Joshs outfit...

					JACK
			   Do I get a receipt or 
			   something...?

		The woman looks at Jack like hes crazy.

    53	EXT. YMCA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

		The mini-van pulls up to the drop-off point at this 
		suburban New Jersey Y.  Annie opens the door.

					ANNIE
			   I have winter camp until 
			   four, then ballet until 
			   five thirty.

					JACK
			   Five thirty.  Okay.

					ANNIE
			   Try not to be late 
			   because kids dont like 
			   to be the last one picked 
			   up.

					JACK
			   Got it.  Good tip.

					ANNIE
			   Bye...

		CHAPTER SEVEN - A TIRE SALESMAN

		Jack watches her as she runs toward the building.  
		Then...

					JACK
				(calling out window)
			   Hey!  Annie!

		Annie turns back toward him.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Where do I go now?

					ANNIE
			   Big Eds.

					JACK
			   Big Eds?  Big Eds 
			   Tires?
				(suspicious)
			   Why...?

					ANNIE
			   Thats where you work.

		A beat.  Then...

					JACK
			   You mean I sell tires...

		She shrugs her shoulders and walks off.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Thats what I do.  Im a 
			   tire salesman...

		CUT TO:

    54	INT. MINI-VAN - A LITTLE LATER

		Jacks driving down a busy commercial street when he 
		spots something a hundred yards down the road...

					JACK
			   Good Lord...

		...a huge, three-story-tall plastic likeness of Big Ed 
		Reynolds, ten gallon hat, lassoing a tire...

    55	EXT. BIG EDS TIRES - MOMENTS LATER

		Jack approaches Big Eds from the parking lot...slowly, 
		taking it all in...

		Its like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme.  A big retail 
		store for tires and auto parts, and a repair bay for 
		everything from alignments to brake jobs...

		Jack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR, 40s, a 
		Guatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls, stands 
		with TOMMY the salesman.

					TOMMY
			   Hey Jack, you happen to 
			   know the stock number on 
			   those new Michelin X1's?

					JACK
			   Uh...lemme get back to 
			   you on that one...
				(looking at his 
				 name tag)
			   Tommy...

					HECTOR
				(to Tommy)
			   Thomas, why you bother 
			   Jack about that.  Look it 
			   up yourself...
				(to Jack)
			   Okay Jack, we talk 
			   later...

		Jack nods amiably then continues into the store...

    56	INT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		Jack walks in...looks around...the store is teeming 
		with activity, a post-holiday sale in progress...

		Big Ed, in his signature ten gallon hat, sees Jack from 
		behind the counter...

					BIG ED
			   Jack my boy!  You are 
			   looking mighty worse for 
			   the wear...Hey, guess who
			   I played bridge with two 
			   nights ago...?

		Jack stares blankly at Big Ed...

					BIG ED (CONTD) 
			   Hell, youll never 
			   guess.  One Sydney 
			   Potter.  Thats Sydney 
			   Potter, Chief Executive 
			   Officer of BuyRite 
			   Transport.  Only the 
			   third largest trucking 
			   company in the state.  I 
			   even let the sonuvabitch 
			   win, which wasnt easy 
			   because the guys been 
			   bashed in the head by 
			   Teamsters so many times 
			   his brains like 
			   porridge.  Anyhoo, hes 
			   looking for a new parts 
			   supplier... we can handle 
			   that kind of volume, 
			   right?

		Jack considers this briefly.

					JACK
			   Im gonna have to get 
			   back to you on that...Ed.

		Big Ed makes a gun gesture with his forefinger, winking 
		at Jack, then turns back to the activity at the counter 
		as...

		Jack spots KENNY, a very young sales associate, walking 
		by.  He reaches out and taps Kenny on the shoulder.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Do I have a private 
			   office somewhere in the 
			   building?

					KENNY
			   Uh...sure Jack...
				(nervously pointing)
			   Right back there...

					JACK
			   Thank you.

		Jack walks into the office with his name on the door...

    57	INT. JACKS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Theres no Stairmaster here, no leather sofa or 
		bar...its small, cramped and cluttered, the walls 
		littered with tire inventory and price lists...

		Jack takes a slow, sad lap around the office.

		He makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of 
		the room and sits down behind it...

		On the desk are photos of Jack, Kate and the kids, a 
		plastic Michelin Man model, a tire-themed day calendar 
		and a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER, the word, 
		Bowlers Do It In An Alley embossed on its base...

		He surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top 
		drawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking 
		inside...

		He sees the bottom line and winces, then puts it 
		back...

		Jack picks up the Bowlers Do It In An Alley figurine 
		and gives it a good look...

					JACK
			   Bowlers do it in an 
			   alley?...Non profit 
			   lawyers do it for free... 
			   what is it with these 
			   people?  Dont they 
			   realize this refers to 
			   sex?

		He replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer 
		where he spots a bottle of Glenfiddich.  He lifts it 
		out...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   At least you splurged on 
			   some decent scotch...

		He takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot.  He 
		drinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the 
		cup, throwing it toward the NETS basketball 
		hoop/garbage can near the door.

		He misses...

		He looks more closely at the photographs...most are 
		family photos, a happy Jack with Kate, with Annie at 
		the pony rides, at Joshs birth...in every one of them, 
		Jack is smiling...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Jack in 
				 the photo)
			   What are you smiling 
			   about...?

		He turns his head...spots a small plaque on the wall 
		behind him.  It reads, Jack Campbell - E.F. Hutton #1 
		Junior Sales Associate, 1988.  Jack raises an 
		eyebrow...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Number one...not bad.

		He grabs it off the wall and looks at it more 
		carefully...

					JACK (CONTD)

			   1988...?  I was in London 
			   in 1988...

		Jacks jarred into reality...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(to Jack in the photo)
			   You never went to London...
				(picking up the photo)
			   ...you never got on that 
			   plane...

		He stays there a moment...in shock.  Then...

		The P.A. system comes to life...

					ESTELLE
				(over P.A.)
			   Jack to mag 
			   wheels...Jack, youre 
			   needed in mag wheels, 
			   customer waiting!

		CUT TO:

    58	INT. BIG EDS TIRES, MAIN FLOOR - MINUTES LATER

		Kenny leading Jack toward the Mag Wheels section.

					JACK
			   ...I was the number one 
			   junior sales associate at 
			   E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did 
			   you know that?

					KENNY
			   No, I didnt...thats 
			   great.

					JACK
			   Thats the kind of thing 
			   you can really build 
			   on...

					KENNY
			   Uh huh...

					JACK
			   I mean sales has always 
			   been a feeder for M and 
			   A, always...

		They approach Mag Wheels where TOMMY, a slick sales 
		associate, stands with a CUSTOMER looking at the 
		displays...

					KENNY
			   Here we are, mag wheels...
				(a little concerned)
			   Hey Jack, are you sure 
			   youre okay?

					JACK
			   Well, Im just a little 
			   confused right now about 
			   why I work here...

		Kenny looks at him nervously.

					KENNY
			   Uh...I just started here 
			   last Tuesday.

		Jack nods compassionately.  Kenny takes off leaving 
		Jack alone with his thoughts as Tommy approaches with 
		the customer.

					TOMMY
				(to the customer)
			   So youre all set on the 
			   Skip Shift eliminator and 
			   the Brembo rotors.  
			   Jacks our point man on 
			   alloy wheels...

					JACK
				(turning to Tommy)
			   Do you know why do I work 
			   here...?

					TOMMY
			   Because youre the best 
			   damn tire guy in the 
			   state of New Jersey...
				(proudly, to the 
				 customer)
			   Jack taught me everything 
			   I know about the 
			   business...

		The customer nods, impressed.

					JACK
			   I taught you the business?

		Another nod to the customer.

					TOMMY
			   And hes a crack-up.

					JACK
			   Everything I taught you.  
			   I want to hear it all, 
			   right now.

		Tommys confused.

					CUSTOMER
			   Hey, Im ready to buy 
			   here...

					JACK
				(to the customer)
			   What do you want?

					CUSTOMER
			   I want some alloy wheels.

		Jack grabs one of the alloy rims off the shelf, holding 
		it out to the customer.

					JACK
			   Here.  These are great.  
			   Youll need four.

		The customer takes the wheel from Jack, looks at it 
		confused...

					CUSTOMER
			   But I dont like these...

					JACK
			   Hey, you heard the guy, 
			   Im the best damn tire 
			   guy in the state of New 
			   Jersey.
				(turning to Tommy)
			   Everything.

					TOMMY
			   Okay...
				(hesitating)
			   Rule number one, the 
			   customer is always 
			   right...

		A satisfied smirk from the customer.

    59	INT. BIG EDS TIRES, JACKS OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

		Jack is behind his desk, his tie loosened, on the 
		phone...

					JACK
				(into phone)
			   ...I have no idea what 
			   our inventory level is, 
			   thats why Im asking 
			   you...

		A KNOCK at the door...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Look, just send us what 
			   you sent us last month, 
			   okay...?  And keep doing 
			   that until further 
			   notice...

		He hangs up the phone as the door opens.  Big Ed sticks 
		his head in...

					BIG ED
			   Got a minute, Jack?

					JACK
			   Ive got all the time in 
			   the world...

		Big Ed walks in, followed by SYDNEY POTTER, 60s, a 
		tough looking man...

					BIG ED
			   Jack, meet Sydney Potter, 
			   BuyRite Transport, one of 
			   Jerseys top 
			   businessmen...

		Potter extends a hand, Jack rises from his chair, 
		trying to place the name.  Then...

					JACK
			   ...and a helluva bridge 
			   player.  Eds told me a 
			   lot about you...

		They shake hands.  Potter nods his head at Jack, 
		immediately impressed.  Big Ed is beaming.

					POTTER
				(in a heavy Jersey 
				 accent)
			   Lucky in cards, lucky in 
			   business, lucky in love.  
			   My cup runneth over...
				(to Big Ed)
			   Hes a nice looking 
			   boy...

					BIG ED
			   My daughters no slouch 
			   either...

		A smile from Potter, then a serious look.

					POTTER
			   Lets cut to the chase, 
			   Jack.  Big Ed tells me 
			   youre the grease that 
			   makes the wheels turn 
			   around here.  I need a 
			   new parts supplier for my 
			   fleet.  You seem to have 
			   the parts.  That we 
			   know.  What we dont know 
			   is why the hell I should 
			   buy them from you.

		Potter stares Jack down.  But Jacks not about to be 
		intimidated by him.  He pauses, matching Potters 
		stare.  Then...

					JACK
			   I have no idea...

		A surprised look from Potter.  An anxious laugh from 
		Big Ed.

					BIG ED
				(nervous)
			   Cmon Jack...

					JACK
				(to Potter)
			   I mean it.  From what I 
			   can tell, were a mom and 
			   pop operation, were 
			   already over-extended in 
			   sales, and any price 
			   advantage we could offer 
			   would easily be matched 
			   by a larger supplier...

		Jack continues to stare down Potter.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   So like I said, I dont 
			   have any idea why you 
			   should buy your parts 
			   from us...

		The staring match continues.  Big Eds getting more 
		nervous.  Potters the first to blink.

					POTTER
			   Okay, you got my 
			   attention...

					JACK
			   Except for rule number 
			   one...

		Jack smiles.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   The customer is always 
			   right.  A cliché?  Sure. 
			   The difference is, we 
			   mean it.  Were small, we 
			   need our customers.  We 
			   cant afford to 
			   disappoint them, ever. 
			   Yeah, you could go to 
			   some leviathan supplier, 
			   probably save a few 
			   pennies on the price of 
			   oil filters, but with us 
			   you get more than a 
			   supplier, you get a 
			   bridge partner...

		A smile from Potter.  Jack gives Ed a wink.  Ed 
		watches, thrilled...

					JACK (CONTD)
			   You want to bid hearts, 
			   were right there with 
			   you.  You feel the need 
			   to redouble, youre not 
			   going to get any argument 
			   from us...

		Potter nods at Jack.  Jack moves in for the kill.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   The big guys may have the 
			   high cards, but you know 
			   as well as I do, Sydney, 
			   high cards dont always 
			   take the trick.

		Potter pauses a minute, then...

					POTTER
				(to Big Ed, 
				 re: Jack)
			   I like him...

		Big Ed smiles, letting out a relieved sigh.

					BIG ED
				(a wink to Jack)
			   Thats my boy...
				(an arm around Potter)
			   Cmon, lemme show you the 
			   rest of the ranch...

		Big Ed and Potter exit the office...

					BIG ED (CONTD)
				(turning back to Jack)
			   Nice shootin, Jack...

		...leaving Jack there with a satisfied smile on his 
		face.

    60	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

		Jack is in bed watching CNBC...On the TV a young woman 
		REPORTER at the anchors desk...

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   ...advancers led 
			   decliners by a nine to 
			   four ratio and the 
			   closing tick was a mildly 
			   bullish plus seventy 
			   six.  Much of the 
			   markets action today was 
			   fueled by the latest 
			   round of merger mania to 
			   hit Wall Street...

		The Global Health Systems and MedTech logos appear on a 
		graphic in the corner of the screen...

					CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
			   ...when Global Health 
			   Systems and MedTech 
			   Pharmaceutical announced 
			   their intentions to join 
			   forces in a massive one 
			   hundred and twenty two 
			   billion dollar stock swap 
			   deal.  Though neither 
			   side expressed 
			   significant regulatory 
			   concerns at the 
			   announcement press 
			   conference, it is 
			   believed that both the 
			   FDA and the FTC will be 
			   closely scrutinizing the 
			   marriage, the largest 
			   ever in the health care 
			   industry.  When asked 
			   about possible anti-
			   competitive implications, 
			   Global Chairman Bob 
			   Thomas referred reporters 
			   to P.K. Lassiter and 
			   Company President Alan 
			   Mintz, the original 
			   architect behind the 
			   deal...

		Jack stares in shock as the image changes to a super 
		confident looking Mintz shaking Bob Thomas hand at the 
		press conference.

					CNBC REPORTER (CONTD, ON T.V.)
			   Ironically, Mintz first 
			   met Thomas at a Lamaze 
			   class...

					JACK
			   A Lamaze class...!?

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   ...while coaching their 
			   pregnant wives, Mintz and T
			   homas struck up a 
			   dialogue about the need 
			   for consolidation in the 
			   rapidly growing health 
			   care industry and two 
			   months later, the deal 
			   with MedTech was born...

					JACK
			   What?!  Thats my deal?

					CNBC REPORTER (ON T.V.)
			   In other business news, 
			   U.S. Labor Department 
			   officials announced today
			   that two hundred and 
			   seventy-five thousand new
			   jobs were created last 
			   month, twenty-five 
			   thousand less than 
			   economists were 
			   predicting, leading to a 
			   mild rally in the bond 
			   markets before midday.  
			   But as the trading 
			   session drew to a close, 
			   the profit takers stepped 
			   in and the long bond 
			   closed at ninety seven 
			   even, up only two ticks, 
			   the yield inching down to 
			   six point zero seven 
			   percent...

		Kate comes into the room from the hallway wearing only 
		Jacks NYU sweatshirt...

					KATE
			   The kids are asleep...

		She goes over to the window and draws the blinds.  Jack 
		looks up at her, nods, then goes back to the TV.

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Jack.  I said the kids 
			   are asleep...

					JACK
				(distracted)
			   Well thats just 
			   great...those little 
			   monkeys can be a real 
			   handful...

		Kate shuts off the TV.

					JACK (CONTD)
			   Hey!  I was watching 
			   that!

					KATE
			   I thought we had a deal 
			   about you watching CNBC 
			   in bed.

					JACK
			   Im working on a new deal 
			   now...

		Kate throws a Kate Bushs The Sensual World into the 
		CD player.

					KATE
			   Fine, but not tonight...

		She climbs onto the bed, a seductive look on her face.

					JACK
			   Wait a second.  You want 
			   me, dont you?

					KATE
			   That is the general idea, 
			   yes...

		Kate starts kissing him...but Jacks a little 
		uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy...he pulls back, 
		a little nervous.

					JACK
			   Shouldnt we grab some 
			   dinner first?  Maybe a 
			   bottle of wine...?

					KATE
			   Its ten thirty, Jack.  
			   By eleven youre gonna be 
			   sprawled out on the bed 
			   snoring your head off.  
			   We dont have time for 
			   wining and dining.

					JACK
			   Whatever you say...honey.

		She starts kissing him again...but this time he just 
		goes with it, and as her hands run through his hair 
		hes brought back to a different time and place...

		Jack momentarily pulls back and looks at her...its 
		like the first time hes really looked at her in eleven 
		years...


					JACK (CONTD)
			   God...youre beautiful...

		She smiles at him, almost uncomfortable with the 
		compliment...

					KATE
			   Thanks, Jack...

					JACK
			   No, Im serious...youre 
			   really stunning...

					KATE
			   This is good stuff, Jack, 
			   keep it coming...

					JACK
			   I mean back in college, 
			   you were a very pretty 
			   girl, theres no question 
			   about that.  But this...
				(lost in her)
			   ...youve really grown 
			   into a beautiful woman...

		Jack stares at her, entranced...Kate pulls back, 
		reacting to the intensity in his stare...

					KATE
			   How can you do that?

					JACK
				(nervous)
			   Do what?

					KATE
			   Look at me like you 
			   havent seen me every day 
			   for the last twelve 
			   years...

		Jack freezes.  Theres love in her eyes but its not 
		meant for him...

		She kisses him...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   Dont move.

		She gets up off the bed and heads for the bathroom...

		He looks around...not sure what to do...Finally...

		He turns onto his side and closes his eyes...

		Kate emerges from the bathroom, she sees Jack on the 
		bed, hears his breathing heavy with sleep...

		At once charmed and disappointed, Kate sighs.  She 
		turns off the CD player and heads into bed.

		She pulls the covers up over Jack, shutting off the 
		light... She puts an arm around him, kissing him 
		sweetly on the neck...

					KATE (CONTD)
			   night, honey...

		Close in on Jacks face...turned away from Kate...he 
		opens his eyes...looks down at her arm...loneliness on 
		his face...

		CHAPTER EIGHT - THE MENS DEPARTMENT

		DISSOLVE TO:

    61	EXT. MALL - DAY

		Its mid-January and all signs of the Christmas season are 
		gone except for the snow on the ground in the busy parking 
		lot.

    62	INT. MACYS, MENS DEPT. - DAY

		Kate, pushing Josh in the stroller and holding Annies 
		hand, passing through the Mens Dept., Jack lagging 
		behind, a bevy of shopping bags in hand and a 
		beleaguered look on his face.

					KATE
				(back to Jack)
			Were almost done here...

					ANNIE
			Mary Janes, Mom.  You 
			promised.

					KATE
			Thats right.  Okay, 
			lets make a quick stop 
			at the kids shoe 
			department, pick up my 
			watch from the battery 
			place, then Ill run into 
			the linen store...

		An unhappy look on Jacks face.

					JACK
			Why dont we just go to 
			all the stores?!

		Kate looks back at Jack.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Every single store in 
			this godforsaken shopping 
			mall.  We can go to them 
			all.

		Kate gives him a look.  Then...

					KATE
			You know what, Jack?!  
			Ill go with the kids.  
			Why dont you just hang 
			out here in the mens 
			department... okay?

		Jack glances at the Mens Dept., sighs and gives Kate a 
		nod.  She takes off with the kids...and then he sees 
		it...

		...the Zegna section.  Hes drawn to the neat rows of 
		beautiful suits like a moth to the light...

		He approaches the rack, pulls out a dark green suit, 
		gently touching the soft wool.

					SALESMAN (O.S.)
			Its perfect for your 
			frame...

		Jack turns and sees a SALESMAN standing behind him.

					SALESMAN 
			Would you like to try it 
			on?

		CUT TO:

    63	INT. MACYS MENS DEPT. - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack, at a mirror wearing the Zegna suit.  It is 
		perfect for his frame.  The color is spectacular, the 
		line is dazzling.

		Jack looks in the mirror, shutting everything else 
		out... its like hes seeing his old self...

					KATE (O.S.)
			You look amazing in that 
			suit...

		Jack snaps out of his trance.  He sees Kate standing 
		behind him, Annie and Josh happily playing a few feet 
		away.
					KATE
			I mean...wow...off the 
			charts great.

					JACK
			Its an unbelievable 
			thing.  Wearing this suit 
			actually makes me feel 
			like a better person.
				(taking one final 
				 look)
			Im gonna buy it...

		Kate raises an eyebrow, then looks at the price tag.

					KATE
			$2,400?!  Are you out of 
			your mind?

					JACK
				(pointing to Annies 
				 new Mary Janes)
			She got those shoes...

					KATE
			Those shoes were twenty 
			five dollars.  Cmon, 
			take it off.  Well go to 
			the food court and get 
			one of those funnel cakes 
			you like.

		Jack looks at her...its a moment of decision.

					JACK
			No.

		Kate looks at Jack, a little surprised.

					KATE
			No?

					JACK
			Do you have any idea what 
			my life is like?

					KATE
			Excuse me?

					JACK
			I wake up in the morning 
			covered in dog saliva...I 
			drop the kids off, spend 
			eight hours selling tires 
			retail...retail, Kate.

		Kate just stands here, aghast...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I pick up the kids, walk
			the dog, which by the 
			way, carries the added 
			bonus of carting away her
			monstrous crap...I play 
			with the kids, take out 
			the garbage, get six 
			hours of sleep if Im 
			lucky, and then it starts 
			all over again...and why 
			is it that I always have 
			to drive everyone 
			everywhere?  I spend 
			practically my entire day 
			in that slow as hell 
			mini-van listening to 
			Raffi tapes and trying to 
			figure out how the cup 
			holders work...Im sick 
			of it.

					KATE
			Really.

					JACK
			Whats in it for me?  
			Where are my Mary Janes?

		Kate stares at him, shaking her head...

					KATE
			Its sad to hear your 
			life is such a 
			disappointment to you, 
			Jack.

					JACK
			I cant believe its not 
			a disappointment to you!
				(letting it all out)
			Jesus, Kate, I couldve 
			been a thousand times the 
			man I became.  How could 
			you do this to me?  How 
			could you let me give up 
			on my dreams like this?!

		Kate stares at him in disbelief.  Then...

					KATE
			Who are you?

		Kates words pierce Jack...he has to avert his eyes.

					JACK
				(lowering his voice)
			Look, Im sorry.  Im 
			sorry I was such a saint 
			before and Im such a 
			prick now.  Maybe Im 
			just not the same guy I 
			was when we got 
			married...

					KATE
			Maybe youre not.  The 
			Jack Campbell I married 
			wouldnt need a $2400 
			suit to make himself feel 
			better about his life, 
			but if thats what its 
			gonna take, then buy it.  
			Just buy the goddamn 
			suit ...we can take the 
			money out of the kids 
			college fund.

		They stare at each other for a moment...a stand-off...

					JACK
			Forget it...
				(taking off the 
				 jacket)
			Well get a funnel cake.  
			Itll be the highlight of 
			my week...

    64	EXT. NEW JERSEY ROAD - NIGHT

		The blue mini-van makes its way down this road...

    65	INT. MINI-VAN - NIGHT

		Theres an icy silence in the car...Jack is behind the 
		wheel, Kate next to him looking out the window, anger 
		on her face...
 
		CHAPTER NINE - REMINISCING

		Jack checks the rear-view mirror, sees Annie and Josh 
		in the back, both asleep...

					JACK
				(to Kate)
			Listen, Im sorry about 
			that back in the store.  
			I really dont want to 
			fight with you...

		Kate just keeps looking out the window.

					JACK (CONTD)
			But you must sometimes 
			wonder how we ended up 
			here.  I mean back in 
			college, did you see 
			us...
				(looking around)
			...here...?

		She turns to him.

					KATE
			Ill give you this, life 
			has thrown us a few 
			surprises...

		A glimmer in Jacks eye...

					JACK
			It really has, hasnt 
			it?  So if you had 
			to...what would you say 
			was the biggest surprise?

		She glances at the kids sleeping in the back.

					KATE
			Well...Annie for one.

					JACK
			Surprise.  Were 
			pregnant...
				(a laugh)
			Yeah...that mustve 
			been...I mean that was 
			very unexpected.  But 
			what are you gonna do, 
			right?

					KATE
			I think it worked out 
			okay, dont you?

					JACK
			Sure.  I really like 
			Annie.

					KATE
			Good, Jack.  Maybe well 
			keep her.

					JACK
			No, I love Annie.  We had 
			a lot of good times, 
			didnt we?

					KATE
			We were young...
				(a nostalgic smile)
			Remember that little 
			place on Charles Street 
			we used to go to?

					JACK
			Charles Street?  In the 
			Village?  When we were 
			living in Greenwich 
			Village...?
				(off her nod)
			Great times.  Whyd we 
			ever leave?

					KATE
			You cant really raise a 
			kid in an apartment in 
			the Village...

		Jack nods, starting to piece it together.

					KATE (CONTD)
			The trek out to the 
			hospital every day didnt 
			help either...
				(looking at him)
			You were great.  
			Surviving the heart 
			attack was one thing...

					JACK
			You had a heart attack?

					KATE
				(a laugh)
			Jack, stop that. I'm
			still mad at you...
				(a sigh)
			...who knows what 
			wouldve happened if you 
			hadnt stepped in at the 
			store.

					JACK
			Thats why I work for Big 
			Ed?

		A look from Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(recovering)
			I mean, thats why I work 
			for Big Ed...

		Jack looks out at the road a moment, piecing it all 
		together in his mind.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(almost to himself)
			So we had a baby, Big Ed 
			had a heart attack, we b
			ought that house, and 
			Ive been working for him 
			ever since...Sayonara, 
			Wall Street.

		Kate looks at him a little strangely.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(turning to her)
			Our life in a nutshell...

					KATE
			If you want to look at it 
			that way...

					JACK
			How would you look at it?

		She glances again at the kids in the back seat, then at 
		Jack.

					KATE
			A great success story...

		A smile from Jack.  He admires her outlook even if he 
		cant bring himself to share it.

		DISSOLVE TO:

    66	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING

		A crowded suburban New Jersey bowling alley...

		Jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball, the 
		nickname The Hammer emblazoned over his bowling shirt 
		pocket...He approaches the line and throws the ball 
		down the lane...

		Its ugly...The ball caroms off the hardwood into the 
		gutter.

					JACK
			Damn...

					ARNIE
				(O.S., from behind)
			Jesus, Jack, this is a 
			league match, for gods 
			sake!

		Jack turns.  Arnie and the BOWLING TEAM are in the 
		scorekeeping area watching Jack make a mockery of the 
		sport.  Jack scowls.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Wheres your follow 
			through?  Wheres your 
			stance?

					JACK
			Hey, Im doing the best I 
			can...
				(under his breath)
			Id like to see you hit a 
			squash ball after 
			seventeen beers...

					ARNIE
			Youre right.  Why am I 
			so competitive!?  
			Compensation, I guess.  
			Look, just focus, Jack.  
			You can still pick up the 
			spare...

		Jack retrieves his ball, sets up, genuinely 
		concentrating...

					JACK
				(quietly, to 
				 himself)
			You are Jack Campbell.  
			Youre better than this 
			sport.  You shot the 
			rapids at Kenai.  You ran 
			with the bulls at 
			Pamplona.  You jumped out 
			of a plane over the 
			Mojave Desert, for 
			Christs sake.  You can 
			do this...

		Jack puts everything he has into the throw, heaving the 
		ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he 
		can muster...hitting the six pin and taking out four 
		others.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(screaming, excited)
			Yeah!!

		He turns, a fist pumped...But the guys could care 
		less...

					ARNIE
				(to TEAMMATE)
			Okay, Pete, youre up.

    67	INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATE

		Jack walks out of the mens room, heading toward the 
		lounge.  He sees a familiar face walking toward him...a 
		woman in a sexy little bowling outfit, carrying a 
		bowling ball to a far lane.

					EVELYN
			Hi Jack...

		A moment of confusion as he tries to place the face.  
		Then...

					JACK
			Evelyn, right?

					EVELYN
			Very funny.  I saw you 
			out there on lane five.  
			What do you have the flu 
			or something?

					JACK
			Something like that.

					EVELYN
				(with a wink)
			Need a nurse?

					JACK
			Youre a nurse?

		Evelyn laughs.

					EVELYN
			If thats what you 
			want...

		She brushes past Jack, continuing to her lane...Jack 
		follows her with his eyes a moment, then...

					JACK
			Wait a second...

		She turns.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Are we...?

					EVELYN
			Are we what, Jack?

					JACK
			Is there something going 
			on between us?

		Evelyns surprised at Jacks directness.  She stands 
		there a beat, then walks back toward him.

					EVELYN
			Are we finally being 
			honest?

					JACK
			It would help me if we 
			were.

					EVELYN
			Okay, youre right, weve 
			been dancing around this 
			for years...

		Evelyn looks a little flush...she briefly fans her 
		face.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			God, my heart is racing.  
			Here goes...
				(a smile)
			When I get dressed for a 
			party and I know youre 
			going to be there... 
			well, lets just say I 
			dont go strapless 
			because my husband likes 
			it...

		An intrigued smile from Jack.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			Ive got six sets of snow 
			tires piled up in my 
			garage and I wont even 
			drive in the snow...And 
			our kids just happen to 
			be in the same ballet 
			class every year?

		She picks a piece of lint off his shirt.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			So, if youre asking me 
			whether Id like it to be 
			more, the answer is 
			yes...

		A look of surprise from Jack.

					EVELYN (CONTD)
			...and Kate would never 
			have to know.

		Jack considers this for a moment.

					JACK
			Do I have your number?

		A wide smile from Evelyn.

					EVELYN
			Steves out of town with 
			the kids this week.  Why 
			dont you just stop by...

		She turns, leaving Jack standing there, watching her 
		sashay back to her lane.

    68	INT. BOWLING ALLEY, LOUNGE - SECONDS LATER

		Jack walks into the lounge, a little dazed.  He heads 
		over to Arnie whos having a beer at the bar.

					ARNIE
				(looking at Jack)
			Hey Jack, youre all 
			flush.  I guess that 
			seventy-one took a lot 
			outta you.

					JACK
				(sitting down)
			I just saw Evelyn 
			Thompson.

					ARNIE
			She is relentless.

					JACK
			She wants to have an 
			affair with me.

					ARNIE
			She said that?

					JACK
			Pretty much.

					ARNIE
			Oh yeah...
				(shaking his head)
			What is it about you?

					JACK
				(pushing over a 
				 napkin)
			So could you write down 
			her exact address?

					ARNIE
			Whoa...whoa...wait a 
			second, Jack.  Youre not 
			actually gonna cheat on 
			Kate?

					JACK
			It wouldnt really be 
			cheating...
				(off Arnies 
				 doubtful  look)
			Its complicated.

					ARNIE
			Look, maybe Im not as 
			good a consigliere as you 
			are but you have to trust 
			me on this one.  A little 
			flirtations harmless but 
			youre playing with fire 
			here.  The Fidelity Bank 
			and Trust is a tough 
			creditor.  You make a 
			deposit somewhere else, 
			they close your account 
			forever.

					JACK
			Im telling you, those 
			rules dont apply to me, 
			Arn.

					ARNIE
				(a chuckle)
			Screw the rules.  Im 
			talking about the choice.

		Jack looks at him curiously.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons 
			got no class.  She 
			doesnt marry Dr. Steve, 
			the womans living in a 
			trailer.

					JACK
			Hey, is that really 
			necessary?

					ARNIE
			All Im saying it there 
			isnt a guy in Union 
			County who wouldnt give 
			his left nut to be 
			married to Kate...

		Arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up...

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Ill see ya later, 
			Jack...

		He leaves Jack alone, thinking...

		CHAPTER TEN - CAKE WARS

    69	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - NIGHT

		Jack walks into the house carrying his bowling bag.  He 
		dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the 
		kitchen where...

		Kate is at the counter, her back to him, poring over 
		some legal documents.

					KATE
				(not looking up)
			How was the game, honey?

					JACK
				(opening the fridge)
			Long, boring, and 
			generally pretty sad.  
			Arnie seemed to enjoy 
			it...
				(peering inside)
			Hey, wheres that chocolate 
			cake...?

		Kate turns around, revealing a huge hunk of chocolate 
		cake on a plate in front of her, a bite ready to go 
		into her mouth.

					KATE
				(with a smile)
			You mean this chocolate 
			cake?

					JACK
			Thats my piece.  I was 
			saving it because I got 
			nauseated from that store 
			bought chicken.

		Kate takes the bite, a little piece of icing sticks to 
		the side of her mouth.

					KATE
			Its good...

		Jack approaches the counter.

					JACK
			Gimme that cake.

		She takes another bite.

					KATE
			No way.

		He makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out 
		where he cant reach it.

					JACK
			Cmon.

					KATE
			Sorry, Jack.  Its too 
			important to me.

		They stare each other down a moment.  Then...

		He tries to swipe the plate.  Kate jumps out of her 
		chair, running out of the kitchen with the cake, 
		laughing...

		Jack takes off after her...chasing her through the 
		house... just about the catch up to her when...

		She darts up the stairs, still laughing...he follows 
		her...

					JACK
			I want that cake!

		...reaches up...grabs her shirt...pulls her down 
		playfully on top of him...

					KATE
				(laughing)
			You want the cake!?

					JACK
				(out of breath)
			I want it...

		She looks at him, then takes the whole piece in her 
		hand and smooshes it right in his mouth...

		Beat.  Then, Jack starts laughing...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Thank you...

					KATE
			Its good, right?

		He takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her 
		mouth.

		They stay there a moment, lying on the stairs, feeding 
		each other cake, laughing.

		Jack leans back on the stairs.  He looks at Kates 
		face, practically covered in cake, smiling, and 
		realizes...

		...he hasnt laughed like this in thirteen years.  
		Then...

					JACK
			Are the kids asleep?

		A sexy smile from Kate...they start kissing 
		passionately right there on the steps...its heating 
		up...

					KATE
				(caught up in the 
				 moment)
			Say it, Jack...

					JACK
			What...?

					KATE
			Cmon, you know what I 
			like to hear...

					JACK
				(in the throes 
				 of passion)
			Yeah, baby, I know what 
			you like to hear...

					KATE
				(kissing him)
			Then say it...just say it 
			to me...!

					JACK
				(swept up in the 
				 moment)
			Oh yeah, youre a bad 
			girl, baby... You make me 
			so hot...Im gonna take 
			you to that special 
			place...

		Kate pulls away.

					KATE
			What...?

		Jack looks up at her, he can practically see the 
		passion drain from her face...

					JACK
			Not it...?

					KATE
			Nice, Jack.  Youre 
			sweeping me off my feet.

					JACK
			What? You make me hot...

		She gets up and heads up the steps, disappearing into 
		the bedroom...Jack shakes his head, frustrated.  Then, 
		he feels something licking at his hand...

		He looks down and sees Lucy standing next to him, 
		wagging her tail, looking up at Jack with an Ive 
		gotta go look on her face.  Jack heaves a sigh, 
		then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cmon, Lucy, maybe one of 
			us can get a little 
			relief tonight...

		He leads the dog toward the front door...

    70	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack is walking Lucy.  He passes a house that looks 
		familiar to him.  Then he sees it...

		...the name THOMPSON etched on the mailbox...

		Its the Thompson house, now sans the garish Christmas 
		decorations, a drying Christmas tree tied up on the 
		curb, ready to be picked up as garbage...

		Jack stops, pulling the dog back, looking up at the 
		house...

		He sees a light on in the upstairs bedroom...the faint 
		outline of a woman reading by the window...

		EVELYN THOMPSON...

		Jack looks around, sees the street is empty, then 
		nudges the dog, leading her up the path to the house.

		He gets to the front door...moves his hand up to the 
		doorbell...but its a tentative move...he keeps it 
		there a moment, perched at the button...but for some 
		reason he cant bring himself to push it...

		He looks down the street, toward his own house, then to 
		the window upstairs.  Finally, he turns...

					JACK
				(pulling the leash)
			Cmon, girl, lets go 
			home...

    71	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE FOYER - MINUTES LATER

		The front door opens and Jack walks in with Lucy on a 
		leash, his face red from the cold outside.

		He gives the dog a pat on the rump, then takes off his 
		coat, hanging it and the leash on a hook by the door...

		He walks through the quiet house, into the living room, 
		rubbing his hands together to warm them up.

		CHAPTER ELEVEN  HOME MOVIES

		He goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a 
		scotch, taking a sip, letting the alcohol warm him...

		He strolls through the room, looking at some of the 
		family photos framed and hanging on the wall, focusing 
		on his own face in the pictures, studying the 
		expressions...

		He moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf, 
		marked with titles like, Trip to Yosemite, 96" and 
		Joshs 1st Birthday.  He runs his fingers along the 
		tapes, stopping at one marked, Jack Singing.  His 
		eyes linger there a moment...

		He puts his drink down and pops the tape in the VCR...

		ON TV:

		Its a party for Kates birthday thrown at the Kramers 
		house...same crowd of people as the Christmas party, 
		cheesy Happy Birthday decorations.

		The image jerks up and down, surveying the crowd...

		Bill Kramer at the piano, playing some light cocktail 
		music ...Kate talking with a group of friends...

					ARNIE (O.S.)
			Jesus, Bill, this thing 
			is an antique.  Dont you 
			even have image 
			stabilization?

		Bill stops playing and looks up at Arnie.

					BILL KRAMER
			Four hundred bucks at Best 
			Buy, Arn.

		Then...Jack comes into frame, a confident smile on his 
		face.

					JACK
			And everyone knows image 
			stabilization is for the 
			weak...

		Jack is jarred by the image of himself on the video...

		Jack on TV...he smiles as Kate walks into frame, easily 
		putting an arm around Jack...

					ARNIE
			So Jack, its your wifes 
			birthday, got anything to 
			say to her?

					JACK
				(to Kate)
			Its your birthday?  
			Today?  Whats your 
			name?  Where were you 
			born?

					KATE
			Jack.

					JACK
			Wait a minute.  Youre my 
			wife?

		She slaps him playfully on the arm...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I do have one thing I 
			wanna say...

		Kate looks at him expectantly.  Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(singing to her)
			Oh those fingers in my 
			hair, that sly come 
			hither stare, strips my 
			conscience bare, its 
			witchcraft... 

		Jack doesnt have the greatest voice in the world but 
		hes not the least bit self-conscious...and Kate seems 
		to like it, theres a twinkle in her eye...some of the 
		guests focus their attention on Jack and Kate. 

		Jack winces, embarrassed, as he watches himself sing...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...and Ive got no 
			defense for it, that heat 
			is too intense for it, 
			what good would common 
			sense for it do...

		Bill Kramer still at the piano, chimes in with the 
		basic chords for Witchcract, sounding it out as he 
		goes along...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...Cause its 
			witchcraft, wicked 
			witchcraft...and although 
			I know its strictly 
			taboo...when you rouse 
			the need in me, my heart 
			says yes indeed in me, 
			proceed with what youre 
			leadin me to...

		The camera catches the reactions of guests in the 
		crowd... the women, smiles on their faces, wrapped up 
		in the romance of the moment.  Envy on the mens faces 
		as they watch Jack serenade his wife...

		A musical interlude from Bill as Jack takes off his 
		jacket...some HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd...Arnie 
		captures the image of Kate whistling at her husband...

		Arnie follows with the camera as Jack strolls in front 
		of the gathered guests... 

					JACK (CONTD)
			Its such an ancient 
			pitch, but one that Id 
			never switch, there aint 
			no nicer witch than 
			you...

		Jack watches himself move gracefully.  But its no 
		longer embarrassment on his face, its fascination...

		Back in the video, the camera catches Evelyn Thompson 
		watching longingly as Jack moves back toward 
		Kate...Evelyn cant take it anymore, she abruptly turns 
		and walks toward the kitchen...

		Jack raises an eyebrow...

		In the video...Jack approaches Kate, she couldnt have 
		a more delighted look on her face.  He picks up the 
		verse...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cause its witchcraft, 
			that koo koo 
			witchcraft...and although 
			I know its strictly 
			taboo...

		The camera pans across the crowd, even the men are 
		getting into it, focused on Jack as he sings lovingly, 
		unashamed, to his wife...Nick Careli mouths the words 
		along with Jack, almost as if hes studying him, 
		revering him...

		Jack watches the TV, seeing Nick do this...maybe he 
		underestimated his alter ego...

		On the video...Jack staring into Kates eyes...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...when you rouse the 
			need in me, my heart says 
			yes indeed to me, proceed 
			with what youre leadin 
			me to...

		Jack and Kate exchange a sexy smile...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Its such an ancient 
			pitch, but one that Id 
			never switch...

		Jack kisses her on the lips...HOOTS and HOLLERS from 
		the crowd.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Cause theres no nicer 
			witch than you...

		Kate brushes a hand across Jacks face...

		Smash cut to Jack watching this...seeing the 
		connection, the heat between them...coveting it...

		Back to the video...the music building...the crowd 
		completely in the palm of Jacks hand...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...than you...

		The camera closes in on Jack and Kate as the music 
		builds to a crescendo...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...than you...

		A little musical flourish from Bill as the crowd breaks 
		out into huge CHEERS and APPLAUSE...

		Jack, watching this other version of himself in the video, 
		the center of attention, larger than life, focused on Kate...

		Back on video...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(speaking quietly 
				 to Kate)
			Happy Birthday 
			sweetheart...I love you.

		Kate leans over, giving Jack a deep kiss...OOHS and 
		AHHS from the crowd...but Jack and Kate are in their 
		own little world...

		Jack continues to watch himself on the video, his smile 
		fading, becoming a look of realization...then loss...

		A tear at the corner of his eye...

		The SOUND fades in Jacks head as the action in the 
		video continues...

		Hes left standing there...silent, still...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    72	INT. CAMPBELL MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

		Lucy licking Jacks face.  Jack pushes the dog 
		away...as...

		The ALARM RINGS.  Kate pushes the button to stop it.

					KATE
				(groggy)
			Time to get up, honey...

		Jack obliges without question, getting out of bed, 
		putting on a robe and slippers and exiting, still 
		practically half-asleep.

    73	INT. KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

		Jack walks into the kitchen.

		He turns on the Mr. Coffee, gets a bottle from the 
		fridge, throws it in the microwave, removes it, and 
		heads upstairs.

    74	INT. JOSHS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...into Joshs room.  Josh is wide awake, standing up 
		in his crib, like a prisoner in a cell.

		Jack gives him the bottle, pats his head perfunctorily, 
		and then walks out of the room...

		CHAPTER TWELVE - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY

    75	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...and back into the bedroom to find Kate, sitting on 
		the bed, a wrapped present in front of her and a wide 
		smile on her face.

		Jack stops, raising an eyebrow at the gift.  He looks 
		behind, as if to ask whether its for him, then back to 
		Kate.

					KATE
			Happy Anniversary, 
			honey...

		Terror on Jacks face.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(pushing the gift 
				 forward)
			Before you do whatever 
			crazy stunt youve got 
			planned I want you to 
			open mine...

		Jack musters up a smile, then approaches the gift.

					JACK
			Maybe I should wait...

					KATE
			No, open it...

		He hesitates, then begins unwrapping the package, 
		revealing...

		...a suit, similar in color and style to the Zegna 
		suit...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I found it at an outlet 
			store.  I know its a 
			knock-off, but I think 
			itll look great on 
			you...

					JACK
				(examining the label)
			Zeena...

		Jack is overcome with emotion...Yes, its a ZEENA, but 
		this is probably the nicest thing anyones ever done 
		for him...

					JACK (CONTD) 
				(tearing up)
			You really are 
			incredible...

					KATE
			Enjoy it, sweetheart...

		Jack looks at Kates expectant face, suddenly 
		remembering how truly screwed he is.

					JACK
			Youre probably expecting 
			something from me...

		Hes sweating bullets...watching as Kate gets a quizzical 
		look on her face...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Heres the thing.  I 
			really hadnt planned on 
			giving you your...uh... 
			anniversary gift until 
			tonight.
				(an uncomfortable 
				 smile)
			You know, anniversarys 
			good all day...

					KATE
			What are you talking 
			about?  You never wait 
			all day.  You can barely 
			wait until its light 
			out.

					JACK
			I know that, but...

		Beat.  Kate looks at him like shes looking into his 
		soul.

					KATE
			You forgot.

		Jack stands there, silent.

					KATE (CONTD)
			You actually forgot our 
			anniversary.

					JACK
			Ill fix it.  Ill go out 
			right now and get you 
			something.  Ill make it 
			right.

		That didnt help.

					KATE
				(holding back 
				 the tears)
			Jesus, Jack...Is this 
			where we are now?  Is 
			this our marriage?  
			Suddenly Im the wife who 
			has to drop hints two 
			weeks before her 
			anniversary so her 
			husband doesnt fuck it 
			up?

		Jack sees a tear run down her face...a pang of guilt on 
		his...

					JACK
			Please dont cry...

		Kate wipes the tear away but they just keep coming.

					KATE
				(shaking her head, 
				 crying)
			I dont want to be that, 
			Jack...

		Jack approaches her, holding out a hand but Kate pushes 
		it away, gets up and walks toward the bathroom...

		Jack is left standing alone, holding Kates gift...

		CUT TO:

    76	INT. FRONT PORCH - MINUTES LATER

		Jack emerges from the house, steps out onto the porch 
		for some air...

		He shakes his head, a mixture of frustration and self-
		pity on his face.

		He notices Annies bike leaning against the side of the 
		porch, and the bell that Cash gave him sitting on its 
		handle bar.

		He takes a step toward it, and gives the bell a gentle 
		RING ...he looks around, as if hes expecting someone 
		to appear ...but theres no one.  He RINGS the bell 
		again, louder this time, really trying to attract 
		someones attention.

					JACK
			Cmon...cmon...

		Nothing.  Finally, he lifts the bike up in the air, 
		RINGING the bell with everything hes got...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(shouting to the 
				 sky)
			Cmon, goddamnit, how was 
			I supposed to know the 
			date of their 
			anniversary!?  I never 
			married her!

		Pull back...Annie in the doorway...looking at him.

					ANNIE
				(slowly)
			Put the bicycle back on 
			the ground...

		Jack turns and sees her, gently lowering the bicycle.

    77	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

		Jack is mixing a glass of chocolate milk.  Annie, arms 
		folded, is waiting expectantly.  He finishes, sliding 
		the glass to her.

		She takes a long sip, puts the glass down, a chocolate 
		milk mustache on her lip.

					ANNIE
			Not bad...I shoulda 
			warned you.  Dad always 
			does something really 
			special for their 
			anniversary.

					JACK
			Like what?

					ANNIE
			One year he had a solar 
			system named after her...

					JACK
			Dont you think thats a 
			little gimmicky?

					ANNIE
			Mom liked it.

		Jack raises an eyebrow.

					JACK
			Maybe theres a jewelry 
			store back at the mall.  
			I could get her a pair of 
			earrings or something.

					ANNIE
			Thats good but...you did 
			forget the anniversary.

					JACK
			Right.  Thats a major 
			oversight...
				(thinking aloud)
			So if Im Kate...I cant 
			really afford the finer 
			things, my husbands 
			career is a crushing 
			disappointment to me, 
			Im trapped in suburbia...

		Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Did he ever take her to 
			the City?

		Annie smiles, impressed.

					ANNIE
			Youre really gettin the 
			hang of this.

		Suddenly, a look of confidence comes over Jacks face.  
		For the first time, he seems like a man in control.

    78	INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

		Annie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get 
		dressed.

		Kate, wearing a silky slip, walks out of her closet 
		carrying two dresses on hangers, a red one and a sexy 
		little black one.

		Kate holds out the two dresses to Annie.

					KATE
			Which do you think?

		Annie thinks about it for a moment, taking it very 
		seriously...

					ANNIE
			The black one...

		Kate nods.  Shes about to put it on when she looks at 
		Annie...

					KATE
			Fightings a part of it, 
			Annie.  You know that, 
			right?

					ANNIE
			Im not worried, Mom.  
			Hes still learning our 
			ways...

		Kate looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then nods.  
		Its true.  She puts down the dress and holds out a 
		hand to Annie.

					KATE
			Cmere.

		Kate leads her to the makeup table, then opens a 
		lipstick...

					ANNIE
				(excited)
			Really?

		Kate nods then applies some red lipstick to Annies 
		lips.

					KATE
			Now go like this...

		Kate rubs her lips together, showing Annie how to do 
		it.  Annie mimics her Mom, then Kate looks at her  
		Annies beaming.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Youre gonna break a lot 
			of hearts, you know.

		A smile from Annie...

		Pull back to reveal...Jack standing at the door, 
		watching ...appreciating the kind of mother Kate is...

    79   OMITTED

    80	EXT. LOIRE - NIGHT

		A small, elegant French restaurant hidden on a tree-
		lined lower Manhattan street.

    81	INT. LOIRE - SAME TIME

		Jack is wearing the suit Kate gave him.  Its not a 
		Zegna, but he looks pretty damn good.

		He leads Kate toward the cloak room at this intimate 
		restaurant...

		He helps her off with her coat.  Kates wearing the 
		sexy little black dress and we can immediately see its 
		effectiveness...

					JACK
			You look beautiful...

		A charmed smile from Kate as she hands Jack her coat.

		Jack hands the coats over to the COAT CHECK GIRL...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(instinctively)
			Thanks, Catherine...

		Jack fakes a SNEEZE, trying to cover up...Kate gives 
		him a pat on the back...

					KATE
			You okay?

		He takes Kate by the arm...

					JACK
			Fine...

		He leads her to the main room.

		She looks out at the room, elegant tables, French 
		country decor, a PIANIST playing Cole Porter...

					KATE
				(quietly to Jack)
			Jack...can we afford all 
			this?

					JACK
			Whats the difference?  
			Im taking my baby out 
			for our anniversary, damn 
			the costs...

					KATE
			How do you even know 
			about this place?

		Jacks caught for a moment.  Then...

					JACK
			Arnie...
				(insistent)
			Arnie.  Hell throw you a 
			curve ball once in a 
			while, thats for sure...

		Jack puts his arm around her and kisses her on the 
		cheek...

    82	INT. LOIRE - A LITTLE LATER

		Jack and Kate sit at a secluded table, a WAITER 
		standing next to them.  Jacks not even looking at the menu.

					JACK
			Well have the tureen of 
			quail breast with 
			shiitake mushrooms to 
			start, then the veal 
			medallions in raspberry 
			truffle sauce and the sea 
			scallops with pureed 
			artichoke hearts...sea 
			scallops, North of the 
			Caspian...

		Kate looks at Jack, a mixture of confusion and awe on 
		her face.

					WAITER
			Very good, sir.  And may 
			I say those are all 
			excellent selections.

					JACK
			You may...
				(perusing the 
				 wine list)
			Also, well have a bottle 
			of Lafite, 1982.

		Kate reaches over and pulls down the wine list, reading 
		it upside down.

					KATE
			Its five hundred and 
			fifty dollars, Jack!

		A wince from Jack...for a moment there it was almost 
		perfect.

					JACK
			Just a glass of red wine 
			for each of us...

		The waiter nods, then walks toward the kitchen...

					KATE
			You are so not off the 
			hook yet, slick.

					JACK
			But Im gettin close, right?

		A noncommittal nod from Kate.  Then Jack notices her 
		look over at the pianist, drawn in by the music.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You want to dance?

		A puzzled look from Kate.  Theres nobody else 
		dancing.  There isnt even much room to dance...

					KATE
			I dont think theres 
			dancing here, Jack.

		Jack gets up and holds out a hand.

					JACK
			Sure there is...

		Kate looks around again, then she smiles.

		Kate rises, taking his hand.  Jack takes her in his 
		arms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space, 
		confident and self-assured.

		The pianist looks up, smiling, appreciating their role 
		in this romantic moment.

		Kate moves with Jack, following his lead comfortably.  
		They look good together...in sync with each other...

		People are watching them...some of the men are 
		impressed, others are scoffing, but the women are 
		clearly charmed...

					KATE
				(whispering to 
				 Jack)
			Pretty good for a tire 
			salesman from Jersey...

		Jack flashes her his most charming smile.

					JACK
			I have my moments...

		They continue to dance, in a world of their own...

    83	INT. LOIRE - LATE

		Jack and Kate at the table enjoying a gourmet meal.  
		Jack holds out a fork with a piece of veal for Kate.  
		She takes a bite.

					KATE
			Mmmm...
				(spearing a scallop)
			...here, try one of 
			these...

		Jack takes a scallop from Kates fork.

					JACK
				(savoring the scallop) 
			God I missed that 
			taste...

		Kate laughs.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Why are you laughing?

		Kate shoots him a look of curiosity.  Jack looks back 
		at her, sees the trust in her face...He puts down his 
		fork.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I need to tell you 
			something.

					KATE
			Okay...

					JACK
			I think it may help us 
			but theres a slight 
			chance it could make 
			things worse.

		She hears the seriousness in his voice.

					KATE
			Now Im worried...just 
			say it.  Whatever it is 
			well deal with it.

					JACK
			Are you sure?

		She nods.  Jack searches his mind for the right words.  
		Then...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I feel like Im living 
			someone elses life...

		Jack looks to her, expecting the worst.  But she just 
		nods reassuringly.  He continues...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I used to be so sure 
			about everything, you 
			know?  I knew exactly who 
			I was and what I wanted.  
			Then one morning I woke 
			up and suddenly it was 
			all different...

					KATE
			Worse, you mean...

					JACK
			No.  Well, maybe a few 
			things.  But mostly just 
			different...

		Jack lets out a small smile.  Now hes the one whos 
		reassuring Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I never used to be like 
			this, Kate.  I had it all 
			figured out.  No doubts, 
			no regrets.

					KATE
			And now...?

					JACK
			Now...I dont...

		He looks at her, staring into her eyes, almost 
		desperate for understanding.

					KATE
			Me neither.

		A raised eyebrow from Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I think its good to be a 
			little unsure about who 
			you are.  Its very 
			human.

					JACK
			But you always seem so 
			certain.

					KATE
			Cmon, Jack, you think 
			there arent mornings 
			when I wake up and wonder 
			what the hell Im doing 
			in New Jersey...

					JACK
			Thats a big one for me, 
			too.

					KATE
			My office is a dump, I 
			answer my own phone...and 
			youve seen my pay check.

					JACK
			Your pay check is a 
			disgrace to pay checks.

					KATE
			I mean yes, I help people 
			that need it...

					JACK
			I guess...some of them 
			are probably faking.

					KATE
				(a laugh, then...)
			God, sometimes I think it 
			would be so nice not to 
			have to stretch ground 
			beef or maybe drive a car 
			with a CD player...

		He smiles, right there with her.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Imagine having a life 
			where everything was 
			easy...where you asked 
			for things and people 
			just brought them to 
			you...

					JACK
			Its wonderful...

		Kate laughs, nodding.

		A pause, then...

					KATE
			I think about it, too, 
			Jack.  I do.  I think 
			about the kind of person 
			Id be if I hadnt 
			married you...

		Its as if shes inside his head.  They stay like this 
		for a moment, looking into each other.

					JACK
			And...?

		She stops a moment, considering.  Then...

					KATE
			And I realize Ive just 
			erased the things in my 
			life Im most sure 
			about.  You, the kids...

		Jack nods.

					JACK
			Good things...

					KATE
			What are you sure about?

		Jack looks into Kates eyes.

					JACK
			Im sure that right now 
			theres nowhere Id 
			rather be than here with 
			you...

		Kate smiles at Jack, a loving, secure smile.  Its been 
		a while.

		CUT TO:

    84	EXT. PENSION - NIGHT

		The mini-van parked outside a small brownstone right on 
		the square.  Its like something out of a Henry James 
		novel... charming, meticulously maintained, elegant...

    85	INT. PENSION, SUITE - A LITTLE LATER

		The door opens and Jack, carrying Kate in his arms, 
		enters...

		Jack puts Kate down and she takes in the room, antique 
		furniture...its like walking into another world...

					KATE
			This is so beautiful...

		Jack smiles as he opens a champagne bottle sitting on a 
		silver ice bucket...

					KATE (CONTD)
			You know champagne makes 
			me do crazy things.

					JACK
				(pouring)
			Ill just full yours up 
			to the top.
				(handing her a 
				 glass)
			Happy anniversary, 
			sweetheart.

		Kate smiles, clinking her glass with Jacks.

					KATE
			I dont know how you did 
			it, hoss, but you pulled 
			it off.

					JACK
			Im out of the doghouse?

					KATE
			Way out...

		Kate saunters into the bedroom, looking at the king-
		size poster bed, feeling the down quilt.  Jack follows 
		her...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(turning to him)
			You may even get lucky 
			tonight...

		Kate kisses him...when their lips separate, we can see 
		the powerful effect it has on him.

		Jack looks deep into her eyes, stroking her hair, lost 
		in her.

					JACK
			Youre so...beautiful...

					KATE
			I already told you you 
			were gonna get lucky, 
			Jack...

		They kiss again, a long soulful kiss.  Then...

		Jack pulls back, a look of realization on his face...

					JACK
			My god, all this time...I 
			never stopped loving 
			you...

					KATE
				(a wide smile) 
			Thats all I wanted to 
			hear...

		She kisses him, their bodies intertwined...hands 
		caressing ...more and more passionate...then reaches 
		behind her to the light.  The room goes dark...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    86	INT. PENSION, SUITE - MORNING

		Morning sun streams onto Jack and Kate in bed...

		Kate, in Jacks arms, her head on his chest, a 
		contented smile on her face...

		Jacks eyes open...adjust to the light.  He looks over 
		at Kate.

		Theres something different in his eyes...something 
		deeper.  Jack smiles...a broad, Im in love kind of 
		smile.

		Kate stirs, gently stroking Jacks chest.

					KATE
			Mmmm...Jack...

		Kate lifts her head, turning to face Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I feel like I should give 
			you money...

		Jack laughs.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I mean, my god, Jack you 
			were always good but 
			this...this was... like a 
			porno movie.

		Kate lays her head back on Jacks chest, looking at 
		Washington Square through the window.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I could stay here 
			forever...

					JACK
			I dont think Id fight 
			you on that one...

		Kate lifts her head and looks at him expectantly.  They 
		kiss.

    87	EXT. NEW JERSEY STREET - NIGHT

		The mini-van passes a sign that reads, Welcome to 
		Teaneck.

    88	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, VARIOUS - MORNING

		Annie walking through the downstairs of the house, 
		practicing her violin...its a noise bordering on 
		MUSIC, but not quite...

		She walks into the kitchen where...

		Jack stands at the counter in his robe, reading the 
		Newark Star Ledger and drinking a cup of coffee.

		He lowers the paper, watches Annie with a smile as she 
		strolls through the room playing her violin badly...he 
		goes back to his paper.

    89	INT. JACKS CLOSET - MINUTES LATER

		Jack, still singing, donning his Dockers and short-
		sleeve oxford...

   89A	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

		The front door of the Campbell House...

		Jack emerges in his work clothes, putting his coat on, 
		a bagel in his mouth...

		He disappears from frame, the screen door closing 
		slowly behind him...

		In a moment...Kate appears at the door, a cup of coffee 
		in her hand...she follows Jack with her eyes as he 
		heads to the car.

		Then...a smile from Kate...

		In a moment...Jack returns to frame and heads straight 
		into Kates arms...

		...a passionate kiss as she leans against the door 
		post...

					KATE
			Have a good day...

		A smile from Jack as she pats him on the ass and sends 
		him on his way...

    90	EXT. BIG EDS - AFTERNOON

		Jack, pointing to a stack of radials, is standing with 
		a MAN (40s) wearing a pale blue leisure suit and a pair 
		of high top Nike Air Jordans.

					JACK
			For the money, theyre 
			hands down the best 
			radial we carry...

					MAN
				(thinking, then...)
			Okay, Ill take them...

					JACK
			You wont regret it...
				(shouting to Tommy)
			Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up 
			with four B.F. Goodrich 
			G-Force T/As...
				(looking the man 
				 over)
			...and give him ten 
			percent off for having 
			the best costume...

		Just then, a black ROLLS ROYCE SILVER SERAPH pulls into 
		the lot, its front left tire riding on the rim...

					ESTELLE (O.S.)
				(over P.A. system)
			Jack, Kate on line two!  
			Jack pick up two!

		Jack turns toward the door, but then looks curiously 
		back at the Rolls...something familiar about it...

		Then...Peter Lassiter gets out of the car...

					KENNY
				(walking out to Jack)
			Kates on two, Jack.
				(on seeing the Rolls)
			Nice ride...

					JACK
				(staring at Lassiter)
			If youre into that kind 
			of conspicuous 
			consumption...

					KENNY
			You want me to handle 
			him?  I think Im 
			ready...

					ESTELLE (O.S.)
				(over P.A. system)
			Jack!  Kate still holding 
			on line two...

					JACK
			Sure...be careful, he 
			looks like a tough 
			negotiator...

		Jack walks inside...

    91	INT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		...but hes still focused on Lassiter through the 
		window, cant take his eyes off him...

		He gets to the phone...sees the light for line two 
		blinking ...he looks back outside, sees Kenny approach 
		Lassiter...

		...back to the blinking phone light...he picks up the 
		phone...

		But cant bring himself to hit the blinking light.  
		Then...

					JACK
				(to Estelle, into 
				 intercom)
			Tell Kate Ill call her 
			back...

		INTERCUT WITH ESTELLE IN HER OFFICE

					ESTELLE 
				(into intercom)
			It sounded pretty 
			important.

					JACK
				(into intercom)
			Im with a customer.  
			Ill call her back.

		He takes his hand away from the phone and walks back 
		outside the store...

		CHAPTER THIRTEEN - PETER LASSITER

    92	EXT. BIG EDS TIRES - CONTINUOUS

		...towards Kenny and Lassiter.

					LASSITER
				(to Kenny)
			I seem to have had some 
			kind of blow out...

		Jack approaches, tapping Kenny on the shoulder.

					JACK
			Why dont you let me take 
			this one, Kenny?

					KENNY
			Okay, chief.

		Kenny nods then heads back inside...

					JACK
			Peter Lassiter...

					LASSITER
				(surprised)
			Do I know you?

					JACK
			Not exactly. Ive seen you 
			on CNBC.
				(with a smile)
			You look taller in real 
			life...

		CUT TO:

    93	INT. BIG EDS TIRED, JACKS OFFICE - LATE

		Jack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his 
		cluttered, cramped office.

					JACK
			...truth is, Mintz was so 
			busy timing his wifes 
			breathing he didnt see 
			that MedTech needed 
			Global more than the 
			other way around.  Ten 
			days, two weeks tops, 
			they wouldve approached 
			you with an offer, and 
			Id bet anything it 
			wouldve been thirty 
			billion, not twenty 
			nine...
				(a knowing smile)
			Problem was, Peter, you 
			had a pussycat running 
			the show. What you needed 
			was a rottweiler.

		Lassiter, sitting on the little chair across from Jack, 
		an intrigued look on his face...

					LASSITER
				(nodding)
			Well, Im impressed.

		A smile from Jack.

					LASSITER (CONTD)
			I really am...

		Jack savors the moment, until...

					LASSITER (CONTD)
			So, about my car...

		Hes jarred back to reality, a little crestfallen...

					JACK
			Sure. Were going to 
			have to special order 
			that tire. Itll be 
			ready in about two days.

		Lassiter nods, then takes a business card out of his 
		wallet.

					LASSITER
			This has my office address 
			on it...
				(thinking, then...)
			Why dont you drop it off 
			yourself?

		A smile from Jack.

		CUT TO:

    94	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JACKS BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Kate, sound asleep in bed...

		Pan across to Jack, his eyes wide open, lost in 
		thought...

    95	INT. BIG EDS, JACKS OFFICE - DAY

		Jack wearing his Zeena suit, sitting behind his desk, 
		distracted, as he listens to HECTOR, 40s, the 
		GUATEMALEN MECHANIC.

					HECTOR
			...I say to her, Margarita, 
			we already have four kids, 
			why do we need more?

		Jack is shaking his leg anxiously under the desk as he 
		eyes the door...
					
					HECTOR (CONTD)
			But she say she want an 
			even number. I say four 
			is an even number! But 
			she say she want six.

		Jack checks his watch...

					HECTOR (CONTD)
			I tell her, Margarita, I 
			just got my green card, 
			I like to sit back and 
			rest a little bit...

					JACK
				(interrupting)
			Hector...do I usually 
			listen to your personal 
			problems?

					HECTOR 
			Sure, Jack, all the time...

		Jack nods, then...

					JACK
			Look, I have some business 
			that I have to take care 
			of in the city so Im 
			leaving early...
				(getting up)
			My advice to you...follow 
			your dreams.

		CUT TO:

    96	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - AFTERNOON

		Jack pulling up to the building in Lassiters Rolls...

		He gets out of the car, walks to the building, feeling 
		good, confident, stopping to gaze up at the 
		skyscraper...he breathes in deeply, then heads 
		inside...

    96A	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

		Jack enters, instinctively tossing the car keys to the 
		SECURITY GUARD...the guard looks at him like hes 
		crazy...

    97	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Lassiter walk together...

					LASSITER
			...were really more of a 
			boutique operation, as 
			you can see...

					JACK
			But youre not interested 
			in boutique dollars...
				(a smile)
			I get it...

		They walk into...

    98	INT. ALAN MINTZS OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Past the assistants desk...

					MINTZS ASSISTANT
				(seeing Lassiter)
			Hes expecting you, Mr. 
			Lassiter...

		Lassiter doesnt even slow down...

    99	INT. ALAN MINTZS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

		Its Jacks old office but you wouldnt know it from 
		the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a 
		play pen where the bar used to be.  Jack enters, 
		immediately struck by the difference...

					LASSITER
				(to Mintz)
			Alan, this is Jack 
			Campbell...the one I was 
			telling you about...

		Mintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the 
		desk and goes to shake Jacks hand.

					ALAN
			Jack, of course.

		They shake hands.

					JACK
				(appropriately 
				 deferential)
			Mr. Mintz.

					ALAN
			Please, call me Alan. We 
			try to cultivate a casual 
			atmosphere around here...

					JACK
				(re: play pen)
			I can see that, Alan.

		A chuckle from Mintz.

					ALAN
			You have kids, Jack?

					JACK
				(hesitating, then...)
			Uh...actually, yes. Two...
			good ones.

		Another laugh from Mintz.

					ALAN
			Thats great...
				(gesturing to 
				 the sofa)
			Why dont you have a seat?

		Jack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and 
		Lassiter take the chairs.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			So, Peter mentioned that 
			you were an avid CNBC 
			watcher but didnt say 
			whether you had any 
			actual Wall Street 
			experience?

		Jacks a little taken aback by the question, not 
		realizing he was walking into an interview...

		He crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable.

					JACK
			I was a sales associate, 
			at E.F. Hutton.

					ALAN
			A broker? Really. And now 
			youre in the tire 
			business?

					JACK
			Thats right. And auto 
			supply...

					ALAN
			Uh huh. The retail end, I 
			understand.

		Jack nods...

					JACK
			Uh...we actually get about 
			sixty percent of our 
			business from automotive 
			service.

					ALAN
			Mind if I ask what kind of 
			sales you did last year? 
			Ballpark...

					JACK
			We did one point seven 
			million in total revenue...

					ALAN
			Uh huh...one point seven.  
			And what do you project for 
			this year?

		Jack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing 
		questions, the smirk on Mintzs face...


					ALAN (CONTD)
			Any thoughts at all on 
			that?

		As Jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent 
		of his handicap...

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Jack?

		He stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter 
		then ...a confident smile.

					JACK
			Well, Alan, I think were 
			gonna have a banner year.  
			Sales are up almost 
			twenty percent in the 
			first quarter and we just 
			landed a major trucking 
			company account.

					ALAN
			Really. So youre 
			projecting what, a tad 
			over two million?

		A gleam in Jacks eye.

					JACK
			Thats right. And that 
			would make us number one 
			in our market...
				(getting up)
			You mind if I stand?

		A raised eyebrow from Mintz.

		Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he 
		crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of 
		water...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Look, I know our paltry 
			little two million in 
			sales is about what you 
			spend on office supplies 
			in a year.  And I know 
			some regional trucking 
			company account is 
			nothing compared to a 
			sixty billion dollar 
			merger...

					ALAN
			Im not trying to knock 
			the tire business, Jack.

					JACK
				(a confident chuckle)
			Its okay, Alan. I get it. 
			Im in your shoes, Im 
			thinking exactly the same 
			thing...but heres the 
			thing. Business is 
			business.  Wall Street, 
			Main Street, its all 
			just a bunch of people 
			getting up in the morning, 
			trying to figure out how 
			the hell theyre gonna 
			send their kids to 
			college.  Its just 
			people...

		Jacks confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter 
		appears intrigued...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And I know people.

					ALAN
			Im sure you do...

					LASSITER
				(intervening)
			Lets let the man have 
			his say...

		Mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile...

					JACK
				(to Mintz)
			Take you, for instance...

					ALAN
				(defensive)
			What about me?

					JACK
			You drink about sixteen 
			Diet Cokes a day. Youre 
			an excellent father, but 
			you feel guilty about the 
			time you spend away from 
			home. You drink bourbon, 
			but you offer your 
			clients scotch...

		Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And your wife decorated 
			this office...

		A laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a 
		caught look on his face.

					LASSITER
			He certainly has your 
			number, Alan.

					JACK
				(turning to Lassiter)
			Youre a little tougher, 
			Peter.

		A raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but hes game...

					JACK (CONTD)
			For one thing, you like 
			expensive things.

					LASSITER
				(smiling proudly) 
			Thats easy. Youve seen 
			my car.

					JACK
				(a chuckle)
			Okay...you smoke Hoyo de 
			Monterreys. Youre a 
			scotch man, single malt, 
			not because its trendy 
			but because youve been 
			doing it for forty years, 
			and you stay with what 
			works. You have two great 
			loves in your life, your 
			horses and this company.  
			You wept openly the day 
			the Dow hit ten thousand...

		Lassiters impressed.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And youre a man who 
			prides himself on finding 
			talent in unusual 
			places...


					LASSITER
			Oh? And how would you 
						know that?

		Jack smiles.

					JACK
			Because Im here.

		On Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on 
		smile.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Im prepared to do 
			anything it takes to get 
			this job. Start anywhere 
			you need me to start.  
			Ill park cars if I 
			to...
				(into Lassiters 
				 eyes)
			The biggest part of 
			judging character is 
			knowing yourself. And I 
			know this, I can do this 
			job. Give me a chance, 
			Peter, I wont let you 
			down.

		Lassiter returns Jacks gaze with equal intensity. In a 
		moment, he turns to Mintz.

					LASSITER
				(to Mintz)
			Alan, why dont you show 
			Jack around a bit...

					ALAN
			Id love to.

		CUT TO:

    100	INT. LASSITER BUILDING CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

		Jack and Alan walking side by side down the hallway... 
		EMPLOYEES passing them by, greeting Mintz, Mintz waving 
		back...

					ALAN
				(pointing)
			...thats our war room.  
			We did seven major deals 
			last year, three of them 
			hostile.

					JACK
				(not particularly 
				 impressed)
			Seven.  Really.

		They turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of 
		the corridor.

		Mintz stops, turning to Jack.  Jack returns Mintzs 
		gaze with a quizzical look.

					ALAN
			Lets cut the shit, huh 
			Campbell? What, did you go 
			through his wallet or 
			something?

		Jacks a little taken aback.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			No matter. That circus 
			act back there may have 
			dazzled Lassiter 
			momentarily but it 
			doesnt do shit forme.  
			Even if you get this job, 
			which I highly doubt, let 
			me warn you, Lassiter 
			loses interest in his pet 
			projects very quickly. 
			Im in the big office 
			because Ive proved 
			myself to him year after 
			year and nobody is going 
			to come in here and start 
			turning the old mans 
			head. Especially not some 
			tire salesman from New 
			Jersey. So you watch 
			yourself and stay away 
			from Lassiter, and maybe, 
			just maybe, Ill keep you 
			on after he gets tired of 
			you. Do we understand 
			each other?

		Jack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent, 
		expressionless.

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Do we?!

		Then, a broad smile from Jack.

					JACK
			God, you really are 
			different, arent you...
				(nodding)
			I mean...wow...I am 
			impressed.

		Now its Mintzs turn to look quizzical.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Good for you. Why shouldnt 
			you protect whats yours.

					ALAN
			I dont think youre hearing 
			me.

					JACK
			Oh, Im hearing you, Alan.  
			Thats not the problem.  
			The problem is that what 
			you think is yours, is 
			really mine.  And I dont 
			care how low on the totem 
			pole I start, I will get 
			it back...
				(poking him in 
				 the chest)
			So do yourself a favor and 
			dont get too attached to 
			that view because sometime 
			soon, maybe very soon, you
			and your French country 
			antiques, your chintz sofa, 
			and your little play pen 
			are gonna be moving out of 
			that office.

		Jack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Oh, and by the way, you 
			try selling tires for a 
			living.  I promise you, 
			youd starve.

		Jack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune, 
		leaving Mintz standing there, bewildered.

		CHAPTER FOURTEEN - A PERFECT LIFE?

		CUT TO:

    101	INT. CORPORATE APARTMENT - DAY

		A double door opens and Jack leads Kate into this huge 
		duplex.  Kate looks around, taking the place in.

					JACK
			Welcome to Xanadu...

		The place is incredible...marble floors, architectural 
		lines, high tech fixtures, elegant modern furniture...
		its striking but not at all homey like the Jersey 
		house.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Pretty incredible, isnt 
			it?

					KATE
			Its like a museum.

		Jack nods.

					KATE (CONTD)
				(turning to Jack)
			So whats the big 
			surprise? You didnt 
			rent this place for 
			the weekend, did you?

					JACK
			Think bigger.

					KATE
			For the week?

		Jack chuckles.

					JACK
			This place is a perk, 
			Kate.

					KATE
			A perk for what?

					JACK
			A company called P.K. 
			Lassiter and Associates 
			Investment House uses it 
			to attract new 
			executives...

		Kates confused.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Youre talking to their 
			new Vice President of 
			Mergers and Acquisitions.

					KATE
			What are you talking 
			about, Jack?


					JACK
			Im going into arbitrage, 
			honey.  Turns out I have 
			a knack for it.  Ill be 
			making two hundred grand 
			a year plus a hefty bonus
			and thats just to 
			start.  And, we can live 
			in this apartment 
			practically rent free for 
			as long as we want.

		Jack measures her reaction. Its not good...

					JACK (CONTD)
			We can finally afford to 
			move back into the city.  
			In style.

		Kate just looks at him, in shock. Then...

					KATE
			Are you out of your mind?

					JACK
			I dont think so. This 
			is going to be a better 
			life for all of us, 
			honey.  Well put Annie 
			and Josh in private 
			schools...

					KATE
			Annie goes to a great 
			school.

					JACK
			Im talking about the 
			best schools in the 
			country here, Kate...

					KATE
			Jack, what could you 
			possibly be thinking?  
			What about my job?

					JACK
			This is New York City, 
			its like the needy 
			people capital of the 
			world.  Those Jersey 
			clients of yours arent a 
			tenth as pathetic as the 
			ones you could get 
			here...

					KATE
				(cutting him off)
			I cant believe you want 
			to move back into the 
			city.  I thought the 
			reason we left was 
			because we didnt want to 
			raise the kids here?

					JACK
			No, this is the center of 
			the universe.  If I were 
			living in Roman times, I 
			would live in Rome, where 
			else?  Today, America is 
			the Roman Empire and New 
			York is Rome itself. 
			John Lennon.

					KATE
				(cutting him off) 
			Jack.

		Jacks starting to struggle...

					JACK
			Look, Im detecting a 
			kind of funky tension 
			here...We dont have to 
			live in this apartment. 
			I dont need this...Ill 
			commute...Ill drive to 
			work...

		Jacks back on his heels...seeing his dream picked 
		apart...

					KATE
			In traffic?  Its over an 
			hour each way?  Thats 
			almost three hours a 
			day.  When are you going 
			to see the kids?

		Hes frustrated...he pauses a moment to gather 
		himself. Then...

					JACK
			Kate. Youre not 
			understanding me. Im 
			talking about a great 
			life.  A perfect life.  
			Everything we pictured 
			when we were young. The 
			whole package. You said 
			it yourself, life has 
			thrown us surprises, and 
			so we made sacrifices.  
			But now I can finally get 
			us back on track...

		A sad chuckle from Kate.

					JACK (CONTD)
			I can do that.  I want to 
			do that.  For all of us.  
			I need to do that as a 
			man...
				(imploring her)
			Think about it.  No more 
			lousy restaurants, no 
			more clipping coupons, no 
			more shoveling snow...

					KATE
			Then get a goddamn snow 
			blower!

		Jacks taken aback by the intensity of her tone.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Dont get a new career 
			without even telling me.  
			Dont take Annie out of a 
			school she loves.  Dont 
			move us out of a house 
			weve become a family 
			in...

		Kate stands there, wounded...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(quietly)
			Dont do that...

					JACK
			Look, youre making this 
			into something its not. 
			This isnt a referendum 
			on our lives, Kate. Its 
			a step forward...
				(appealing to her)
			Dont you see?  Im 
			talking about us finally 
			having a life other 
			people envy.

		Silence.  Kate looks him in the eye  a deep, piercing 
		look...

					KATE
			They already do envy us, 
			Jack...

		Kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.

    103	INT. ANNIES ROOM - NIGHT

		Annie is in a nightgown, practicing her violin. Jack 
		walks in.

		Its all he can do to hold back cringing at the missed 
		notes. Annie finishes the piece, lowering the bow.

					JACK
			Very nice. What is it?

					ANNIE
			Mary Had A Little Lamb.

					JACK
			Ah. A classic...

		Annie starts PLAYING again as Jack looks at the 
		dresser. She has 20 or so family photos lined up and 
		down its sides...

		Jack studies them...in every one Jacks face is totally 
		contented.  Jack studies them, looking at his own face.

		Annie lowers the bow, watching him...

		Jack turns to her.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Please dont stop...

		She smiles, then starts PLAYING again.  He turns back 
		to the pictures...

    104	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, DEN - LATE

		Jack...standing in front of the desk, nursing a drink.

		He looks at Lassiters business card, sitting on the 
		surface of the desk...

		He gazes around the room...his eyes coming to rest on a 
		bookshelf...a book...

		He moves toward it...looking at its spine...its a 
		tattered copy of Vonneguts Cats Cradle.  He pulls 
		it off the shelf, theres something inside...a 
		bookmark...

		...a PAN AM ticket jacket sleeve...

		...inside...a boarding pass...From: London/Heathrow, 
		To: New York/JFK, 10/4/87.

		He looks at it...somethings not right...

					JACK
			From London to New York...?
				(looking up)
			I came back...

		Then...a NOISE...

		Jack turns and sees Kate walking into the doorway, 
		standing there...She sees Jack holding the Pan Am 
		ticket sleeve.

					KATE
			Our finest moment, 
			right...

		A quizzical look from Jack.

					KATE (CONTD)
			When you got on that 
			plane I was sure it was 
			over.  I left the airport 
			afraid Id never see you 
			again.  And then you 
			showed up the very next 
			day...
				(a wistful smile)
			That was a good 
			surprise...

		She continues into the room, leaning against a 
		bookshelf.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I think about you on that 
			plane, about what must 
			have been going through 
			your mind...you sitting 
			there imagining our life 
			together, our life 
			apart...I think about the 
			decision you made...

		Jack watches her as she lets out a small sigh.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Maybe I was being naive 
			but I believed wed grow 
			old together in this 
			house.  That wed spend 
			holidays here, have g
			randchildren visit us 
			here.  I had this image 
			of us all grey and 
			wrinkly, me working in 
			the garden, you 
			repainting the deck...

		Kate smiles gently as she pictures this.

					KATE (CONTD)
			Things change, right?  
			People change...
				(pausing)
			If you need this, Jack, I 
			mean really need this, I 
			will take these children 
			from a life they love, 
			and take myself from the 
			only home weve ever 
			shared, and move wherever 
			you need to go.  Ill do 
			that because I love 
			you...

		The words are like a warm embrace for Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I love you, Jack. And  
			thats more important to 
			me than our address...

		Kate smiles lovingly at Jack...she walks over to him, 
		kisses him gently on the forehead.

					KATE (CONTD)
			I choose us.

		She turns and heads out of the room, leaving him there, 
		the boarding pass still in hand, staring lovingly at 
		her as she goes...

    105	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks into the room...

		The lights are off, Kate already in bed sleeping.

		He undresses for bed, unable to take his eyes off Kate.

		Finally, he lifts the covers and climbs into bed next 
		to her, moving closer to her, putting an arm around 
		her, drawing her in...

		In her sleep, Kate nestles in Jacks embrace.  He 
		savors the feeling, then closes his eyes as...

		They lay there...side by side...together...a single 
		person.

		DISSOLVE TO:

    106	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

		The morning light streams into the room.  Kate opens 
		her eyes.  Jacks not in bed.  A look of curiosity.

		Then, she hears LAUGHTER from outside.

		She goes over to the window...opens the blinds... 
		revealing...

		Jack in the backyard, LAUGHING with joy, playing in the 
		snow with Annie and Josh.

		Kate watches...a satisfied smile sweeping across her 
		face...

    107	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BACKYARD - SAME TIME

		...Jack reaches out and snags Annie...she CACKLES in 
		delight...

		The three of them fall over onto the soft white snow...

		The laughter from the kids is uncontrollable, Jacks 
		joy is just as palpable...

		Finally, Annie stops laughing and grabs Jack around the 
		neck, hugging his tight.

					ANNIE
				(whispering in 
				 Jacks ear)
			I knew youd come back...

		DISSOLVE TO:

    108	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

		Jack walks over to a utility shelf, fishing around 
		until he finds a bag of rock salt...he grabs it, sees 
		its empty...

		And then he hears it...the sound of a BICYCLE BELL 
		RINGING, echoing through the room.

		A shudder passes through his body...

		He turns and sees Annie at the open garage door, 
		sitting on her bike, ringing the BELL.

		Its an eerie moment for Jack...

					JACK
			What are you doing?

					ANNIE
				(a curious look)
			Ringing my bell...

		On Jacks anxious face...

		CHAPTER FIFTEEN  SAYING GOODBYE

    110	INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

		On Jack...crouched down in an aisle of this local 
		convenience store...checking out the bags of rock 
		salt...

		He looks at the price tag on one of the bags...

					JACK
			Four ninety nine?! Its just 
			salt for gods sake...

		On the entrance to the store...the door opens, a YOUNG 
		GIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager...

		She glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package 
		of gum...

		From the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach 
		the counter...

		On Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of 
		salt from the shelf, when...

					CASH (O.S.)
			Thatll be sixty five cents, 
			little angel...

		Jack registers the voice...he rises slowly, looking 
		over to the front counter...where he sees...

		Cash, dressed in a typical chain convenience store 
		uniform, ringing up the teenager...

		An excited smile from Jack at the sight of Cash...

					JACK
			You...!

		Then...the color drains from Jacks face...

					JACK (CONTD)
			What are you doing here...

		Jack moves toward Cash at the counter...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Youre not sending me 
			back...

		The girl eyes Jack curiously, then removes a dollar 
		bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter 
		to Cash...

					CASH
			Jack, its good to see 
			you...

		Cash reaches into the register, taking out change for 
		ten dollars...he hands the girl $9.35...

					CASH (CONTD)
				(to the girl)
			Thank you darlin...

		The girl looks at the money, realizing that Cash has 
		given her the wrong change...

					CASH (CONTD)
				(back to Jack, 
				 seeing the
				 rock salt)
			What do you got there, 
			rock salt?  Look at you, 
			all domestic and shit...
			You really figured some 
			things out, huh?

		The girl looks at Cash talking to Jack...

					JACK
			Im not going back...

		The girl hesitates...Cash turns to her...

					CASH 
				(to the girl)
			Everything okay...?

		She looks at him, a moment of decision, then...

					TEENAGE GIRL
			Yeah...fine.

					JACK
				(raising his voice)
			Hey! Did you hear me...?!

		Cash ignores Jack, watching the girl as she heads to 
		the door, hesitates a moment, then walks out...

		A look of disappointment on Cashs face as he reaches 
		into his pocket, pulling out a little notebook...

		Cash looks at Jack.

					CASH 
				(making a note 
				 in his book)

			That was a character issue...
				(shaking his head)
			...and for nine dollars?  
			Thats just sad...

					JACK
			Hey, Im talking to you!  
			I am not going back, do you 
			understand...?!

		Cash looks at him, compassion on his face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You cant do this. You 
			cant keep coming in and 
			out of peoples lives, 
			messing things up...

					CASH
			Cmon, Jack...

		Jack throws six bucks on the counter...

					JACK
			Ive got kids, Im going 
			home...

					CASH
			You know what the word 
			glimpse means, J? Its 
			by nature an impermanent 
			thing.

		Jack walks determinedly toward the exit. He stops and 
		turns at the door...

					JACK
				(pointing at 
				 Cash)
			Im staying.

		Cash follows him with his eyes, a proud look on Cashs 
		face as Jack leaves...

    111	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, JOSHS ROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack walks to Josh.  Hes sleeping soundly.

		Jack gently kisses Josh on the head, careful not to 
		wake him.

    112	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, ANNIES ROOM - LATE NIGHT

		Jack is standing over Annie, kissing her on the cheek.

					ANNIE
				(stirring, groggy)
			Is it morning yet?

					JACK
			No, honey. Go back to 
			sleep.

		She closes her eyes as Jack stands there for a moment 
		looking at her, sadness all over his face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Take care of yourself,
			Annie.  Im going back to 
			the mother ship...

		Finally, he turns to go...

    113	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		The clock reads, 11:17.  Kate is already in bed as 
		Jack walks in.

					KATE
				(looking up from 
				 her book)
			Hey...

		Jack approaches her, sitting on the bed...

					JACK
			These last weeks, Kate, I 
			know that Ive done 
			some...some unusual 
			things.

		Kate nods.

					KATE
			Its been interesting, 
			thats for sure.

					JACK
			But Ive done some good 
			things too, havent I?

					KATE
			Youve been Jack 
			Campbell.  And thats 
			always a good thing...

		She kisses him on the cheek.

		He takes her arms in his hands and looks her in the 
		eyes.

					JACK
			I need you to remember 
			me, Kate.  How I am right 
			now, right this very 
			moment.  I need you to 
			put that image in your 
			heart and keep it with 
			you, no matter what 
			happens.

					KATE
			Are you okay, Jack?

					JACK
			Please, just promise me 
			youll do that. You have 
			to promise, Kate. 
			Because if you dont, 
			then its like it never 
			happened and I dont 
			think I could live with 
			that.

		Shes a bit confused but she couldnt be more in love 
		with him.

					KATE
			I promise, Jack...

					JACK
			Promise me again...

					KATE
			I promise. Come to bed, 
			honey.

		Jack stands up, heading toward the door.

					JACK
			Soon...

    114	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

		Snow begins to fall...

		Jack with Lucy on a leash, walking side by side, his 
		mind elsewhere...

		Lucy leads him around a corner...to a large open 
		field...

		Lucy stops.  She looks back at Jack, then out to the 
		open field.

		Jack removes the leash. The dog bounds happily out 
		into the field, looking for just the right spot.

		Jack puts his hands in his coat pocket...pulls out a 
		half-eaten roll of PEPPERMINT LIFESAVERS, puts one in 
		his mouth...

		He looks up at the sky, snow gently falling onto his 
		face. Its cold, but its beautiful...peaceful and 
		still...the air clean and crisp...

		He breathes in the fresh air, the Lifesaver dissolving 
		in his mouth, watching the dog...

    115	INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

		The room is dark...

		Jack enters, sees Kate sleeping soundly in bed.

		He sits down in a chair and watches Kate asleep, a sad 
		look in his eyes...

		As he continues to watch her, to listen to her, his own 
		eyelids appear to grow heavy...

		He tries to fight the sleep...opening his eyes...
		focusing on her...but its no use...

		Finally, he closes his eyes...falling into a deep 
		sleep...

		CHAPTER SIXTEEN  THE OLD LIFE

		DISSOLVE TO:

    116	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING

		A PHONE RINGING

		Jack, flat on his back in bed...Light streams onto 
		his face ...he stirs...

		THE PHONE STILL RINGING...

		Jack reaches over to Kates side...theres no one 
		there.

		Pull back to reveal...his old Manhattan apartment... 
		his old dressy clothes strewn on the floor...

		Jack, sleep still in his eyes, reaches over...hes not 
		wearing any pajamas...picks up the phone...

					JACK
				(groggy, dazed)
			Yeah...okay, send her 
			up...

		He drops the phone...turns back over...lets his eyes 
		stay closed for another moment...then...

		His eyes open...

		He looks around...sees his shirtless torso...then his 
		old apartment...tailored clothes on the floor.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(sadly)
			Damnit.

		Jack looks at the clock, 9:23 a.m.  He gets out of 
		bed, throwing on pants and a pair of shoes, and leaves 
		the room...

    117	INT. JACKS APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack walks to the door just as...

		The doorbell RINGS.  He stops, then cautiously opens 
		the door, seeing...

		PAULA, wearing a long overcoat and a wide smile on her 
		face.

					PAULA
			Waiting for me by the door, 
			huh?

		Jack looks at her.

					JACK
			Paula...

		Paula opens her coat  the only thing she has on 
		underneath is a sexy little teddy.

					JACK (CONTD)
				(momentarily 
				  distracted)
			Thats totally see through...

					PAULA
				(smiling)
			Merry Christmas...

					JACK
				(confused)
			Christmas?  It cant be 
			Christmas...

		Jack stares at her, totally confused...

					PAULA
				(lasciviously)
			Its whatever you want it 
			to be, Jack...

		Jack grabs a leather jacket then walks right by a 
		shocked Paula and heads out the door, practically 
		running down the corridor.

					PAULA (CONTD)			
			Jack?...Jack!

		CUT TO:

    118	EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari speeds down the bridge, toward Jersey...

    119	EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - MORNING

		Jacks Ferrari pulls up in the driveway and he hops 
		out. He races to the front door, POUNDING on it...

		A MAN in a Van Heusen shirt and Hagar slacks answers.  
		Jack stares at him in shock.

					MAN
			Can I help you?

					JACK
			Is Kate here? Does Kate live 
			here?!

					MAN
			Kate? No, theres no one here 
			named Kate.  Is that good 
			enough for you?

		Jack starts rapping his head against the door post, 
		much to the shock of the guy standing there.

					JACK
			Damn...damn...damn...

					MAN
			Hey, are you okay?

					JACK
			No...Im not...

					MAN
			Is there anything I can do 
			for you?

		Jack shakes his head mournfully.

					MAN (CONTD)
			Hey, my wifes in the kitchen.  
			You got a cigarette?

					JACK
			Im sorry, no...

		Jack walks off, beleaguered...

    120	EXT. ARNIES HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

		Jacks car drives by as Arnie carries a bicycle box out
		to the garbage.  The car screeches to a halt in front 
		of the driveway.

					ARNIE
				(shouting at Jack)
			Hey, you cant park that 
			thing here.

					JACK
				(out the window)
			Its me, Jack...

					ARNIE
			I dont care if youre Tim 
			Allen with your fancy car 
			and all your tools, you 
			still cant park here.

					JACK
			Tell me you recognize me, 
			Arnie.  Please...

					ARNIE
			Howd you know my name?

					JACK
			We bowl together. Were 
			bowlers ...we won a 
			championship...were winners.

					ARNIE
			I never won anything in 
			bowling.

		Arnie peers at Jack through the window.

					ARNIE (CONTD)
			Wait a second...
				(thinking)
			Jack...Jack...

					JACK
			Yes...Jack Campbell...

					ARNIE
			Of course. Jack Campbell. I 
			went to high school with
			you...you played baseball, 
			right?
				(at the Ferrari)
			Youre doing well...

					JACK
				(remembering)
			Yes, thats it...yes, we 
			went to high school together.

					ARNIE
			You never really talked to 
			me.  I wanted to talk to 
			you, man...

					JACK
			Yeah...I guess I just 
			wanted you to know, we 
			couldve been really good 
			friends...

    120A	INT. FERRARI - DAY

		Jack driving...a CELL PHONE RINGS.

		A curious look on Jacks face, its been a while since 
		hes heard that sound.

					JACK
				(answering phone) 
			Hello?

					ADELLE (O.S.)
			Hey Santa, where are you?  
			Everybodys here.

					JACK
			Adelle?

					ADELLE (O.S.)
			You were supposed to be here 
			half an hour ago...the 
			emergency strategy session?  
			Your trip to Aspen? Theyre 
			all panicked here...

		Silence from Jack...

					ADELLE (CONTD, O.S.)
			Jack...? Are you going through 
			the tunnel?

		Finally, Jack shakes his head, defeated.

					JACK
			Ill be there in twenty 
			minutes...

		CUT TO:

    121	INT. LASSITER BUILDING, CONFERENCE ROOM - NOON TIME

		Its a beehive of activity...

		Jacks TEAM, anxiously going over reports and flow 
		charts, working the phones, drinking coffee...

		Jack enters, still reeling from his experience, taking 
		a moment to observe the action...

		Mintz spots him...

					ALAN
				(into phone)
			Thank god, Jacks here. Ill 
			call you right back...

		He hangs up the phone as all eyes in the room turn to 
		Jack, immediately fixating on how disheveled he looks.

					ALAN (CONTD)
				(approaching)
			Jack, are you okay?

					JACK
				(in a daze)
			Whats going on here?

					ALAN
			Its not good.  Bob Thomas 
			has secretly been talking to 
			a European drug company.  
			Were not sure which one, 
			Julias on it right now.  
			Word is theyre willing to 
			let him buy a minority stake 
			and keep running the entire 
			company.  The Global people 
			are up in arms.  They say 
			we shouldve been prepared 
			for this.  Were in trouble 
			here, Jack...

		Jack looks at Alan for a minute.

					JACK
			You know something, Alan.  
			Theres a much more assertive 
			person somewhere inside of 
			you...

		Alan looks at him, confused.

					ALAN
			Excuse me?

					JACK
			But I think I like you better 
			this way...

					ALAN
			Is this another one of those 
			Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?

		A sad laugh from Jack.

					JACK
			No.

					ALAN
			So what are we gonna do, 
			Jack?

		Jack wallows for another moment in his own sadness...

					ALAN (CONTD)
			Jack...?		 

		Jack snaps out of it, turning to Alan and the rest of 
		the group...

					JACK
			Ill tell you exactly what 
			were going to do.  Youre
			going to do whatever you 
			have to do to find out which 
			European company hes been 
			talking to.  Then Im going 
			to clean myself up, fly to 
			Aspen, and drink egg nog 
			with Bob Thomas.  His wife 
			and kids will be playing in 
			the background while I spend 
			Christmas day convincing him 
			that the European company is 
			the devil and Global is the 
			answer to his prayers, after 
			all...
				(growing wistful)
			Then Im going to spend four 
			hours skiing. Alone. On 
			Christmas day. Completely 
			and utterly alone. Im going 
			to do that because that is 
			my life, that is whats 
			real, and there is nothing 
			I can do to change that...

		Jack leaves the office to the shocked stares of his 
		team.

    122	EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

		Jacks limo makes its way downtown.

    123	INT. LIMO - SAME TIME

		Jack in the back seat of the limo, sadly looking out 
		the window, watching the buildings pass by...

		He turns away, looks at the phone...haltingly picks it 
		up...

					JACK
				(dialing 411)
			For Manhattan...Kate 
			Reynolds...I need an address 
			too...

		Jack jots something down on a business card.  Then he 
		hangs up the phone, thinks a moment, looks out the 
		window, then turns to the driver...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Make a right here...

					DRIVER
			But the airports the other
			way...

					JACK
			Were not going to the 
			airport...

		CUT TO:

		123A	EXT. KATES BUILDING - DAY

		Jacks limo pulls up outside this house on Washington 
		Mews...

		Jack gets out...

    124	INT. EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

		Jack stands outside an apartment door.  He hears The 
		Clashs London Calling BLARING from inside.

		He rings the bell...the volume of the music gets 
		lower...

		Kates assistant, LORI, 20s, opens the door...Jack 
		exchanges a curious look with her.

					LORI
			Are you from the shipping 
			company?

					JACK
			Im Jack Campbell...Im an 
			old... friend of Kates.  
			I just called.

		The woman looks at him, then walks back inside...

					LORI (O.S.)
			Kate! Some guys here!

		Beat. Jack waits anxiously at the door. Then...

					KATE (O.S)
				(to Lori)
			Did you call the airline 
			like I asked?!

		Jacks eyes come alive as Kate appears wearing jeans 
		and a white blouse...except for her hair, she looks the 
		same.

					JACK
			Kate...

					KATE
			Jack...God, its been so 
			long...You look...

		She searches for a kind word, but he looks terrible.

					JACK
			You look great.

					KATE
			Its good to see you...

		She looks at him another moment, then turns...

					KATE (CONTD)
				(yelling inside)
			Lori! Wheres that box?!

		Kate walks inside, Jack follows her in sheepishly.

		125	INT. KATES APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

		...Jack accidentally knocks into a stack of boxes, 
		sending a GLASS CANDY DISH CRASHING to the floor, 
		SHATTERING it...

					JACK
				(bending down)
			I'm sorry...

					KATE
			Dont worry about it, Jack...

		Jack looks up at...a beehive of activity  Lori on the 
		phone, boxes stacked everywhere, TWO MOVERS packing 
		up...

					JACK
			Whats going on?

					KATE
				(searching around)
			Im moving to Paris...it was 
			right here...
				(to Lori)
			Its a box marked Jack.  I 
			put it in the stack for the 
			Salvation Army...

					JACK
			Paris?

					LORI
				(to Kate, with 
				 attitude)
			Do you want me to look for 
			the box or call the airline?

					KATE
			Hey, kind of under a little 
			pressure here.

					LORI
			Hey, kind of giving up 
			Christmas day for my ex-boss 
			here.

		Jack watches this back and forth.

					KATE
			You didnt seem to mind 
			offering to help me on 
			Christmas day when you were 
			unwrapping that Prada bag 
			I gave you.

					LORI
			Maybe its by the wardrobe 
			boxes...

		Kate heads over to some tall wardrobe boxes.

					JACK
			Youre moving...

					KATE
			Uh huh. To Paris. My firm 
			has an office there and 
			Im going to be heading 
			it up.

					JACK
				(stunned)
			To Paris. Paris, France.

					KATE
				(searching the 
				 boxes)
			Thats the one...

					JACK
			So youre not at a non-
			profit firm?

					KATE
				(a chuckle)
			Not with what they pay me...

					JACK
			Youre not married, are 
			you?

					KATE
			No, Jack, I never got 
			married. You?

					JACK
			Not exactly...
				(looking around)
			Can we just take a minute 
			here?  Maybe get a cup of 
			coffee or something...?

					LORI
				(yelling)
			Ill go for a cup of coffee!

					KATE
			Yes!

		A relieved smile from Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			I found it!

					LORI
			Congratulations. The La 
			Guardia flights canceled 
			but I got you out of 
			Kennedy on United at nine.  
			Am I good or what?

		Jacks smile disappears as Kate hands him a sealed box 
		marked, Jack...

					KATE
			Here you go.  Its just 
			some old things of yours...

		Jack stands here, looking at the box, then at Kate...

					JACK
			Do you ever think about us, 
			Kate?  About what might 
			have happened...?

		A bemused LAUGH from Kate.  Then she sees hes not 
		laughing...

					KATE
			Youre serious...

		A nod from Jack...

					KATE (CONTD)
			Ill tell you what, Jack, 
			if youre ever in Paris, 
			look me up. Maybe well 
			go for that cup of coffee.

		One of the movers passes by Jack carrying a box...

		Jack looks at Kate, flush with the realization that 
		this isnt the same woman he knew thirteen years 
		ago, or left yesterday.

					JACK
			Sure. Goodbye, Kate.

		He leaves...

		CUT TO:

		126	INT. JACKS APARTMENT - EVENING

		A scratchy Zeppelin album, the song All Of My Love, 
		fills the room. Jack, a fifth of Bushmills by his 
		side, goes through the box Kate gave him.

		He removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft 
		material, then a Mondale for President button, which 
		Jack smiles upon seeing, a couple Neil Young concert
		ticket stubs...

		He puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale 
		button on the lapel.  He digs back into the box, 
		finding...

		A messy, dog-eared copy of Cats Cradle...not the one 
		Kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced...

		Jack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness... 
		then...

		He looks over at the clock, it reads, 8:29.

		CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  ONE LAST TRY

		CUT TO:

	127	EXT. VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY - NIGHT

		Jack in his Ferrari, racing down the highway at 120 
		MPH...

		He looks at the clock, it reads, 8:46. He opens up 
		the throttle...

	128	EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, UNITED TERMINAL - MINUTES LATER

		Snow is falling as Jacks car races up to the terminal 
		then stops. He jumps out. An AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD 
		sees him...

					AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD
			Hey, you cant leave that 
			there!

		Jack runs into the terminal, ignoring the guard...

	129	INT. UNITED TERMINAL - SECONDS LATER

		Jack looking at the board. The nine oclock to Paris - 
		Gate 8A. Jack sprints toward the gate...

	130	INT. UNITED TERMINAL, GATE AREA - SECONDS LATER

		...and gets there just as the flight is boarding.
		Jack looks through the crowd, spotting Kate near the 
		front of the line, about to hand her ticket to the gate 
		attendant.

		He pushes through the throng of people, drawing some 
		annoyed stares, finally making his way over to Kate.

					JACK
				(calling out)
			Kate!

		Kate turns and sees Jack, a look of puzzlement on her 
		face.

					JACK (CONTD)
			You cant go!

					KATE
			Jesus, Jack...

					JACK
			Dont get on that plane!

					KATE
			Jack.

					JACK
			Please. Lets just go have 
			a cup of coffee. Thats all 
			Im asking for. Im sure 
			theres another flight to 
			Paris tonight.

					KATE
			What do you want from me? 
			You want me to tell you 
			everything that happened 
			was okay?

		Jack just stands there, unsure...

					KATE (CONTD)
			Well it is. Yes, I was 
			heartbroken ...But I got 
			over it. I moved on. 
			People change, Jack. I 
			changed. I dont know 
			why you suddenly feel the 
			need to revisit that time 
			in our lives but I assure 
			you, its over...

		Kate turns her back to Jack, leaving him standing 
		there...

		He watches her walk to the podium, realizing shes 
		right...

		He sees Kate reach the podium...hand her ticket to the 
		attendant...

		Finally, a look of determination crosses his face...

					JACK
				(at Kate)
			We have a house in Jersey!

		Kate turns to him with a look that could kill.

					KATE
			Dont do this, Jack...
			But he continues...

					JACK
			We have two kids, Annie and 
			Josh...

		...Kate looks at him, half-mortified, half-
		interested...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...Annies not much of a 
			violin player but she 
			tries really hard. Shes a 
			little precocious but thats 
			only because she says whats 
			on her mind. And when she 
			smiles...

		Jack shakes his head, remembering, fighting back the 
		tears...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And Josh...he has your eyes. 
			He doesnt say much but we 
			know hes smart...
				(lost in the memory)
			...hes always got his eyes 
			open, always watching us...
			sometimes you can look at 
			him and just know that hes 
			learning something new...
			its like witnessing a 
			miracle...

		Kates expression has sifted from annoyance to 
		curiosity.

					JACK (CONTD)
			...the house is a mess, but 
			its ours...
				(chuckling)
			...well, after a hundred 
			twenty two more payments 
			it will be...

		Jack begins walking slowly toward Kate...the world of 
		the airport going on around him, Jack not caring...

					JACK (CONTD)
			And you...youre a non-
			profit lawyer. Thats right, 
			completely non-profit. But 
			that doesnt seem to bother 
			you...

		Kate raises an eyebrow. Its something shes thought 
		about.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And were in love. After 
			thirteen years of marriage 
			were still unbelievably 
			in love...
				(with a chuckle)
			You wont even let me touch 
			you until Ive said it...

		Jack gets closer and closer...Kates spellbound now... 
		imagining the picture Jacks painting...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...I sing to you...not all 
			the time but definitely on 
			special occasions...

		Jack walks into a piece of carry-on luggage sitting by a 
		row of passengers...

					JACK (CONTD)
				(off hand, to passenger)
			Excuse me...
				(to Kate)
			We made a lot of sacrifices, 
			dealt with our share of 
			surprises, but we stayed 
			together...

		Jacks nearly there...

					JACK (CONTD)
			You see, youre a better 
			person than I am...

		Not in this life, and Kate knows it...

					JACK (CONTD)
			...and it made me a better 
			person to be around you...

		Kate is perfectly still, Jacks words echoing in her 
		ears.

					JACK (CONTD)
			Maybe it was all a 
			dream. Maybe I went to 
			bed one lonely night in 
			December and imagined it 
			all. But I swear, 
			nothings ever felt more 
			real to me...

		Hes right in front of her. She cant take her eyes 
		off him.

					JACK (CONTD)
			And if you get on that 
			plane right now, itll 
			disappear forever.

		Silence. Jack and Kate in their own little 
		world...airport business going on around them...

					JACK (CONTD)
			I know we can both go on 
			with our lives. And wed 
			both be fine. But Ive 
			seen what we can be like 
			together...And I choose 
			us...

		Jacks words resonate in her ears. He gently touches a 
		hand to her arm...

					JACK (CONTD)
			Please, Kate, one cup of 
			coffee. You can always go 
			to Paris. Just please, not 
			tonight...

		She stands there, frozen, staring into Jacks eyes, 
		searching for the answer.

					KATE
			Okay, Jack...

		DISSOLVE TO:

	131	INT. AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT

		Jack and Kate, framed in the window of a nearly empty 
		airport coffee shop...through the window, we see snow 
		falling outside.

		From a distance we see them...TALKING and LAUGHING over 
		a cup of coffee...

		FADE OUT.

          EXT. WOODS. DAY

          An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome
          fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans
          against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing
          on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw.
          He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that
          descends into the valley below.
          A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a
          paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears
          men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches:

                         FOX
          What'd the doctor say?

          MRS. FOX
          Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty-
          four hour bug. He gave me some pills.

                         FOX

                         (REASSURINGLY)
          I told you. You probably just ate some
          bad gristle.
          Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They
          walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the
          path. Fox points:

                         FOX
          Should we take the short cut or the
          scenic route?

          MRS. FOX
          Let's take the short cut.

                         FOX
          But the scenic route is so much prettier.

          MRS. FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          OK, let's take the scenic route.

                         FOX
          Great. It's actually slightly quicker,
          anyway.
          Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a
          quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her
          waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off
          down the scenic route.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

          EXT. FARM. DAY

          A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and
          a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A
          sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from
          the bushes outside a fence.

          MRS. FOX
          What is a squab?

                         FOX
          You know what a squab is. It's like a
          pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of
          bird we can eat.
          Fox motions toward the edge of the property.

                         FOX
          Should we go through the hole under the
          horse fence or climb the rail over the
          bridle path?

          MRS. FOX
          Well, I guess the horse fence would be a
          little safer.

                         FOX
          But the bridle path puts us out right
          next to the squab shack.
          Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods
          nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.

                         FOX
          What's wrong? I've never seen you like
          this. You're acting all skittish. Don't
          worry. I've been stealing birds for a
          living since before I could trot.

          MRS. FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          OK, let's take the --

                         FOX
          No, we'll do the horse fence. You gave me
          the scenic route already.
          Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:

                         FOX
          By the way, you look unbelievably
          beautiful tonight. You're practically
          glowing. Maybe it's the lighting.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          Mrs. Fox is, in fact, glowing, albeit ever so slightly. She
          stares at Fox enigmatically. Fox touches his paw to her
          cheek.
          (NOTE: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this
          shot which can be literally lit from within.)
          With the speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and
          Mrs. Fox: dart through a hole under a painted fence; race
          along a thin trail next to a garage; crawl beneath a window
          where a blonde woman serves an early dinner, dealing
          hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond
          children; creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever
          sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes; and
          shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond,
          bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet, completely
          pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of a wooden
          shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a
          rapid reverse-flip with a flourish.
          Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to Mrs. Fox and puts his
          finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs
          impatiently. They duck inside.
          They come back out. Each holds a dead, bloody pigeon in
          his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up above
          them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his
          mouth and says curiously, pointing toward the sky:

                         FOX
          What's that? I think that's a fox-trap!
          Look at this.

          MRS. FOX
          Get away from there.

                         FOX
          Is it spring-loaded? Yeah...
          (pointing to different spots)
          I guess if you come from over there, and
          you're standing at the door to the squab
          shack, this little gadget probably
          triggers the --
          (gesturing to Mrs. Fox)
          Move out of the way, darling. That's
          right where it's going to land.
          Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm.

          MRS. FOX
          Come on! Stop it! Let's go!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Fox pulls on a little, hanging wire. A chain unrolls rapidly
          from a pulley, and a steel cage falls slap down on top of
          them. A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils. Fox
          and Mrs. Fox stand motionless, side by side, in disbelief.

                         FOX
          No, it just falls straight down right
          here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring-
          loaded.
          Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open,
          voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says

                         QUIETLY:

          MRS. FOX
          I'm pregnant.
          Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He is confused but moved.

                         FOX
          Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey,
          that's great news!

          MRS. FOX
          If we're still alive tomorrow morning, I
          want you to find another line of work.
          Pause. Fox nods.

                         CUT TO:
          A wide shot of the entire valley. There are thick woods,
          green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a
          river running through the middle.

                         TITLE:
          2 YEARS LATER ( 12 Fox-Years)

          EXT. HOLE. DAY

          The entrance to a tunnel under a dirt mound covered with
          holly bushes.

          INT. HOLE. DAY

          A small, comfortable kitchen off a living room with two
          bedrooms behind it. Fox sits at the kitchen table reading a
          newspaper called the Gazette. His fur has gone grey at the
          temples, and he now wears a dark, double-breasted, pin-
          striped suit with a conservative necktie. Mrs. Fox stands at
          the counter-top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.
          She is dressed in a paint-splattered, cream-colored,
          Victorian-style dress.

                         INSERT:
          A column in the newspaper with Fox's picture at the top of
          it. The caption reads: Fox about Town with Fantastic Mr. Fox.

                         FOX
          Does anybody actually read my column? Do
          your friends ever talk about it?

          MRS. FOX

                         (STILL STIRRING)
          Of course. In fact, Rabbit's ex-
          girlfriend just said to me last week, "I
          should read Foxy's column," but they
          don't get the Gazette.
          (yelling into the next room)
          Ash! Let's get cracking!

                         FOX
          Why would they? It's a rag-sheet.

                         (SIGHS)
          I want to say I hate my job, but that
          would make it seem more important to me
          than I want people to think it is.
          Mrs. Fox puts down her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of
          bread. A small, narrow fox cub comes out of one of the
          bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt. His hair is
          smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong. He is Ash.

                         ASH
          I'm sick.

          MRS. FOX
          You're not sick.

                         ASH
          I have a temperature.
          Mrs. Fox goes quickly over to Ash and puts her paw to his
          forehead.

          MRS. FOX
          You don't have a temperature.
          Ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom:

                         ASH
          I don't want to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

          MRS. FOX
          Hurry up. You're going to be late.
          Mrs. Fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast
          and coffee. Fox whispers to her:

                         FOX
          I love the way you handled that.
          Mrs. Fox looks at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash:

          MRS. FOX
          Your cousin Kristofferson's coming first
          thing tomorrow morning. I want you to be
          extra nice to him, because he's going
          through a very hard time right now, OK?
          Ash comes back out of his bedroom. He now wears a white
          cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into
          them. He says aggressively:

                         ASH
          Where's he going to sleep?

          MRS. FOX
          We're going to make a bed for him in your
          room tonight.

                         ASH
          I can't spare the space. Put him in Dad's
          study.
          Fox says without looking up from his newspaper:

                         FOX
          Dad's study is occupied by Dad.
          Ash goes back into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He
          looks around the room. He says to Mrs. Fox:

                         FOX
          I don't want to live in a hole anymore.
          It makes me feel poor.
          Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox and says

                         SOFTLY:

          MRS. FOX
          We are poor -- but we're happy.
          Fox twists his paw in the air, indicating:

          Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are
          better above ground.
          Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of
          coffee. Fox takes her paw and says:

                         FOX
          I'm seven non-fox-years old now. My
          father died at seven and a half. I don't
          want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm
          going to do something about it.
          Fox kisses Mrs. Fox's paw. He suddenly eats three slices of
          toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly. He stands
          and picks up his cup of coffee.

                         FOX
          Well, I'm off.
          Fox throws back the last of his coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on
          the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase, tucks his
          newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts

                         CHEERILY:

                         FOX
          Have a good day, my darlings!
          Ash comes out the bedroom again. He has now added a white
          cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his
          teeth. There is toothpaste all over his mouth. He waves
          briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks
          puzzled.

                         FOX
          What's he wearing?
          Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves
          back. He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded
          up section of his newspaper.

                         INSERT:
          A clipping from the real estate section. There is a
          photograph of a wide, sprawling beech tree at the top of a
          hill. A caption below it reads:

          INT. TREE. DAY

          A door opens into a wide, low space with peeling paint. There
          is an old chair against the wall, a bare light bulb hanging

          from the ceiling, and a layer of dust over everything. A
          skinny weasel in a khaki outfit immediately starts in as Fox
          comes into the living room:

                         WEASEL
          Obviously, it's first growth, indigenous.
          Original dirt floor, good bark, skipping
          stone hearth --
          Weasel is interrupted by a loud banging clank. He and Fox
          peer into the next room. A heavy-set opossum with a cowlick
          tinkers with some pipes under the kitchen sink. He is Kylie.
          Weasel snaps at him:

                         WEASEL
          What'd I tell you? I'm showing the
          property. You're not supposed to be here.

                         KYLIE
          (checking his watch)
          Oh, cuss. What time is it? I'm sorry.
           Weasel sighs. He waves his arm in Kylie's direction and says
          distractedly, slightly annoyed:

                          WEASEL
           This is Kylie. He's the super.
           (aside to Fix)
          He's a little --
          Weasel makes a fluttering gesture with his paw. Fox nods. He
          points at a bucket on the floor next to Kylie among bolts,
          tools, and washers.

                         FOX
          What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?

                         KYLIE

                         (HESITATES)
          Just minnows. You want one?

                         FOX
          Certainly. Thank you.
          Kylie reaches into his bucket and hands Fox a live, wriggling
          minnow. Fox swallows it whole.
          Fox stares out the window at three sprawling poultry
          compounds in the distance. Black smoke pours out of a
          farmhouse chimney on each property. A sign on a water tower
          in the first compound reads Boggis Farms and has a picture of
          a chicken on it. A sign on a silo in the second compound
          reads Bunce Industries and has a picture of a goose on it. A
          sign on a windmill in the third compound reads Bean, inc.

          Weasel says pointedly from across the room:

                         WEASEL
          May I ask what you do for a living, Mr.
          Fox?
          Fox's eyes narrow as he looks out, entranced, with his mouth
          slightly open. He says almost inaudibly:

                         FOX
          I used to steal birds, but now I'm a
          newspaper man.

                         WEASEL

                         (PLEASED)
          Oh, sure. I've seen your by-line.
          Fox snaps out of his reverie and says suddenly:

                         FOX
          Good afternoon, gentlemen.
          Fox shakes hands abruptly with Weasel and starts across the
          room. Weasel is about to ask something when Fox stops in the
          doorway, looks back, and says:

                         FOX
          Oh, and Kylie -- thank you for the
          minnow. It was superb.
          Kylie smiles. Fox exits.

          EXT. RIVER. DAY

          A beaver dam across a bend in a fast stream. A still pond
          sits above it. There is an entrance tunnel tucked beneath a
          rock.

          INT. BEAVER DAM. DAY

          A large room of twig, stick, and mud construction. A card on
          the door reads Badger, Beaver, and Stoat, L.L.P, Attorneys at
          Law. An anxious badger sits at his desk reviewing some
          documents. Fox paces the floor with his hands clasped behind
          his back.

                         BADGER

                         (YELLING)
          Bull-cuss! I'm sugar-coating it, man!
          This is Boggis, Bunce, and Bean! Three of
          the meanest, nastiest, ugliest farmers in
          the history of this valley!
          An uneasy otter secretary peers in at them from the outer
          office. Fox looks intrigued.

                         FOX
          Really? Tell me about them.
          Silence. Badger sighs. He loosens his tie and settles in.

                         BADGER
          All right...

                         CUT TO:
          A fat man with a huge moustache. He wears a tweed suit which
          stretches at the buttons so much that they look like they are
          about to snap off. He holds a carbine rifle. He stands in
          front of his farm, which contains row upon row of chicken
          houses. He has an ugly face. He is Boggis.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          Walter Boggis is a chicken farmer.
          Probably the most successful in the
          world.

          INT. BOGGIS' KITCHEN. DAY

          Boggis sits at a chopping block tearing into a boiled chicken
          with a fork and a meat cleaver.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's unbelievably fat -- which maybe is
          genetic -- but he also eats three boiled
          chickens smothered with dumplings every
          day for breakfast, lunch, supper, and
          dessert. That's twelve in total, per
          diem.

          Boggis' ear. Furry black and white hairs grow out of it. A
          fly buzzes around, lands on it, and crawls inside. Boggis
          sticks his pinky in after it and scratches.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He never takes a bath, as a result of
          which his ear holes are clogged with all
          kinds of muck and wax and bits of chewing
          gum and dead flies and so on.

          wears overalls and a cap. He holds a twelve-gauge shotgun. He
          stands in front of his farm, which consists of several long
          buildings in rows like a factory. He has a nasty face. He is
          Bunce.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          Nathan Bunce is a duck and goosefarmer.
          He owns about 2 million ducksand 500,000
          geese. You might say he's kind ofa pot-
          bellied dwarf of some kind.

          EXT. SWIMMING POOL. DAY

          Bunce stands up to his nose in water. The depth reads 4FT.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's so short his chin would probably be
          under water in the shallow end of any
          swimming pool on the planet.

          INT. BUNCE'S KITCHEN. DAY

          Bunce sits on two stacked telephone books on a chair. He guts
          a dead goose, cutting out its liver and mashing it with a
          fork. A plate of doughnuts cools on the table.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He eats only doughnuts with smashed-up
          goose livers injected into them.

                         CUT TO:
          A tall, skinny man in a long trench-coat. He holds a Luger
          pistol. He stands in front of his farm, which is an apple
          orchard that stretches over thousands of acres. He has a mean
          face. He is Bean.

          INT. BEAN'S SHED. DAY

          Bean works at a moonshine-type cider still, boiling chemicals
          and sipping from a bottle.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's probably anorexic, because he never
          eats anything. He's on a liquid diet of
          strong, alcoholic cider, which he makes
          from his apples. He's as skinny as a
          pencil, as smart as a whip -- and easily
          the biggest cusshole I've ever met in my
          life.

          I understand what you're saying, and your
          comments are valuable, but I'm going to
          ignore your advice.
          Badger leaps out of his chair and slams the office door. He
          points his finger at Fox and screams:

          Fox and Badger begin to snarl and snap savagely, knocking
          into the furniture as they circle around the room pointing in
          each other's faces. Suddenly, they calm down all at once,
          sighing deeply. Pause.

                         FOX
          One last thing: something's probably
          about to happen to me at work which I
          can't put my finger on but have a funny

          Two muskrats in blue electrician's uniforms work in the
          kitchen. Mrs. Fox watches over their shoulders and barks
          orders at them.
          Fox holds up a pair of flowered curtains in front of a
          window. He looks to Mrs. Fox. She stares at the curtains
          thoughtfully. She raises an eyebrow.
          Fox and Mrs. Fox sit in the windowsill looking out at the
          sunset. Ash stands in-between them. The flowered curtains
          wave in the breeze. Fox puffs on a pipe. Ash blows a soap
          bubble. Mrs. Fox puts out her paw and a butterfly lands on
          it. She smiles at Fox. He puts his arm around her. He raises
          a pair of binoculars to his eyes.

          Ash stands poised on a high branch over an inflatable
          swimming pool printed with a red-tartan plaid pattern. He
          wears over-sized swim trunks with a pattern of acorns printed
          on them. Fox sits in the grass eating an apple below with
          Mrs. Fox. She is painting at an easel. Ash yells:

                         ASH
          Watch this, Dad!
          Fox looks up. Ash leaps into the air and does a spectacularly
          awkward back-flip during which he appears to have four arms
          and three legs randomly attached to his body, flailing
          wildly. He hits the water by the side of his head and smacks
          into the surface back-first with a pained yelp. Fox grimaces.
          He claps mildly.

          legs randomly attached to his body will be used for this

          Good jump, Ash! Remember to keep your

          Fox looks at Mrs. Fox's canvas. It is a picture of the pond
          and landscape in severe weather with black clouds and
          lightning bolts. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox raises an
          eyebrow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         FOX
          Still painting thunderstorms, I see.
          Fox sees a small, Samsonite suitcase on the ground next to a
          pair of yellow sneakers. He frowns.

                         FOX
          Whose suitcase is that?
          A boy's voice shouts from the high tree branch:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Hello, everyone! Good afternoon!
          Fox, Mrs. Fox, and Ash look up, surprised. A second Fox cub
          stands poised on the edge of the limb. He is taller, leaner,
          sleeker, and it is immediately apparent even by his posture
          infinitely more graceful than Ash. He is Kristofferson. He
          wears a professional Speedo with a patch on it that says Swim
          Team. Fox brightens.

                         FOX
          Kristofferson! Welcome to our little
          tree! I see you brought your swimming
          trunks!
          Kristofferson steps off the branch and performs a reserved
          but perfect jack-knife. He enters the water splashlessly. Fox
          leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his head,
          whistling and hollering:

                         FOX
          Look at that! This kid's a natural! I'm
          speechless, Kristofferson!
          Kristofferson smiles modestly and shrugs. Ash stares at him
          stonily. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox.

                         FOX
          Plus, he knows karate.

          INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING

          Fox sits in his armchair reading the Gazette. Ash sits on a
          braided rug on the floor beside him reading a comic book
          called The Adventures of White Cape. On the cover, there is a
          picture of a ferret leaping off a motorcycle. Mrs. Fox is in
          the kitchen in the background flattening a hunk of dough with
          a rolling pin. Kristofferson is in the next room practicing
          tae-kwon-do. He wears khaki shorts, yellow sneakers, and a
          blue, short-sleeved, button-down shirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         ASH
          Do you think I'm an athlete?

                         FOX
          (without looking up)
          What are you talking about?

                         ASH
          Well, you know, I think I'm an athlete,
          and sometimes I feel like you guys don't
          see me that way.

                         FOX
          What's the sub-text here?
          Ash thinks for a minute. He looks at Kristofferson in the
          next room. Kristofferson is now sitting Indian-style on the
          floor meditating. His paws are turned upward with his thumbs
          touching his index fingers forming a ring. Ash says loudly to
          Mrs. Fox in the kitchen:

                         ASH
          How long is Kristofferson supposed to
          stay with us?

          MRS. FOX
          Until your uncle gets better.

                         ASH
          Right, but roughly how long do we plan to
          give him on that? Double-pneumonia isn't
          even really that big of a deal, is it?
          In the background, Kristofferson stands up again and starts
          practicing violent karate kicks. Mrs. Fox leans into the
          doorway and whispers forcefully:

          MRS. FOX
          As a matter of fact, it is. He's lucky to
          be alive. Now --

                         ASH
          Right, but --
          Kristofferson yells suddenly as he does a spinning double-
          kick with a chop:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Ki-ya!
          Everyone looks startled. Kristofferson resumes his tae-kwon-
          do practice with an angry, wounded look on his face. Mrs. Fox

                         SAYS COLDLY:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

          MRS. FOX
          Lower your voice, Ash.

          EXT. TREE. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie sit in a porch swing on one of the middle
          branches of Fox's tree. They drink cups of coffee. Crickets
          chirp.

                         FOX
          Kids are crazy, aren't they? You got to
          try it, though. Raising a family.

                         KYLIE
          Yeah. Sometimes I feel like maybe I

                         MIGHT --

                         FOX
          What do you think of this tree, by the
          way? It's great, huh?

                         KYLIE

                         (HESITATES)
          Yeah. No, I was just saying how some-

                         TIMES --

                         FOX
          I have one last part of what I was about
          to say.

                         KYLIE
          OK. Go ahead.

                         FOX
          I'm going broke. You want to help me
          steal some chickens?

                         CUT TO:
          Fox's study, the next morning. A map of the valley with notes
          and arrows written all over it is spread across a desk. The
          door is closed with a towel jammed under it. A cricket match
          plays loudly on the radio. Fox sits in his armchair. Kylie
          sits in a creaky rocking chair.

                         FOX
          I used to do this professionally, and I
          was very successful at it. I had to get
          out of it for personal reasons, but I've
          decided to secretly quit my job slash got
          fired to pursue it again. I'm bringing
          you in as my secretary and personal
          assistant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         KYLIE

          OK!

                         FOX

                         (PRICKLY)
          This is actually kind of a big deal, so
          don't just say, "OK!"

                         KYLIE
          OK. Well, thank you.

                         FOX
          (clearing is throat)
           I'm going totape this formyrecords,so
          don't make a lot of sounds --meaning
          stop rocking.

                         KYLIE

                         (DEFENSIVELY)
          Well, maybe we ought to turn off the
          radio, then. That's noisier than --

                         FOX
          I don't want people to eavesdrop on us,
          Kylie. Let me just tell this.
          Kylie stops rocking. Fox presses record on a tape recorder.

                         HE BEGINS:

                         FOX
          Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.

                         CUT TO:
          That night. Fox stands on a rock at the edge of the woods
          looking through his binoculars. He lowers them and gives a
          hand-signal. Kylie joins him, and they start out along the
          moonlit ridge. Fox wears a dark car-coat and a black cap.
          Kylie has on a navy ski-hat.

          FOX (V.0.)
          We'll start with Boggis' Chicken House
          #1. His only security is a few old
          hunting beagles and a low stone wall. Now
          a word about beagles: never look a beagle
          directly in the eye. And if --

          KYLIE (V.0.)

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          Why not?

          19.
          Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. Kylie

                         SAYS BLITHELY:

                         KYLIE
          Beagles aren't so tough.

                         FOX

                         (ANNOYED)
          Yeah? Well, first of all, one of these
          beagles has chronic rabies, which he's on
          medication for, and if you get bit by him
          you have to get shots in your stomach for
          six months. And, second -- listen, I'm
          not going to justify this to you. Just
          pay attention and stop interrupting me.
          I'm taping this.

          EXT. RAVINE. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie shimmy down a steep embankment and cross a
          stream.

          FOX (V.0.)
          I picked some blueberries, butterflied
          them with a scalpel, and laced each one
          with ten milligrams of high-potency
          sleeping powder.

                         INSERT:
          Fox's paws meticulously sprinkle a powdered mickey into a
          dissected blueberry and stitch it shut with red thread.

           FOX (V.0.)
           Enough to tranquilize a charging gorilla.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now
          smoke pipes.

                         KYLIE
          How do we make them eat it?

                         FOX
          (smiling, with utter certainty)
          Beagles love blueberries.

          EXT. RIDGE. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie push through a bramble and climb to the top of
          an elderberry bush. Fox looks through his binoculars.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

          FOX (V.O.)
          If we approach with the wind in our
          faces, we'll smell the chicken livers on
          Boggis' breath from at least fifty yards
          away.

          EXT. BARNYARD. DAY

          Seventy-five chickens stand around quietly but anxiously,
          darting wildly nervous looks at one another. They eat bits of
          grain off the ground.

          FOX (V.O.)
          Remember: they aren't very smart, but
          they're incredibly paranoid -- so always
          kill a chicken in one bite.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Kylie in Fox's study earlier that afternoon. They now
          drink whiskey sours. Fox repeats:

                         FOX
          One bite, get it?
          Fox waits for Kylie to respond. Kylie does not. Fox frowns.

                         FOX
          Are you listening to me? I look into your
          eyes and I can't tell whether you're
          getting anything I'm saying.
          Kylie stares at Fox vacantly. He shrugs.
          (NOTE: an alternate set of eyeballs will be used for any
          shots indicating Kylie's vacant look.)

          EXT. MEADOW. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie move swiftly through the tall grass. Fox pauses
          to sniff the air. He nods.

                         FOX
          A few beagles, as we discussed, but we're
          ready for that.
          Fox and Kylie cross a dirt lane and come out of a shallow
          ditch. Fox licks the pinky of his paw and holds it up in the
          air.

                         FOX
          You feel that? The wind's in our faces.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
          Kylie touches his face with his paw. He nods. Fox and Kylie
          run along the edge of the ditch. Kylie says casually:

                         KYLIE
          Yeah, back in the old days, didn't they
          used to do a thing where if somebody saw
          a wolf, and --

                         FOX

                         (STARTLED)
          What wolf?
          Fox stops in his tracks. His eyes dart about. Kylie looks at
          him curiously.

                         FOX
          Oh, nothing? Never mind.
          Fox and Kylie veer off into shorter grasses. Fox points
          ahead, regaining his composure:

                         FOX
          Here comes the low stone wall. Not a
          problem.
          Fox and Kylie climb over a low stone wall and find themselves
          at the base of a chain-link fence eleven feet high.

                         FOX
          This is a chain-link fence, I guess. Did
          I not remember this? Maybe it's new.
          Let's pause.

                         (SUDDENLY ANGRY)
          What the cuss? Where'd this giant fence
          come from? We had a master plan!
          Kylie motions to a yellow, plywood lightning bolt posted to
          the fence.

                         KYLIE
          What's this lightning bolt stand for?

                         FOX
          Give me a second! I said, "Let's pause"!
          Pause. Fox pulls himself together. He turns to look at the
          plywood lightning bolt.

                         FOX
          That, I guess, hypothetically, could mean
          maybe this fence might be electric.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         KYLIE
          Well, I just hope it doesn't mean
          thunder. I have a phobia of that.
          Fox and Kylie climb a tree and crouch at the end of one of
          its branches. Fox produces a zip-loc bag filled with
          blueberries with white thread stitched into them.

                         FOX
          Watch this.
          Fox puts a blueberry into the end of a straw and shoots it
          out into the barnyard.

                         CUT TO:
          The blueberry landing on the ground in front of Chicken House
          #1. A beagle approaches it and sniffs at it. He eats it. He
          looks very pleased. He falls over, out cold.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox with an ecstatic expression on his face. He rapidly
          shoots more and more blueberries across the barnyard. Beagles
          eat blueberries and fall over, one after another. Fox and
          Kylie drop down into the barnyard and head for Chicken House
          #1. Fox whispers excitedly as they run:

                         FOX
          Beagles love blueberries! Didn't I tell
          you? The master plan's working again!
          Kylie raises his fist enthusiastically and trips over an
          unconscious beagle. He picks himself up quickly, and they
          weave among the rest of the beagles. They reach the entrance
          to the chicken house, open the door, and duck inside.
          Pause. There is an eruption of crazed squawking, screaming,
          and fighting from inside. The chicken house rumbles. Lights
          jolt on across the compound. An alarm goes off. Voices yell.
          The chicken house door swings open again, and Fox and Kylie
          emerge among a cloud of feathers. Fox carries two dead
          chickens, and Kylie has one live one. Fox yells:

                         FOX
          I said one bite, cuss it!

                         KYLIE
          I'm trying! I have a different kind of
          teeth from you! I'm an opossum!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.
          Kylie tries to bite the chicken on the neck. The chicken is
          unharmed. Kylie shrugs. Fox kills the chicken with one quick
          flick of the jaws. Kylie looks horrified.

                         KYLIE
          That's so grisly! There's blood and
          everything!

                         (DEFENSIVELY)
          We're killing chickens! There's going to
          be blood in this story! Follow me!
          Fox and Kylie dash to the electric fence. They stop in front
          of it. Kylie looks to Fox.

                         KYLIE
          What's the master escape plan?
          Fox hesitates, confused. A gunshot fires from among the
          chicken houses. Fox shouts to Kylie:

                         FOX
          Follow me again!
          Fox and Kylie run back across the barnyard, past the beagles
          as they begin to wake up and stagger around. Farmhands
          appear, loading shotguns and running into the confusion. Fox
          and Kylie race by, unnoticed, among them. They dart into the
          house through a flap in the back door. The lights are out in
          the kitchen. They take a moment, breathing hard in the
          darkness. Kylie shakes his head in disbelief.

                         KYLIE
          Wow. That was amazing. How did we do
          that? We ran the other way or something.

                         FOX
          Yeah.

                         KYLIE
          What happens now?

                         FOX
          I have no idea.
          Fox opens the door-flap a crack. He looks out and sees Boggis
          opening the front gate to let out his beagles and farmhands,
          barking and shooting, as they search for the intruders. Fox
          shouts to Kylie:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         FOX
          Holy cuss! They opened the gate! Follow
          me again!
          Lightning quick, Fox and Kylie burst out through the door-
          flap, race across the barnyard, and dart through the open
          gate. Up the road, Boggis screams furiously as he runs with
          his pack of beagles and farmhands. Fox and Kylie fly into the
          bushes. As they race through the underbrush Fox says

                         BREATHLESSLY:

                         FOX
          Let's hit the five and dime on the way
          home! We need to make some fake price
          tags and wrap these chickens in wax-paper
          so it looks like we got them at the
          butcher shop!
          Fox and Kylie howl ecstatically.

                         MONTAGE:
          A fox's paw lifts a silver dome off a perfectly roasted
          chicken with an apple in its mouth.
          Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at a candle-lit table eating chicken and
          drinking wine. Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at a
          slightly miniature table eating chicken and drinking milk.
          Fox laughs hysterically as he tells his wife a story. Wine
          comes out of his nose.
          Fox and Kylie dash out the door of Boggis' Chicken House #7
          carrying three more dead chickens. Lights jolt on. Farmhands
          run out firing shotguns. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
          cut into the electric fence.
          Fox and Kylie dash out the window of Bunce's Poultry Barn C
          carrying two dead ducks and a goose. Alarms ring. Farmhands
          run out firing pistols. Fox and Kylie escape through a hole
          knocked into a brick wall.
          Fox and Kylie dash out the gates of Bean's Apple Orchard XII
          carrying two dead turkeys and a basket of apples. Automatic
          doors close. Farmhands run out firing rifles. Fox and Kylie
          escape through a hole chopped into a burning barricade.
          Fox and Kylie run full-speed through a clover field in the
          dark. The camera zooms in slowly on their faces as they ford
          a stream, leap a fallen hawthorn, and cross into the willow
          glade. They look exhilarated.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

          INT. KITCHEN. EVENING

          Mrs. Fox studies a crayon price-tag labelled $4 attached to a
          wax-paper-wrapped parcel. She opens the parcel and holds up a
          dead chicken by the leg. There is a small metal clip around
          its ankle. She examines it. She frowns.
          Fox comes in, grabs an apple out of a bowl, and starts back
          out of the room.

          MRS. FOX
          Where'd you get this chicken?

                         FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          I picked it up at the Five-and-Dime last
          night on my way back from --

          MRS. FOX
          It's got a Boggis Farms tag around its
          ankle.

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Huh. Must've escaped from there before I
          bought it.

          INT. DINING ROOM. EVENING

          Ash, Kristofferson, and Kylie sit at the children's table
          eating dinner. Next to Ash, there is a small, slightly beaten-
          up statue of a fox with his front legs raised in the air
          holding a medal above his head. Kylie points at it.

                         KYLIE
          What's that?

                         ASH
          This? Nothing. Just some old trophy I won
          for being an athlete.
          Fox and Mrs. Fox sit at the adults' table. Fox guzzles down a
          last sip of wine and says with his mouth full of food:

                         FOX
          I'm supposed to cover this book party at
          some animal's nest in a tobacco field
          down the hill, so me and Kylie are going
          to hop over there and give it a whirl.
          Don't wait up.
          Fox pulls his napkin out of his collar, drops it on the
          table, and stands up. Mrs. Fox asks cooly:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          MRS. FOX
          What's the book?

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Some memoir. I'll get him to sign you a
          copy.
          Fox kisses Mrs. Fox on the cheek. She looks at him
          suspiciously.

                         FOX
          Dinner was --
           (doing a little gesture)
          -- pitch-perfect.

          EXT. WOODS. NIGHT

           Fox and Kylie walk among the trees. They are dressed in their
          prowling outfits.

                         FOX
          I spotted a couple of broken burglar bars
          underneath the back door to Bean's secret
          cider cellar.

                         KYLIE
          We're breaking into Bean's house?

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Cellar.

                         KYLIE
          Where he lives?

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Where he keeps the cider.

                         ASH

                         (BRIGHTLY)
          Below where he lives.
          Ash, dressed in his own prowling outfit, is walking with Fox
          and Kylie. Fox stops short:

                         FOX
          Where'd you come from? Go back to the
          tree and do your homework!

                         ASH
          I want to help you steal some cider.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         FOX

                         (ANGRILY)
          We're going to a book party! And keep
          your mouth shut about any cider, because
          no one ever said that! Get out of here!

                         ASH
          But Dad --

                         FOX
          But nothing! You're going to get me in a
          lot of trouble!
          The three animals stand in silence for a minute. Fox points
          to his tree. Ash turns and starts back home. Fox shakes his
          head.

                         FOX
          Where the cuss does that kid get off? Can
          you believe that? How'd he get tipped
          off? You think he's going to tell on us?
          Fox turns to Kylie. Kylie looks back at him vacantly.

                         FOX
          Before we go any further, from now on can
          you give me some kind of signal once in a
          while just so I know any of this is
          getting through to you?
          Pause. Kylie makes a slight motion with his paw. Fox
          hesitates.

                         FOX
          Was that it? OK.

          EXT. BARNYARD. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie dart across the yard and around the back of
          Bean's farmhouse. Kylie whispers as they run:

                         KYLIE
          One time this wolf --

                         FOX

                         (IRRITATED)
          What's with all the wolf talk? Can we
          give it a rest, for once?
          Fox climbs onto a garbage pail and pulls open a window
          shutter. He and Kylie shimmy in-between two bent burglar
          bars.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

          INT. BEAN'S SECRET CIDER CELLAR. NIGHT

          A vast, damp, gloomy cellar with hundreds of glass jars
          stacked from floor to ceiling. Each jar is marked Cider. Fox
          and Kylie come inside and quietly drop to the brick floor.

                         KYLIE WHISPERS:

                         KYLIE
          Look at all this apple juice.

                         FOX

                         (STERNLY)
          Apple juice? Apple juice? We didn't come
          here for apple juice. This is some of the
          strongest, finest alcoholic cider money
          can buy -- or that can even be stolen. It
          burns in your throat, boils in your
          stomach, and tastes almost exactly like
          pure, melted gold.

                         (SUDDENLY)
          Let's crack open one these 'shine jars
          and do a shooter.
          A match strikes in the darkness. Fox and Kylie look around
          the room frantically. On the highest shelf, peering out from
          behind a huge jar, they see an enormous rat in a striped
          shirt with a lit match in his claw. He puts the flame in his
          mouth to snuff it out and holds the matchstick in his teeth.
          He is longer than a fox and wiry, but with a small pot-belly.
          He wears a black beret and moves like a beatnik.
          He takes a draw from a small rubber tube inserted in the neck
          of his cider jar. He says with a slightly sinister New

                         ORLEANS ACCENT:

                         RAT
          Y'all are trespassin', now. Illegally.
          'Round these parts, we don't take kindly
          to cider poachers.
          Fox and Rat stare at each other. Fox says, finally:

                         FOX
          You've aged badly, Rat.

                         RAT
          You're gettin' a little long in the
          tooth, yourself, partner.
          Rat spins around and hurls himself scuttling over a shelf,
          down the wall, and through the air onto the brick floor at
          Fox's feet. He flicks open a switchblade and brandishes it.
          He hisses.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Kylie shrieks and darts into a hole where a brick is missing
          in the wall. Fox takes an old-fashioned boxing stance.

                         RAT
          How's your old lady doin'?
          Kylie peers out from his hole in the wall nervously. Fox and
          Rat circle each other slowly.

                         FOX
          Do you refer to my wife?

                         RAT
          She was the town tart, in her day. Wild
          and foot-loose and pretty as a mink
          stole. She was a creme brulee -- until
          you made an honest woman out of her, Mr.
          Fox.
          Kylie says, intrigued, from his hole:

                         KYLIE
          Is that true?

                         FOX

                         (ANNOYED)
          Of course, not. I mean, certainly, she
          lived. We all did. It was a different
          time. Let's not use a double-standard.
          She marched against the --

                         KYLIE
          But town tart?

                         FOX
          Shut up.
          Rat lunges at Fox with his switchblade. Fox dodges nimbly. He
          cocks an eyebrow and smiles:

                         FOX
          That was close, Rat. Be careful.

                         RAT
          Oh, I'm as careful as a --
          A door at the top of the stairs opens suddenly with a loud
          creak. Rat and Fox look terrified. They both dart away and
          hide behind cider jars.
          A heavy-set, middle-aged housekeeper carrying a rolling pin
          comes down the stairs and walks straight over to the shelf
          where Fox is hiding.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         HOUSEKEEPER
          How many jars should I bring up, ma'am?
          A strong, almost masculine woman's voice answers from

                         UPSTAIRS:

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          I don't know. Two, I guess.
          The housekeeper grabs the two jars directly next to the one
          Fox is hiding behind and tucks them under her arm. Fox tenses
          his body. He shivers slightly. A graze of the red fur of his
          arm sticks out barely from behind his jar. The housekeeper
          hesitates.

                         HOUSEKEEPER
          He drank three yesterday, ma'am.

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          All right, take three.
          The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar. Fox closes his eyes.

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          No, don't.
          The housekeeper stops with her hand on the neck of Fox's jar.

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          Three's too many. It's unhealthy. He's
          anorexic. Bring two.
          The housekeeper lets go of Fox's jar. Fox relaxes slightly.
          The housekeeper grabs Fox's jar again. Fox tenses up.

                         HOUSEKEEPER
          But maybe, just in case --

                         MASCULINE VOICE
          Two's plenty.
          The housekeeper lets go of Fox's jar and walks away. She goes
          back up the stairs and closes the door. Kylie says in the

                         DARKNESS:

                         KYLIE
          Oh, my cuss. That was like a scene out of

                         A --
          The door opens again. An exceptionally tall, powerfully built
          woman in a black dress and Wellingtons, with grey hair pulled-
          back in a bun, bright green eyes, and a meat cleaver tucked
          under her apron strings comes swiftly down the stairs. She

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          eyeballs the corners of the room. She is Mrs. Bean. She says
          thickly (in her masculine voice):

          MRS. BEAN
          To whom it may concern: if I catch a rat
          in a black beret drinking Mr. Bean's
          secret cider without his express
          permission, I intend to chop said rat's
          head off, brine it, pickle it, and bake
          it in a vermin casserole. I hope this
          clarifies my position on the matter.
          Sincerely, Evelyn Bean.
          Mrs. Bean turns and goes back up the stairs. She closes the
          door. Pause. Rat's voice says from the shadows:

                         RAT
          Dear Mrs. Bean, your language, while
          somewhat purple, is nevertheless
          impossible to misinterpret. However --
          comma -- given the proximity of said rat
          at the moment of your --
          The door at the top the stairs opens again. Silence.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Kylie running away from Bean's farmhouse with two
          jars of cider. They both look badly shaken. A gunshot rings
          out taking us to:

          EXT. BEAN FARMS. NIGHT

          Bean is standing darkly in his front doorway. Smoke drifts
          from the end of his Luger, pointed at the ceiling. A broken
          light bulb hangs from a wire above his head. Boggis and Bunce
          sit together on the porch in rocking chairs, startled,
          staring at Bean.

                         BEAN
          I'm going to give a speech, and at the
          end of it -- I'm going to throw a twist
          into this plot.
          Bean lights a cigarette and begins to walk slowly around the
          porch.

                         BEAN
          First truth: this is the most ambitious
          fox we've ever encountered, bar none.
          Bean spins around and shoots out a second light bulb. Boggis
          and Bunce look uneasy. Bean continues:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         BEAN
          Second truth: the meaning of ambition is
          defined in the dictionary.
          Bean jumps and rolls and shoots out a third light bulb.

                         BEAN
          Third truth: the weakness of the
          ambitious man is his Achilles heel --
          Bean quickly shoots out three more light bulbs behind his
          back, over his shoulder, and between his legs. The porch goes
          dark. He flicks on a flashlight and points it in his two
          colleague's faces. They look scared. Bean says urgently:

                         BEAN
          -- but I've already figured out where
          this fox lives, and tomorrow night we're
          going to camp in the bushes, wait for him
          to come out of the hole in his tree, and
          shoot the cuss to smithereens. How's that
          grab you, fellas?
          Boggis and Bunce hesitate. They nod and murmur their
          approval.

          INT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie come quietly into the half-lit kitchen dressed
          in their prowling outfits. They walk to the door.

          MRS. FOX
          Another book party?
          Fox and Kylie turn around, startled. Mrs. Fox sits on a stool
          in the darkened pantry.

                         FOX
          Woah! I didn't see you. Sitting in the
          dark over there. Yeah, no. Actually,
          there's a fire. I just got the call. They
          said maybe it's arson? I got to interview
          the marshall and see what's --

          MRS. FOX
          Kylie, is he telling the truth?

                         KYLIE

                         (FREAKING OUT)
          I don't want to be put in the middle of
          this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          Thanks, Kylie.

          MRS. FOX
          If what I think is happening is

                         HAPPENING --

                         (OMINOUSLY)
          -- it better not be.

                         CUT TO:
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting crouched in the bushes. Bean
          licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of the
          wind. He nods, points to his nose, and gives a thumbs-up to
          Boggis and Bunce.

          EXT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT

          Fox pokes his head up out of his hole. He sniffs once. He
          moves an inch forward and stops. He sniffs again. He waits a
          moment and listens. He steps out of the hole and says

                         STONILY:

                         FOX
          Nice job covering for me. Next time

                         TRY --
          A twig snaps. Fox freezes.

                         CUT TO:
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean frozen in the bushes.

                         CUT TO:
          The branches of the trees as the wind suddenly changes its
          direction.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox on high alert. He rapidly sniffs the air three times in a
          row. He turns to a confused Kylie and says, panicking:

                         FOX
          All three!
          Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes. A
          barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark.
          Silence.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          Smoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air.
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean approach the tree. Bean shines his
          flashlight on Fox's hole.
          In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered, blood-
          stained remains of Fox's tail. Bean picks it up and holds it
          in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce.

                         BEAN
          We got the tail, but we missed the fox.
          Pause. Bean takes out his walkie-talkie.

                         BEAN
          Petey? You and the boys sober up and get
          out here on the A.S.A.P. Bring eleven
          shovels, three pick-axes, 500 rounds of
          ammunition, and a bottle of apple cider.

          INT. FOX'S TREE. NIGHT

          Mrs. Fox licks the stump of Fox's tail and mends it with
          gauze and medical tape. She looks furious. Kylie and the Fox
          cubs watch, concerned. Ash says uncertainly:

                         ASH
          It'll grow back, won't it?

                         KYLIE
          (shaking his head)
          Tails don't grow back, except for
          lizards.

                         FOX

                         (MISERABLY)
          Tails don't grow back. I'm going to be
          tail-less for the rest of my life.

                         ASH

                         (NERVOUSLY)
          Well, anyway, it's not half as bad as
          double-pneumonia, right?
          (pointing to Kristofferson)
          His dad's got one foot in the grave and
          one foot on a banana peel. That's a lot
          worse than --
          Kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto the floor. It
          ricochets off a wall and into a teacup. Everyone falls
          silent. Kristofferson turns away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Excuse me, everyone. I'm going to go
          meditate for half an hour.
          Kristofferson walks out of the room. Mrs. Fox looks at Ash
          and says angrily:

          MRS. FOX
          You've got twenty-nine minutes to come up
          with a proper apology.
          Ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and stares
          straight ahead into space grimly. Fox says suddenly:

                         FOX
          What's with the crazy outfit? Why a cape
          and the pants tucked into your socks?
          Ash does not respond. Fox sighs. Mrs. Fox finishes bandaging
          his tail. Fox goes over to the wall and stands with his back
          to the room.

                         FOX
          I got fired slash quit the Gazette and
          started stealing chickens on the sly.

          MRS. FOX

                         (ICILY)
          That tail was the first thing I ever
          noticed about you. It was easily the most
          attractive tail for at least 50 miles in
          every direction. It was probably your
          single best quality -- and now it's gone
          forever.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox lying in bed staring at the ceiling in the dark next to
          Mrs. Fox.

                         FOX
          Why the cuss didn't I listen my lawyer?
          At this point we'll be lucky if we can
          flip this tree for half of what we've
          already sunk into it.
          Fox flips over onto his stomach.

                         FOX
          I won't be able to sleep on my back for
          six weeks -- and on my stomach I feel
          congested. Why the cuss didn't I listen
          to my lawyer?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

          MRS. FOX

                         (BITTERLY)
          Because you don't listen to anybody.

                         FOX
          (sitting up suddenly)
          What was that?

          MRS. FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          What? I said --
           There is a quiet scraping sound from above. Fox jumps out of
          bed. He hollers:

                          FOX
           Wake up! Everybody! They're digging us
          out!
          There is a scrunch and then a loud thump from above. Mrs. Fox
          looks at Fox intensely:

          MRS. FOX
          They'll kill the children!

                         FOX

                         (STEELY)
          Over my dead body, they will.

          MRS. FOX

                         (ANGRILY)
          That's what I'm saying! You'd be dead,
          too, in that scenario!

                         FOX

                         (ANGRILY)
          Well, I'm arguing against that!

          MRS. FOX

                         (SCREAMING)
          What are you talking about?

                         FOX

                         (SCREAMING)
          Why are you yelling at me?

                         KYLIE

                         (AGONIZED)
          Stop! Stop! Stop!
          Fox and Mrs. Fox turn quickly to Kylie standing in the
          doorway with a red blanket wrapped around his shoulders. Ash

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          and Kristofferson stand behind him. They look terrified.
          Kylie shouts in a pained voice:

                         KYLIE
          You say one thing, she says another, and
          it all changes back again!
          The point of a shovel pierces the ceiling. Everyone looks up
          and stares in shock. Fox suddenly leaps across the room with
          a wild energy, scrambles halfway up a wall, and throws over
          two chairs.

                         FOX
          I've got it! There's not a moment to
          lose! Why didn't I think of this before?

          MRS. FOX
          Think of what?

                         FOX
          Think of the one thing a fox does quicker
          than a man, quicker than any other animal
          in the world!
          (at the top of his lungs)

          DIG!!!

                         CUT TO:
          Everyone digging furiously. Dirt flies everywhere. The shot
          booms down into the ground, among the roots of the tree,
          through buried pebbles, layers of soil, and subterranean
          mineral deposits.

                         TITLE:

                         1 HOUR LATER
          The shot stops at the bottom of a dark hole deep, deep
          underground. Mrs. Fox lies on the floor, breathing heavily,
          with a lit lantern at her side. The cubs are sprawled out
          around her. Kylie leans in the corner with his shirt off tied
          around his waist. Fox stands up and clears his throat.
          Everyone looks at him.

                         FOX
          I think it's time for me to give us a pep
          talk and explain some things.
          (commencing a speech)
          A very long time ago --

          MRS. FOX
          May I have a word with you privately?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          Well, we're in a hole. Where --

          MRS. FOX
          Just on the other side of this mineral
          deposit. Follow me.
          Fox reluctantly follows Mrs. Fox through a crack in the
          bedrock and into a small air-pocket with glittering quartz
          walls. She wheels on Fox:

          MRS. FOX
          I'm going to lose my temper now.

                         FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          When?

          MRS. FOX
          Right now.

                         FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          Well, when --
          Mrs. Fox scratches Fox across the face, slicing a quick
          sliver into his fur. Fox cringes away with his paws up
          protectively. He lowers his paws. His eyes fill with tears.
          (NOTE: the scar in Fox's fur never grows back.)
          Mrs. Fox takes a deep breath. She says:

          MRS. FOX
          Twelve fox-years ago, you made a promise
          to me while we were caged inside that fox-
          trap that, if we survived, you would
          never steal another chicken, goose,
          turkey, duck, or squab, whatever they
          are. I believed you. Why did you lie to
          me?

                         FOX

                         (SIMPLY)
          Because I'm a wild animal.

          MRS. FOX
          You're also a husband and a father.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         FOX

                         (PAINED)
          I'm trying to tell you the truth about
          myself.

          MRS. FOX
          I don't care about the truth about
          yourself.
          Fox looks down at the ground. He nods and tries to contain
          his emotions. Mrs. Fox watches him coldly.

          MRS. FOX
          This story is too predictable.

                         FOX

                         (SURPRISED)
          Predictable? Really? What happens in the
          end?

          MRS. FOX

                         (QUIETLY)
          In the end, we all die -- unless you
          change.
          Mrs. Fox walks out of the air-pocket. Fox stands alone in
          silence.

          EXT. FOX'S TREE. DAY

          The next morning. There is a large hole in the side of the
          hill, under Fox's tree. The ceiling to the living room has
          been completely removed. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand half-
          underground with their heads sticking out of the hole,

          Three yellow and black, murderous, brutal bulldozer digging-
          tractors with Malloy Consolidated painted on the sides of
          them. They make a terrible, high-pitched growling noise and
          spit black grease and smoke.
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand among the tractors nodding
          giddily to each other. They scramble into the drivers' seats
          and begin ripping into the hillside. Bunce sits on a
          dictionary to see over the dashboard.

          Bean throws his tractor into top gear. The teeth of the giant

          roots.

          The tractors almost completely below ground in a deep crater.
          A crowd of neighbors and local press from the town has
          gathered and watches as the tractors stop digging and rumble
          up out of the crater. The motors go quiet. Boggis, Bunce, and
          Bean climb down from their tractors. They look angry and
          tired. They stand among the workers and onlookers.

          EXT. CAMP. NIGHT

          There is a full moon. Lanterns glow in the farmers' tents. A
          group of farmhands sit around a campfire next to the crater.
          One of them cooks a chicken on a spit. Another sits on a log
          playing a banjo. He is Petey. He sings:

                         PETEY
          'Bout a handsome little fox
          Let me sing you folks a yarn.

          Full of wit 'n' grace 'n' charm.
          Say, zippy-zee, yappy-yo, google-gum!
          The shot moves past the leathery faces of the other farmhands
          as they listen: amused, moved, hungry, tired, charmed,
          annoyed, whistling, playing a jew's harp, trying to sing
          along but not really knowing the words, etc.

                         PETEY
          Like any little critter needin'
          Vittels for his littl'uns,
          Well, he stole, and he cheated,
          And he lied to survive.

          Dug as quick as a gopher

          Petey stops short. Everyone turns quickly and sees Bean
          standing over them in the darkness with his Luger in one hand
          and a cigarette in the other. Petey looks nervous.

                         PETEY
          I don't know. I was just kind of making
          it up as I was going along...
          Petey trails off. Bean shakes his head. He looks highly
          irritated.

                         BEAN
          That's just weak song-writing! You wrote
          a bad song, Petey!
          Bean throws his cigarette into the campfire. He storms away.
          Petey turns to the other farmhands. Everyone looks
          uncomfortable.

          completely dehydrated and starve to
          death.

                         ASH
          What's that?
          Ash points. Everyone looks. A tiny hole appears in the wall
          at the end of the tunnel. Dirt crumbles out of it -- and a
          bit of metal catches a glint. Fox and his family watch,
          frozen. A breath of air blows into the tunnel.
          The flame on Mrs. Fox's lantern flickers once and goes out.

                         ASH STARTS:

          Not a sound!
          Silence. There is a sudden, loud scrabbling noise. A match
          strikes. Fox touches it to Mrs. Fox's lantern-wick.
          The tiny hole in the wall has become a large one. Badger
          stands in front of Fox with his law partner Beaver, Beaver's
          overgrown, hulking son, a medium-sized mole, and a grey field
          mouse with a bandana tied in a "do-rag" style around his
          head. Badger has a spoon in his hand. Fox and Badger erupt at
          each other, screaming simultaneously:

                         FOX
          You scared the cuss out of us!

          We're all cussing starving to death
          because of you, you mangy, cussing,
          little cuss!
          Fox and Badger snarl and scratch at each other, circling
          around the hole. They calm down slightly. Badger continues:

                         BADGER
          We've been digging in circles for three
          days. Half the woods've been obliterated.
          Nobody can get out. Right now my wife's
          huddled at the bottom of the flint-mine
          with Mrs. Mole, Mrs. Beaver, Rabbit's ex-
          girlfriend, no food, no water, and twenty-
          seven hungry, whining, starving, little
          animal brats. This is a total cluster-
          cuss for everybody!
          Fox looks around the room at the entire gaunt, dirty,
          emaciated assembly. Everyone stares at him angrily. He
          swallows. The mole says softly.:

                         MOLE

          Beaver's son looms over Ash and Kristofferson in a muddy
          alcove on the side of the tunnel. He pokes Ash in the chest
          with the finger of his paw.

          We don't like you, and we hate your dad.
          You're too snazzy. You dress like a girl.
          You're creative. Now grab some of that
          mud, chew it in your mouth, and swallow
          it.

                         ASH
          (scared and disgusted)
          I'm not going to eat mud!

                         BEAVER'S SON
          Cuss, yeah, you are.
          Beaver's son grabs a handful of mud, smashes it into Ash's
          mouth, and forces his jaws up and down in a chewing motion.
          Ash coughs and splutters. Kristofferson frowns. He takes off
          his shoes with his feet. He says with a quiet ferocity:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Don't do that.
          Beaver's son looks to Kristofferson. He looks down at
          Kristofferson's feet.

                         BEAVER'S SON
          Why'd you take your shoes off?

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          So I don't break your nose when I kick
          it.
          Kristofferson kicks Beaver's son in the face, karate chops
          his neck, elbow-jabs him twice in the gut, and flips the
          enormous youth over his shoulder and into the mud. Beaver's
          son gets up, crying, and walks out of the alcove.
          Ash watches blankly with mud all over his mouth as
          Kristofferson puts his shoes back on.

                         ASH
          I can fight my own fights.
          Badger and Fox stand facing each other at the end of the
          tunnel. Badger says aggressively:

                         BADGER
          Those farmers aren't going to quit until
          they've got you and every member of your
          family nailed upside-down to a bloody
          stick with your eyes gorged out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         FOX

                         (FREAKED OUT)
          This is getting a little too personal.
          Badger waits for Fox to continue. Fox stares into space.

                         FOX
          Give me a minute.
          Fox turns and walks away. He faces the wall of the tunnel. He
          sits down on a rock. Everyone watches him uncertainly. They
          look at each other. Badger starts to say something, but Kylie
          cuts him off sharply:

                         KYLIE

                         (SHARPLY)
          Shh!
          Badger falls silent. Fox sits with his chin on his paw, lost
          in concentrated thought. He stands up. He nods repeatedly and
          begins to pace. His eyes dart from one spot to another. His
          paws move abruptly around in the air drawing lines and
          shapes. He freezes and looks straight up at the ceiling of
          the tunnel. He snaps the fingers of his paw and looks to the
          others. He says with a cautious excitement:

                         FOX
          I've got an idea.

                         BADGER

                         (TENTATIVELY)
          What is it?

                         FOX
          It could be a good one.

                         BEAVER

                         (POINTEDLY)
          Lay it on us.

                         FOX
          It might save our lives.

                         KYLIE

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Say the idea!
          Fox looks down at Ash, who stands beside him with mud still
          on his mouth. He nods. He says suddenly:

                         FOX
          All right! Let's try it!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          Fox runs over to Mrs. Fox:

                         FOX
          Go to the flint-mine. Tell Mrs. Badger,
          Rabbit's ex-girlfriend, et al. that help
          is on the way.

          MRS. FOX

                         (SKEPTICALLY)
          Is help on the way?
          Fox grips Mrs. Fox's paw. He looks into her eyes and says

                         INTENSELY:

                         FOX
          I sure as cuss hope so.
          Mrs. Fox detects a special, familiar, inspired light in her
          husband's eyes at this moment. She nods. She hands Ash the
          lantern. She straightens the neck-line of his cape, licks the
          mud off Ash's snout, and scrambles away down Badger's tunnel.
          Ash wants to cry but does not. Fox turns to the others.

                         FOX
          Gentlemen, this time we must dig in a
          very special direction.
          Fox feels the walls with his paws. Everyone watches
          attentively.

                         FOX
          I got to kind of feel out the vibe.
          Fox stops. He points slightly downwards and due south. He
          says with quiet anticipation:

                         FOX
          Begin.
          Everyone starts digging, slowly but intently.

                         CUT TO:
          The diggers one hundred yards later. Fox suddenly whistles
          and raises his fist.
          The diggers stop digging. Fox feels the ceiling with his
          paws. He knocks something hard. It sounds hollow. He looks at
          the others with a funny expression and raises an eyebrow.
          Fox carefully pushes up a floorboard. It creaks loudly. They
          all duck down and wait. Nothing happens. Fox pushes up a
          second floorboard. He cautiously pokes his head up through

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          the gap. He lets out a shriek of excitement and whispers
          excitedly down to the others:

                         FOX
          I've done it! I've done it, first time!
          Come up and see where you are, my
          darlings!
          Everyone scrambles up out of the tunnel.

          INT. SHED. NIGHT

          Everyone stands in the middle of Boggis' Chicken House #1.
          The room is teeming with chickens, which stare at them
          nervously. There are black chickens, white chickens, brown
          chickens, and one that combines all three colors. Fox

                         WHISPERS:

                         FOX
          I hit it slap in the middle! Do you get
          how incredible this is?
          The others nod. They look dazed and wild. Fox holds up his
          hands and whispers:

                         FOX
          Don't lose your heads, now. Let's do this
          properly. First, everyone have a drink of
          water.
          Fox leads the others over to the chickens' drinking trough.
          They all lap up the cool water. Fox dries his mouth.

                         FOX

                         SECOND --
          Fox seizes a black chicken violently.

                         CUT TO:
          Ash and Kristofferson running down the tunnel carrying two
          dead, black chickens. They turn three corners and arrive at
          the mossy hollow. They look inside.

                         MONTAGE:
          Fox and the other diggers tunnel under the silo in front of
          Bunce Industries. Cows eat grass in the pasture above.
          Fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor
          and dance an ecstatic jig in a great storeroom lined to the
          ceiling with plucked ducks and geese. Smoked hams and sides
          of bacon dangle from the rafters.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          Fox and the other diggers tunnel under the windmill in front
          of Bean, inc. Sheep eat clover in the field above.
          Fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor
          and dance an ecstatic jig in a corrugated plastic and metal
          pen among dozens of gobbling turkeys.
          Fox and the other diggers race dancing ecstatically back
          through the complex network of tunnels carrying dead turkeys,
          geese, bacon, flour, salt, sugar, jars of cider, and a
          portable television set.

          INT. FLINT-MINE. DAY

          The flint-mine is a large but cozy space with stone walls, a
          dirt floor, a small kitchen, and a fireplace. There are rows
          of cots, sleeping bags, boxes, blankets, and suitcases for
          all the refugee animals. All the animals have gathered
          together and drink cider cocktails while small rabbits,
          skunks, and field mice set the table. The room is festooned
          with garlands. A well-dressed mole smoking a pipe plays the
          piano. A bespectacled rabbit leans against it humming a tune.
          Weasel stands in the corner talking with Beaver.

                         WEASEL
          What am I going to do? I'm going to hold
          him to the terms of the contract. It's
          not my fault they uprooted it.
          Kristofferson serves cranberry punch from a tureen in the
          corner. Ash goes over to him and holds out a mug.

                         ASH
          They say I owe you an apology for some of
          the mean things I said about your
          father's illness. His double-pneumonia or
          whatever they're calling it now.
          Kristofferson ladles Ash a cupful.

                         KRISTOFFERSON

          OK.

                         ASH
          So there it is. I hope we can continue
          our relationship as cousins or family
          members or however you want to define

                         IT --
          (suddenly more intense)
          -- but do me a favor for yourself. The
          next time you have a problem with
          something I've said, come to me as a fox

                         ASH (CONT'D)
          and let's deal with it right then and not
          let it blow up into a whole, huge thing
          involving parents and so on. Agreed?
          Ash drinks his punch in one long sip and holds out the empty
          mug for a refill. Kristofferson nods slowly. He points at Ash
          with his ladle.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          I'm going to teach you karate.
          Badger sits next to the fireplace with Fox and Kylie.

                         BADGER
          I can imagine how painful, even just
          emotionally, that must be for you.

                         FOX

                         (UNEASY)
          Well, you know, it's not the end of the
          world.

                         BADGER

                         (MORE ANIMATED)
          Oh, but, Foxy, how humiliating! Having
          your whole tail blown clean off by a --

                         FOX

                         (COOLY)
          Can we drop it?
          Kristofferson starts to refill Ash's mug again. Ash suddenly
          puts his paw over the brim. Kristofferson hesitates. Ash
          raises an eyebrow and says mysterriously:

                         ASH
          Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean's famous
          nutmeg-ginger-apple snaps?

          EXT. CAMP. DAY

          A large fire truck drives up to the destroyed hill with
          firemen hanging off the back and sides. It parks among the
          tractors and tents. The chief, in a white helmet, goes over
          to Boggis, Bunce, and Bean waiting at the mouth of the pit. A
          patch on his sleeve says O.W.F.R.P.F. Farmhands and firemen
          circle around.

                         CHIEF
          Who's got me a donation for the old
          Wounded Fireman's Retirement Pension
          Fund?
          Bean pulls a yellow check out of his inside pocket.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         BEAN
          Right here.
          (pointing behind him)
          Let me show you this hole.

          INT. FLINT-MINE. DAY

          Candles glow all around. Everyone is seated at the long
          dining room table, and a magnificent feast with every variety
          of fruit, meat, vegetable, and roasted bird has been laid out
          in front of them. They tear into their meals, eating and
          drinking ferociously. Crumbs, juices, blood, and bones fly
          into the air. Jaws snap and chew. There is no conversation.
          Badger suddenly stands and rings a knife against his cider
          glass. Everyone looks up, taking a breather from the frenzy
          of eating. Badger clears his throat.

                         BADGER
          Well, it took a near-catastrophe for all
          of you to finally take me up on my offer
          to have you over to the flint-mine for
          dinner, but I guess we have --

                         FOX

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          I'm sorry. Maybe my invitation got lost
          in the mail. Does anybody know what this
          badger's talking about?
          Everyone laughs. Fox sits at the opposite end of the table
          with a crooked smile on his face.

                         FOX
          But Clive's right --

                         (STANDING UP)
          -- in all seriousness --
          (aside, to Badger)
          -- excuse me, B.
          Fox raises his cider glass. Badger reluctantly sits back
          down.

                         FOX
          I guess we do have those three ugly,
          cusshole farmers to thank for one thing:
          reminding us to be thankful and aware of
          each other. I'm going to say it again.

                         (GESTURING EXPANSIVELY)
          Aware.
          Badger whispers to his wife:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         BADGER
          Foxy cuss-blocked my toast, man.

                         CUT TO:
          The hole where Fox's tree once stood. The dead tree lies on
          its side. A fireman slides a thick hose deep into the tunnel.
          He looks behind him and nods.

                         FIREMAN #1
          Ready.
          The shot moves backwards along the hose, past seven more
          firemen signalling to each other with: a thumbs-up, a snap, a
          fist in the air, a swirl of the fingers, a peace symbol, an A-
          OK, and a hook-'em Horns. The shot continues past Boggis,
          Bunce, and Bean helping to hold the hose in position. Boggis
          growls. Bunce hisses. Bean snarls. The shot arrives at a pump
          on the side of the fire truck. The chief points:

                         CHIEF
          Let her rip.
          A fireman cranks a huge wrench on a steel nut. A pressure
          gauge shoots to maximum. The fire truck and hose begin to
          vibrate loudly.

                         CUT TO:
          Ash and Kristofferson crouched under a drain-cover pushed
          just-open next to a refrigerator. They peer out across a
          bright, clean, white kitchen at a plate of perfect, golden
          cookies on a counter-top next to an open window with a step-
          ladder directly in front of it. They look at each other. They
          look around the quiet, empty room. Ash shrugs.
          Ash and Kristofferson dart out, leaving the drain-cover
          propped-up. They race over the linoleum. They climb the step-
          ladder and stop at the plate. Ash swoons and says

                         RAPTUROUSLY:

                         ASH
          They're still warm.
          Ash and Kristofferson gather more cookies than they can
          possibly carry, eating as they collect them. Crumbs go
          everywhere.
          On the other side of the room, the drain-cover falls shut
          with a loud clank. Ash and Kristofferson look up, wildly
          startled. All at once they hear in a simultaneous cacophony:
          the back door bursting open, a boy and two beagles shouting
          and barking, the pantry door slamming, Mrs. Bean and her

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          middle-aged housekeeper clanging pots and pans and arguing, a
          timer on the counter-top ringing, and a raven fluttering to
          the windowsill and cawing.
          Ash and Kristofferson panic silently. They drop the cookies
          and fly down the step-ladder.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox in mid-toast:

                         FOX
          I've stepped on some toes and alienated a
          few of you over the past few days -- but
          is it wrong for me to suggest we might've
          done worse than having an incredible
          banquet in a beautiful flint-mine
          surrounded by our favorite animals? Look
          at each other. Here we are. Wow. Now I've
          already had too much to drink, and I'm
          feeling sentimental, but I'm going to say
          something, anyway, which nobody wants to
          admit, but I think is probably true: we
          beat 'em. We beat those farmers, and now
          we're triumphantly eating their roasted
          chicken, their sizzling duck, their
          succulent turkey, their foie gras de --

                         (SUDDENLY)
          Where'd the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson?
          (to Mrs. Fox)
          What am I hearing again, baby? What's
          happening? Am I still paranoid?
          There is a low, distant rumbling which rapidly builds to a
          deafening roar. Everyone waits, frozen. A single drop of
          water drips from the ceiling into Badger's water glass. Fox
          turns to Badger and says:

                         FOX
          Let's pause again.
          A wild deluge smashes into the room flooding the flint-mine
          and tunnels with a blasting current that sweeps everyone and
          everything away chaotically.

                         CUT TO:
          The entire party of well-dressed animals and their plates,
          furniture, chickens, etc. shooting down the tunnel with the
          rushing waters. Fox, helpless, holding his breath, looks to
          the others underwater: Badger shakes his head in disgust;
          Rabbit makes a fierce grimace; Mole bares his teeth
          ferociously; Beaver rants angrily with bubbles coming out off
          his mouth; and Kylie stares ahead vacantly, holding his nose.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          Fox turns sadly to Mrs. Fox. She looks terrified.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT

          The flood blasts out of a wide pipe rocketing the animals
          into a murky, brick cavern with drainpipes on all sides and
          three inches of black water on its floor. Fox picks himself
          up, dazed and scared, and looks around at his soaked friends
          and their families.

                         FOX
          What the cuss just happened? Something
          with water. That was dangerous. Is anyone
          hurt?

                         BADGER

                         (FURIOUS )
          We're all hurt! My entire flint-mine just
          got demolished!

                         FOX
          Let's do a head-count! Everybody pick a
          buddy!
          Each animal turns to his neighbor and establishes their buddy
          relationship. Fox looks wildly agitated as his eyes dart
          about, searching. He shouts:

                         FOX
          Where'd the boys go? Ash? Kristofferson?
          Ash's voice cracks on the other side of the cavern:

                         ASH
          I'm here.
          Everyone turns to see Ash standing at the mouth of a smaller
          pipe. He looks devastated and terrified. Fox points to him.

                         FOX
          Ash! Who's your buddy?

                         ASH
          Kristofferson, but I lost him.

                         FOX
          You lost him? Where were you?

                         ASH
          We went for cookies.
          Everyone turns to Fox. Fox yells desperately:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         FOX
          Kristofferson!
          Fox sprints around the cavern, splashing, digging, and
          ducking in and out of tunnels as the others join his frantic
          search. His voice sounds pained as he shouts:

                         FOX
          Kristofferson! Kristofferson!
          Kristofferson!

                         CUT TO:
          The three farmers standing next to the fire truck. Bean holds
          a soaked, half-conscious Kristofferson up in the air by the
          tail. Kristofferson is quietly crying.

                         BEAN
          Wrap this wet, little mutt in a newspaper
          and put him in a box with some holes
          punched in the top.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT

          Everyone has gathered together. They are all in a state of
          shock. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox beside him.

                         FOX
          Your brother's going to kill me, if he
          survives his double-pneumonia.
          Beaver runs into the brick cavern out of a drainpipe,

                         SHOUTING:

                         BEAVER
          There's only one way out of this sewer,
          but the manhole cover's closed, and
          there's a station-wagon parked on it --
          which means we're permanently stuck down
          here.

                         BADGER

                         (BITTERLY)
          You still think we beat 'em, Foxy?
          Everyone turns to Fox and stares at him coldly. Fox sits down
          on the floor, in the water. He says quietly:

                         FOX
          Somebody take over. I'm not in charge
          anymore.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.
          Everyone looks around at each other. They don't know what to
          do. Mrs. Fox sits down in the water next to Fox.

                         FOX
          You told me to change, but I can't --

                         (REALIZING)
          -- except, possibly, on some level, I
          think I just did.

          MRS. FOX

                         (PAUSE)
          Well, then maybe we're not all going to
          die.
          Fox looks to Mrs. Fox. He stands up suddenly. He takes Mrs.
          Fox's hand.

                         FOX
          Excuse us, everyone.
          Fox leads Mrs. Fox over to a ledge near a cement waterfall on
          the far side of the brick cavern. He puts his arm around her
          waist.

                         FOX
          Badger's right. These farmers aren't
          going to quit until they catch me. I
          shouldn't have lied to your face. I
          shouldn't have resigned slash gotten
          fired from the Gazette. I shouldn't have
          pushed these farmers so far and tried to
          embarrass them and cuss with their heads.
          I enjoyed it, but I shouldn't have done
          it -- and now there's only one way out.
          Maybe if I hand myself over and let them
          kill me, stuff me, and hang me over their

                         MANTELPIECE --

          MRS. FOX

                         (ICILY)
          You'll do no such thing.

                         FOX

                         (QUIETLY)
          Darling, maybe they'll let everyone else
          live.
          Mrs. Fox stares at Fox. She says desolately:

          MRS. FOX
          Why'd you have to get us into this, Foxy?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         FOX
          I don't know, but I have a possible
          theory. I think I have this thing where I
          need everybody to think I'm the greatest
          -- the quote-unquote fantastic Mr. Fox --
          and if they aren't completely knocked-
          out, dazzled, and kind of intimidated by
          me, then I don't feel good about myself.
          Mrs. Fox shakes her head and turns away. Fox continues:

                         FOX
          Foxes traditionally like to court danger,
          hunt prey, and outsmart predators -- and
          that's what I'm actually good at! I
          think, at the end of the day, I'm just --

          MRS. FOX

                         (QUIETLY)
          We're wild animals.
          Fox smiles sadly and nods. He shrugs.

                         FOX
          I guess we always were. I promise you: if
          I had all this to do over again, I'd have
          never let you down. It was always more
          fun when we did it together, anyway.
          Mrs. Fox has tears all over her face. Fox kisses her. He
          whispers in her ear:

                         FOX
          I love you, Felicity.

          MRS. FOX
          I love you, too, but I shouldn't have
          married you.
          Mrs. Fox turns and walks away. Fox stares after her. He goes
          over to Ash.

                         FOX
          Did I ever tell you about the time I
          learned we were going to have a cub?

                         ASH
          In the fox-trap.

                         FOX
          Right. We were at gun-point, and your

                         MOTHER --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         ASH
          -- says she's pregnant.

                         FOX
          Let me tell it, OK? I had no idea how we
          were going to get out of this jam, and
          then it hit me: what do foxes do better
          than any other animal?

                         ASH
          Dig.

                         FOX
          You're stepping on my lines.

                         ASH
          Keep telling it.

                         FOX
          So we dug. And the whole time I put paw
          over paw, scooping dirt and pebbles with
          your mother digging like crazy beside me,
          I kept wondering: who is this little boy
          going to be?

                         ASH
          Or girl.

                         FOX
           Or girl, right -- because at that point
           we didn't know.
          Fox grabs Ash by his shoulders and looks him in the eye.

                          FOX
           Ash, I'm so glad he was you.
          Fox hugs Ash tightly, holds him for an instant, then let's
          go. He turns to the group.

                         FOX
          Badger, organize a search party and try
          to find Kristofferson. Maybe he's alive.
          I'm sorry, everyone. I wish --

                         (HESITATES)
          Well, good-bye.
          Fox looks across the cavern to Mrs. Fox standing with her
          back to him. She turns to face him. Her eyes are burning. Fox
          smiles sadly. He races away down the drain-pipe. Everyone
          watches him disappear. Badger hesitates. He addresses the

                         GROUP UNCERTAINLY:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         BADGER
          I guess we should probably split into a
          certain number of groups and start doing
          something, right?

          INT. CONDUIT. NIGHT

          Fox sprints full-speed in the darkness. His claws scratch
          rattling along the iron floor and splash through puddles of
          shallow water.
          Fox stops suddenly. He stands up tall on his hind legs. His
          ears perk up. One pins back. He listens.

                         CUT TO:
          Badger carrying a lantern leading Ash, Mole, and two small
          rabbits down a drainpipe. Badger calls out:

                         BADGER
          Kristofferson? Hello? Can you hear us?
          Rat's voice echoes in the darkness:

                         RAT
          Y'all lookin' for somethin'? Nothin' down
          here but rusty bottle-caps and drainin'
          water.
          Everyone stops short. Rat drops into the pipe from an
          overhead drain ahead of them. He says ominously:

                         RAT
          They got the boy.

                         BADGER

                         (FROZEN)
          Who's got him?

                         RAT
          The farmers three. You know who I'm
          talkin' about.

                         BADGER

                         (HESITATES)
          They've kidnapped him?

                         RAT
          Well-done, Mr. Badger. You're a smart
          man. They want to trade the son for his
          poppa.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          Rat flicks a folded letter through the air. Badger catches
          it. He opens it. Kylie looks over his shoulder. Badger
          frowns.

                         BADGER
          Why'd they write this in letters cut out
          of magazines?

                         KYLIE
          To protect their identities.
          (on second thought)
          Oh, right, but then why'd they sign their
          names? Plus, we already knew who they
          were because they're trying to kill us.

                         INSERT:
          A ransom note written in letters cut out of magazines and
          pasted onto a piece of paper. Badger reads out loud:
          Mr. Fox, we have your son. If you
          ever want to see him alive again --
          Ash calls out:

                         ASH
          I'm his son.
          Everyone looks at Ash. He stands behind them in silhouette.
          Rat says darkly:

                         RAT
          I can see the resemblance.
          Pause. In an instant, Rat grabs Ash by the tail, picks him up
          off the ground, swings him in the air, and flings him away
          twenty feet down the drainpipe. Badger looks stunned.
          Ash sits in a puddle in a stupor. Rat races toward him down
          the tunnel. He leaps into the air with his claws out and his
          teeth bared. As he is about to seize upon Ash -- he is
          suddenly jerked backwards and spun around.
          Rat is face to face with Fox. Fox strikes his old-fashioned
          boxing stance. He draws back and throws a hard punch, nailing
          Rat square in the jaw. Rat staggers, stunned. He swings his
          switchblade, cutting Fox across the chest.
          Fox touches the wound and looks at the blood on the fingers
          of his paw. He looks to Rat. Rat holds up his wrist and shows
          Fox a child's plastic digital watch with miniature footballs,
          baseballs, and soccer balls on it. He says strangely:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         RAT
          I've still got it.

                         FOX

                         (FROWNING)
          What'd you just say?

                         RAT
          I said I've still got the watch, Mr. Fox.
          She never asked for it back.
          A frozen moment. Fox springs forward and clamps his jaws onto
          Rat's throat. Rat tumbles over backwards. Fox pins him to the
          ground with his teeth in Rat's neck. Rat kicks and bucks and
          struggles, but Fox holds him fast. Rat goes limp. Fox
          releases him.
          Everyone slowly gathers around Fox and Rat. Ash kneels next
          to his father. Fox cradles Rat in his arms. Rat whispers:

                         RAT
          The boy's locked in an apple crate on top
          of a gun-locker in the attic of Bean
          Annex. It's a set-up.

                         FOX

                         (SADLY)
          Would you have told me if I didn't kill
          you first?
          Rat smiles sickly. Blood drips from his mouth. His voice

                         CREAKS:

                         RAT
          Never.

                         FOX
          (shaking his head)
          All these wasted years. What were you
          looking for, Rat?
          Fox wipes the blood from Rat's chin. Rat mutters.

                         ASH
          He's trying to say something, Dad.
          Fox leans his ear close to Rat's mouth. As quiet as a mouse,

                         RAT WHISPERS:

                         RAT
          Cider.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.
          Fox nods. He looks around the drainpipe. He cups his paw into
          the pool of murky water and holds it to Rat's lips.

                         FOX
          Here you are, Rat. A beaker of Bean's
          finest secret cider.
          Rat's slivery, scratchity, long, pink tongue laps up a taste
          of the black liquid. He licks his lips and says faintly:

                         RAT
          Like melted gold.
          Rat's eyes turn into X's. He is dead. Ash stands up.

                         ASH
          He redeemed himself.

                         FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          Redemption? Sure.
          Fox swallows and says hopelessly with tears in his eyes:

                         FOX
          But, in the end -- he's just another dead
          rat in a garbage pail behind a Chinese
          restaurant.
          Ash puts his hand on Fox's shoulder. Fox lays Rat gently onto
          the sewer floor. He stands up and turns to the rest of the
          group. Badger claps his paws together.

                         BADGER
          Well, I suppose we should --

          Excuse me, again, B. The search party's
          been cancelled. We're replacing it with a
          go-for-broke rescue mission. It's a set-
          up, but maybe we can make it work. You
          two little rabbits run tell the others.

                         (YELLING)
          Now, go!
          The two little rabbits scurry away down the drainpipe. Badger
          walks with Fox and Ash.

                         BADGER
          What was he saying about that wristwatch?
          I didn't get what he was talking about.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          Fox hesitates. He shrugs and says with a sad nostalgia:

                         FOX
          Just some old back-story.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT

          The entire community of animals has reconnoitered in the
          brick cavern. Fox stands on a large spigot and addresses the
          group. He has a bandage on his chest.

                         FOX
          In a way, I'm almost glad that flood
          interrupted us, because I don't like the
          toast I was giving. I'm going to start
          over.
          Fox pantomimes raising a long-stemmed glass.

                         FOX
          When I look down this table with the
          exquisite feast set before us, I see: two
          terrific lawyers, a skilled pediatrician,
          a wonderful chef, a savvy real-estate
          agent, an excellent tailor, a crack
          accountant, a gifted musician, a pretty
          good minnow fisherman, and possibly the
          best landscape painter working on the
          scene today.
          As Fox describes them, the shot cuts to: Badger and Beaver;
          Mrs. Badger; Rabbit; Weasel; an especially small, waifish
          field mouse; Mole; Kylie (who looks slightly offended); and
          Mrs. Fox, respectively.

          Maybe a few of you might even read my

          tend to doubt it.

                         (DRAMATIC PAUSE)
          I also see a room full of wild animals.
          Everyone stares at Fox curiously, skeptical but intrigued.
          Fox points at them:

                         FOX
          Wild animals with true natures and pure
          talents. Wild animals with scientific-

          Anyway, I think it may very well be all
          the beautiful differences among us that
          just might give us the tiniest glimmer of
          a chance of saving my nephew and letting
          me make it up to you for getting us into
          this crazy whatever-it-is. I don't know.
          It's just a thought. Thank you for
          listening. Cheers, everyone.
          Fox motions with his imaginary glass and pantomimes drinking
          it. A few of the others reluctantly pantomime drinking. Fox
          finishes his glass and pantomimes throwing it on the floor.
          He makes a smashing-glass sound. Kylie shouts:

                         KYLIE
          Let's eat!
          Everyone turns to Kylie uncertainly. Kylie hesitates.

                         KYLIE

          Pause. Badger points to his otter secretary. She is Linda.

          The field mouse shoves his way to the front of the crowd. He
          makes a fist with his paw.

          Kylie tugs at Fox's sleeve. Fox turns to look at him. Kylie

                         SAYS SHYLY:

                         KYLIE
          I didn't get a job yet -- or a Latin
          name. What's my strength?
          Fox raises an eyebrow. He thinks of something:

          Listen, you're Kylie. You're an
          unbelievably nice guy. Your job is really
          just to... be available, I think. I don't
          know your Latin name. I doubt they even
          had opossums in ancient Rome.
          Kylie puts his hands in his pockets and scowls.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. NIGHT

          Mrs. Fox puts the finishing touches on a vast mural painted
          on the longest, tallest wall of the brick cavern. She stands
          on a ladder. Her sleeves are rolled up, and she is splattered
          with twelve different colors of paint. She looks down to Fox
          standing below with an entourage of Kylie, Badger, Linda, and
          Rickity. The animal children mop and scrub in the background.
          Ash stands leaning against a push-broom watching his parents.
          Fox surveys the mural. It is highly detailed, filled with the
          textures of the landscape, and decorated with images of
          flowers, leaves, acorns, etc. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox
          opens his arms wide and shouts:

                         FOX
          It's stupendous. Where's us?

          MRS. FOX

          The bottom of the map. Mrs. Fox's paw paints a red X and puts
          a circle around it.
          The shot zooms out to reveal the entire valley -- no longer a
          painting on the brick wall. Lighting strikes at the horizon.
          Dark clouds loom over the three farmers' compounds. It looks
          exactly like one of Mrs. Fox's paintings of a landscape in a
          rainstorm. Bean's helicopter circles the area.

          EXT. HILL. NIGHT

          A bicycle messenger with a head-lamp rings his bell as he
          approaches the farmers' camp. He stops in front of Bean and
          hands him an envelope. Bean tears it open and unfolds the
          letter inside.

                         INSERT:

          A note written in letters cut out of magazines and pasted
          onto a piece of paper. It reads:
          Dear Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean,
          I have no alternative but to agree to
          your terms. Move the station wagon and
          open the manhole cover below the foot of
          the drainpipe next to the cobbler's shop
          and meet me there today at 10 A.M. sharp.
          I will hand myself over to you in
          exchange for the boy's safe return.
          Cordially,
          Mr. Fox
          Bean frowns. He studies the letter. He shows it to Boggis and
          Bunce.

                         BEAN
          Why'd he write this in letters cut out of
          magazines?

          The top floor of Bean Annex. The room is filled with boxes of
          Christmas ornaments, old sports equipment, two stained
          mattresses, and a broken birdcage. Cobwebs hang from the
          rafters below the sloped roof.
          Kristofferson stands with his hands in his pockets looking
          out between the slats from inside a padlocked apple crate on
          top of a gun locker in the corner. He clears his throat. He
          calls out politely:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Could I have a cup of water, please?
          Kristofferson waits for a reply, but no one answers. He
          whistles to himself for a minute. He clears his throat again.
          He calls out:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Excuse me! Excuse me?

          INT. DRAINPIPE. DAY

          A cement conduit with an iron grating above it. A fast stream
          of sewer water runs along its side. Fox walks briskly down
          the pipe followed by his entourage and Ash. Their steps echo
          loudly.

          Django's where Rat played horn down
          near -- can I tell this another time? We

          Ash comes up to Fox's side and says discreetly:

          I should probably ride with you and Kylie

          I didn't understand a word of that

          EXT. STREET. DAY

          An old craftsman looks out from the window of Ferguson
          Cobblers as he taps little nails into the heel of a loafer. A
          station-wagon with wood-grain side-panels and a flat tire
          sits parked on a manhole cover in front of the shop. Boggis,
          Bunce, and five armed farmhands watch as Bean monkeys with a
          slim-jim until he gets the car door jimmied.
          Bean hops inside. He starts the engine, puts his arm over the
          top of the seat as he looks back out the rear window, and
          throws the station-wagon into reverse. The farmers clear out
          of the way as Bean backs up off the manhole cover.
          Boggis and Bunce stick tools into the manhole cover and lift
          it open.

                         INSERT:
          Rat's watch. It is now 10 A.M.

                         CUT TO:
          Six armed farmhands on the roof of the Nag's Head Tavern.

                         CUT TO:
          Seven armed farmhands in the bushes behind Sweetings Bakery.

                         CUT TO:
          Eight armed farmers in the window of Harrison Travel.

                         CUT TO:
          The Action 13 reporter and camera crew in an alley next to
           St. John's Coin-op Laundry.

          EXT. STREET. DAY

          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean crouch behind the open doors of a
          pick-up truck with three beagles. Boggis checks his carbine.
          Bunce loads his shotgun. Bean cocks his Luger. Fox's voice
          hollers from deep inside the manhole:

          FOX (O.S.)
          Did you bring the boy?

                         BEAN
          Of course, we did! Say something, kid!
          Bunce presses play on a tape recorder. Kristofferson's voice
          comes over a loudspeaker:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         KRISTOFFERSON'S VOICE
          Excuse me! Excuse me?
          Bunce presses stop.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and his entourage at the bottom off the manhole. Fox
          scoffs. He smiles and shakes his head.

                         FOX
          Come on! That doesn't sound anything like
          him! It's amateur night in Dixie!
          Badger rapidly slaps two pieces of flint together. A bit
          chips off, and sparks fly from the break. He blows on some
          kindling. He takes a pinecone out of a basket.

          EXT. STREET. DAY

          A ribbon of white smoke rises out of the manhole. The three
          farmers watch curiously as it thickens and turns black. Bean
          frowns.

                         BEAN
          What the cuss is he burning?
          A blazing pinecone shoots out of the manhole and flies
          through the air, over the farmers' heads. It lands in a trash
          can and lights some rubbish on fire. A man with a dart in one
          hand and a mug of ale in the other comes out of the Nag's
          Head and pours his beer into the trash can. The fire goes
          out.
          The three farmers laugh smugly. Bean shouts:

                         BEAN
          Is that all you've got, Mr. Fox?
          Twenty-seven blazing pinecones shoot out of the manhole and
          hit: a wood-pile on the roof of the Nag's Head, a box of
          pastry wrappers in the bushes behind Sweetings, a stack of
          brochures in the window of Harrison Travel, a hay bale in the
          bed of the pick-up truck, Boggis, Bunce, Bean, and a crate of
          cam-corder batteries next to the Action 13 camera crew, which
          explodes. Farmers scatter, grabbing hoses, yelling, and
          tamping out the flames as the beagles bark, yelp, and
          scramble in the confusion.
          Rabbit darts out of the hole and races up the street. Six
          farmers chase after him, firing their weapons.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. DAY

          Down in the brick cavern, Mole listens to a tin can attached
          to a string. He says urgently as he makes notations in a

                         LEDGER:

                         MOLE
          Twenty-eight pinecones fired! Twenty-two
          targets hit!
          Mrs. Fox, standing on her ladder, paints black checks quickly
          on the street in her mural. The stolen, portable television
          set sits in the corner, tuned into Action 13's coverage of
          the chaos in the street.

                         CUT TO:
          Rabbit running full-steam out of the village being pursued by
          the six farmhands. He hurdles an empty Coke bottle lying on
          its side in the road.

          EXT. STREET. DAY

          Badger jumps out of the manhole and throws more blazing
          pinecones at farmers, trucks, parked cars, doors, windows,
          and the Action 13 camera crew. Seven farmhands chase him down
          a cobblestone lane.
          Weasel and Beaver climb out with straws in their paws and
          start firing blueberries toward the disoriented beagles. The
          beagles eat blueberries. They fall over. Eight farmhands
          chase Weasel and Beaver up a wooded path.
          Rickity, the field mouse, bounds out of the hole and leaps
          into the fracas. He fires a rubber band at Bunce off a
          paperclip. It snaps Bunce in the corner of his eye. Rickity
          lets out a little whoop.
          There is a small explosion and a burst of flames blasts from
          the manhole. Fox and Kylie jump out and run over to a vehicle
          with a tarp over it parked in front of Paddington Automotive.
          Fox whips off the tarp, revealing a miniature motorcycle with
          a sidecar.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox driving the motorcycle with Kylie in the sidecar. They
          both wear helmets and goggles. Thunder rumbles in the
          distance. Kylie sinks lower in the sidecar. He shouts to Fox
          over the sound of the motor:

                         KYLIE
          Are you scared of wolves?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         FOX
          Scared, no! I have a phobia of them!

                         KYLIE
          Well, I have a thing about thunder!

                         FOX

                         (ANNOYED)
          Why? That's stupid!
          Ash pokes his head up from the rear compartment of the
          sidecar. He also wears a helmet and goggles. His white cape
          flutters behind him. He shouts:

                         ASH
          I don't like needles!
          Fox and Kylie look to Ash in disbelief. Fox says furiously:

                         FOX
          Where'd you come from again? How'd you
          get in the sidecar? I feel like I'm
          losing my mind!
          Fox angrily steers toward a small mound of dirt. They jump it
          slightly and fly over a little ditch. Ash yelps
          enthusiastically as Fox drives them back onto the road.

          INT. HELICOPTER. DAY

          A pilot with a red moustache and a South African accent flies
          Bean's chopper. He wears a Bean, inc. patch on his shoulder.
          He shouts into the microphone connected to his helmet:

                         PILOT
          I've got a fox on a motorcycle with a
          littler fox and what looks to be an
          opossum in the sidecar riding north on
          farm lane seven. Does that sound like
          anything to anybody?
          A military-type voice responds over the radio:

          MILITARY VOICE (O.S.)
          Roger that, Red. Let me just, uh -- Oh, I
          think the boss wants to --

          BEAN (0.S.)
          Red, it's Franklin Bean! Turn around, get
          the cuss back here, and pick us up on the

          A.S.A.P!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

          EXT. BEAN'S COMPOUND. DAY

          The Bean, inc. windmill spins briskly in the dusty winds.
          Shutters on the farmhouse bang open and shut. Leaves rustle
          on the branches of the apple trees. A few stray turkeys
          wander in the yard. A white-washed brick pile six stories
          tall sits apart from the other structures. The doors to its
          courtyard are made of iron and painted yellow. This is Bean
          Annex.
          The front gates of the farm are open, and a gardener waters
          vegetables next to the driveway. Fox, Kylie, and Ash look out
          from a high branch over a reinforced concrete and barbed-wire
          security barricade.

                         FOX
          That's the annex over there on the right.
          Ash nods. Kylie does not respond.

                         FOX
          The white building over there on the
          right.
          Pause. Fox looks to Kylie.

                         FOX
          Kylie?
          Kylie turns to Fox and stares at him vacantly. Fox says

                         SHARPLY:

                         FOX
          Kylie!

                         KYLIE
          What?

                         (SUDDENLY)
          I did it!

                         FOX
          When? I didn't see it!
          Kylie makes his slight gesture with his paw. The gardener
          puts three turnips into a basket and rides away on his
          bicycle.
          Fox, Kylie, and Ash scramble down the tree trunk. They come
          out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the
          gates, across the yard, past the wandering turkeys. They park
          outside the courtyard doors to Bean Annex and jump off the
          motorcycle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          Fox climbs onto Kylie's shoulders and tries the knobs. They
          are locked.

                         FOX
          Kylie, you got a credit card?

                         KYLIE
          (digging in his pockets)
          Sure.

                         FOX

                         (IMPRESSED)
          See, this is what I was saying about how
          good you are at just being available for

                         WHATEVER --
          Kylie hands Fox a World Traveler Titanium Card. Fox frowns.

                         FOX
          A Titanium Card? How the cuss did you
          qualify for this?

                         KYLIE

                         (SHRUGS)
          I pay my bills on time. I've always had
          good credit.
          Fox examines the card with mild resentment. He picks the lock
          and opens the doors.
          The courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor. On one side,
          there are ten trash cans, a stack of newspapers, and a
          compost heap. On the other side, there is an old, rusted,
          broken-down tractor and a new one. By far the largest,
          fattest, toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in the middle.
          White foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily.
          Its collar is hooked to a thick chain. A tag around its neck
          reads Spitz.
          Fox, Kylie, and Ash stop in their tracks. The beagle opens
          his eyes. Fox turns to Kylie.

                         FOX
          Give me a blueberry.
          Kylie looks surprised. He shrugs. He shakes his head and
          gestures, I don't have any. Fox frowns. He throws up his
          hands in the air. Kylie makes a frustrated face. Fox points
          at him. Kylie looks away and snorts angrily. Fox looks away
          and spits at the ground. Ash says quietly:

                         ASH
          What's that white stuff around his mouth?

                         (SQUINTING)
          I think he eats soap.
          Fox sees an amber, plastic pharmacy bottle on a shelf above
          some bags of fertilizer. It's reads:
          Drug: Phenomoxylcarbobubytol, 10 mg

                         NAME: SPITZ

          For: RABIES (chronic)
          Other: Take with meat, do not operate heavy machinery
          Fox frowns. He says grimly:

                         FOX
          That's not soap.

                         KYLIE

                         (HESITATES)
          Well, then why does he have that bubbly --

                         FOX
          He's rabid. With rabies. I've heard about
          this beagle.
          The beagle stands up. Fox says carefully:

                         FOX
          Easy, boy.
          Fox takes a cautious step toward the beagle. He holds out the
          back of his paw for the beagle to sniff. He says back over
          his shoulder to Kylie and Ash:

                         FOX
          I'm going to try to befriend him. I feel
          like there's a tenderness in his eyes.
          Fox takes another step. He makes a soft, kissing noise. The
          beagle watches him calmly.

                         FOX
           Yes, I'm right. He's a good boy. A little
          lonely, maybe, but --
          Fox takes another cautious step.

                         FOX
          -- but terribly sweet. Hello, there, boy.
          Is your name Spitz? That's German, isn't
          it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         KYLIE
          (aside, to Ash)
          I thought he said you never look a beagle
          in the eye.

                         FOX

                         (COAXINGLY)
          Why, you're just as sweet as a --
          Fox and the beagle lock eyes. The pupils of the beagle's eyes
          contract then completely disappear, and the whites turn
          bright red. Fox's eyes open wider than their sockets.
          The rabid beagle erupts ballistically, attacking like an
          enraged maniac. His chain rips out of the cement. Fox, Kylie,
          and Ash shriek and scream, sprinting frantically around the
          courtyard as the rabid beagle, frothing, roaring, and
          snapping, tries desperately to kill them. Fox shouts, his
          voice cracking like a grandmother's:

                         FOX
          Climb the trellis!
          In well under a second, Fox, Kylie, and Ash scale the trellis
          six stories -- Kylie's pants catching on a nail and ripping
          off on the way up -- and find themselves standing on the roof
          of Bean Annex. Kylie wears blue Fruit-of-the-Looms with a
          pattern of stars, moons, and planets on them. They all look
          down at the rabid beagle, which continues to pitch an insane
          fit, running in circles after its tail at the bottom of the
          courtyard.
          Fox takes in their new surroundings. He says, pleased:

                         FOX
          So the attic is probably in the area
          right up around here somewhere, I figure,
          huh?
          Kylie and Ash, panting and dripping with sweat, both stare at
          Fox vacantly.
          (NOTE: a second set of alternate eyeballs indicating Kylie's
          vacant look will be used for Ash in this shot.)

                         (IRRITATED)
          Come on, guys. Stay with me. We did good.
          That's just some dog. Let's not get
          traumatized.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

          EXT. ROOF. DAY

          Bean's helicopter lands on top of the Nag's Head. Fires
          smolder and farmers continue to chase around after animals in
          the village streets below. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, leaning
          over and holding onto their hats, run to the chopper and
          climb inside. They take off.

                         CUT TO:
          The street below. An orange and yellow Citroen van screeches
          into the melee. Painted yellow letters spell Badoit et Fils,
          Destruction des Animaux Nuisibles on the side of it with an
          image of a trapped fox.
          An old man with a grey moustache and a young man with a black
          moustache, both dressed in orange-and-yellow-striped
          uniforms, jump out of the van. They open the side door and
          start unloading stacks of metal cages.

                         CUT TO:
          Rabbit still running full-steam down a country lane being
          pursued by the six farmhands.

          INT. ATTIC. DAY

          Kristofferson stands inside the apple crate leaning against
          the wall with his legs crossed and one arm akimbo with his
          hand on his hip. There is a clanking sound from above.
          Kristofferson looks up.
          A trap door in the ceiling creaks open. Fox, Kylie, and Ash
          look inside, down at Kristofferson. Kristofferson smiles
          oddly and says in a surprised, fancy-meeting-you-here voice:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Hi!

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Kylie lowering Ash into the room with three different-
          colored shoelaces tied together and belted around his waist.
          Ash holds the shoelace and keeps a paw behind his back like a
          mountaineer. His feet touch down on the shelf. He runs to the
          apple crate and jiggles the padlock. He hesitates. He says

                         SUDDENLY:

                         ASH
          Can I get one of those karate lessons
          real quick?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         KRISTOFFERSON

                         (LONG PAUSE)
          OK. Normally, we start with some
          breathing exercises and such. Stand like
          this.
          Kristofferson stands with his paws clasped in front of him.
          Ash mimics this.

                         CUT TO:
          A fox-trap hanging from a chain suspended above the alley
          behind the Nag's Head Tavern. A second one hangs behind
          Sweetings Bakery. A third one hangs behind Harrison Travel. A
          fourth one hangs behind St. John's Coin-op Laundry. A fifth
          one hangs behind Ferguson Cobblers.
          Rickity curiously examines a little, hanging wire. He mutters

                         TO HIMSELF:

                         RICKITY
          Is this spring-loaded?

                         CUT TO:
          Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          This next part is mental. Position
          yourself on the balls of your feet.
          Kristofferson stands lightly poised with his arms out. Ash
          mimics this.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Close your eyes.
          Kristofferson closes his eyes. So does Ash. So do Fox and
          Kylie. Kristofferson says mystically:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          You weigh less than a slice of bread.

                         CUT TO:
          Each fox-trap in rapid succession as it falls on: Rickity,
          Badger, Weasel, and Beaver. The two small rabbits watch from
          a sewer-gutter drain under the street-curb. They panic. They
          race down a pipe, into a tunnel, and through a conduit.

                         CUT TO:
          Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Let's review the principle agility
          techniques: jumping, flipping, landing.

                         CUT TO:
          Mrs. Fox looking down from her ladder at the three, panting
          rabbits. She looks stunned. She motions to her mural/map and

                         SAYS:

          MRS. FOX
          Show me where they are!

                         CUT TO:
          The two small rabbits, Mrs. Rabbit, Mrs. Badger, Mole, and
          Mrs. Fox each furiously digging a new tunnel.

          KRISTOFFERSON (V.0.)
          Now for a rudimentary version of the
          cyclone chop.

                         CUT TO:
          Kristofferson continuing Ash's karate lesson:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          First, you need to get a running start,
          which, obviously, I can't do in here,
          then, as you arrive at the destination of
          the chop --

                         (DEMONSTRATING)
          -- lean and thrust into the point of
          contact, paw remains open and straight,
          then withdraw instantaneously. Remember,
          it's the pull-back that matters. The pull-

                         BACK --

                         (DEMONSTRATING)
          -- generates the force of the impact.

                         ASH

                         (IMMEDIATELY)
          Got it.
          Ash walks ten paces away to the far end of the shelf. Fox and
          Kylie watch from above. Kylie says excitedly:

                         KYLIE
          He's going to do it!
          Fox makes a face that says, I'm not so sure. Ash takes a deep
          breath. He screams at the top of his lungs as he sprints
          toward the apple crate:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         ASH
          Ki-ya!
          Ash's toe catches on a loose nail. He somersaults twice
          through the air and bounces off the side of the apple crate,
          which falls off the shelf.
          Kristofferson braces himself. The apple crate hits the floor
          and shatters into pieces. Kristofferson lies among the
          wreckage.
          Ash looks over the side of the shelf. Fox and Kylie watch
          from above, grimacing.

                         ASH
          I'm sorry.

                         KRISTOFFERSON

                         (DAZED)
          That's all right. You were just trying to
          unlock the apple crate.

                         ASH
          No, I mean I'm sorry about --

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          (picking himself up)
          Oh, you mean from before. The apology you
          owed me which you never actually said.

                         ASH
          Yeah.
          Kristofferson nods sadly. He takes a deep breath. He nods
          again.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          That's all right, too. Throw me the
          shoelace, please.
          Ash smiles.

                         CUT TO:
          Badger trapped in his cage. He hears something. He looks
          quickly down the alley. The old, orange van turns the corner
          and approaches, bumping over potholes. Badger shrinks into
          the corner of the cage and mutters grimly to himself:

                         BADGER
          Badoit et fils.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          A cobblestone beside Badger suddenly drops straight down and
          disappears into the ground. Badger recoils, scared and
          confused.
          Mrs. Fox pokes her head up through the hole. She is beaded
          with perspiration and breathes heavily. Her fur is wildly
          dishevelled. She looks to the van driving up the alley. She
          looks to Badger. She extends her paw to him and says

                         FIERCELY:

          MRS. FOX
          Let's go!

          EXT. YARD. DAY

          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson come around the side of
          the building. They run to their motorcycle, outside the
          courtyard doors. They freeze.
          The front gates to the compound are closed and bolted. Bean's
          helicopter waits on top of the vegetable garden with its
          rotar-blades whirling. Boggis, Bunce, and Bean stand in front
          of Bean Annex with their weapons drawn.
          Fox sees his tail around Bean's collar. His eyes narrow. His
          jaw sets. He says to himself with growing emotion:

                         FOX
          Your tractors uprooted my tree. Your
          posse hunted my family. Your gunmen
          kidnapped my nephew. Your rat insulted my
          wife -- and you shot off my tail.

                         (STEELY)
          I'm not leaving here without that neck-
          tie.
          Bean smiles his sickly smile. Fox smiles back defiantly.
          Kylie looks utterly baffled. Ash says mystically:

                         ASH
          I weigh less than a slice of bread.

                         FOX

                         (HESITATES)
          What?

                         ASH
          I'll be right back.
          Ash runs. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson watch, shocked, as
          Ash sprints back to the courtyard doors. The three farmers
          open fire at him. Fox, Kylie, and Kristofferson duck and take
          cover behind a hay-bale.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          Ash dodges bullets. He jumps off the balls of his feet with
          his arms out over a sprinkler-pipe and swings like a gymnast
          onto a clothesline, then flies through the air doing another
          of his spectacularly awkward four-armed and three-legged back-
          flips. He lands on the handle of one of the courtyard doors

                         AND SCREAMS:

                         ASH
          Ki-ya!
          Ash cyclone-chops the doorknob. The lock clicks. Ash's eyes
          light up.
          Ash drops to the ground. He digs a hole and burrows into the
          dirt as bullets fly everywhere. He breathes in through his
          nose and out through his mouth. Fox watches with his jaw
          hanging open.
          The courtyard doors smash apart and the rabid beagle tears
          out into the vegetable garden growling, foaming, and
          thrashing crazily. The farmers shriek and scream and run
          around, panicking, with their guns blazing.
          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson jump onto their
          motorcycle. The beagle rips the tail from Bean's neck, shreds
          it, chews it up, and swallows it. Fox deflates for an
          instant, then recovers. He looks to Ash on the back of the
          motorcycle, behind him, with his hands around Fox's waist. He
          says with the deepest affection and respect:

                         FOX
          Ash, that was pure, wild animal
          craziness. You're an athlete.
          Ash swallows. He beams. He sits up straighter.
          (NOTE: from this point onwards, an alternate version of Ash
          will be used which is slightly taller, slightly leaner, and
          animated slightly more gracefully.)
          Fox kick-starts the motorcycle and races across the farm.
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean scramble onto the roof of a car port
          with an old, white Mercedes convertible under it. The
          snarling beagle barks and snaps below them. They watch as:
          Fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the
          edge of the property. He guns the motor and yells:

                         FOX
          Holy swearing cuss!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Fox races the motorcycle up the apple cart, into the air, and
          over the concrete barricade. They land in the middle of the
          road, skidding, and speed off down the hill.

                         CUT TO:
          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean watching from the roof of the car
          port. Boggis turns to Bean and says, deadpan, needling him:

                         BOGGIS
          Franklin? You got any final twist for
          this plot?

                         BEAN

                         (PAUSE)
          Yeah!
          Bean grabs Boggis by the neck and throttles him. Bunce starts
          throwing punches. Bean holds him back by the forehead. Boggis
          kicks Bunce in the stomach. They brawl chaotically while the
          rabid beagle continues to go bananas below them.

                         CUT TO:
          Each fox-trap with a cobblestone missing underneath it and a
          hole in the ground. The old man with the grey moustache turns
          to his son and says with a strong French accent:

                         BADOIT
          Cuss.

          INT. SEWER SYSTEM. DAY

          Mrs. Fox sits anxiously at the bottom of her ladder. Badger,
          Weasel, Rickity, the two small rabbits, and the others sit,
          exhausted, in the dark cavern, passing a jar of cider. Mole

                         INTERRUPTS:

                         MOLE
          Stand by!
          Everyone looks to Mole. Mole is holding the tin can with the
          string attached to it to his ear. He nods and says urgently:

                         MOLE
          I just intercepted a high-frequency radio
          signal with the can --
          (gestures with the tin can)
          -- and I think they're on their way home!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Mrs. Fox jumps up, embraces Mole, and kisses him on the
          snout. Mole blushes.

                         CUT TO:
          Rabbit still running full-steam back into the village being
          pursued by the six farmhands. He comes to the manhole where
          they started and darts into it. The six farmhands stop at the
          manhole and look down. They go straight to the Nag's Head,
          walk inside, and close the door behind them.

          EXT. ROAD. DAY

          Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson ride down a country road.
          Kylie sees something across the meadow. He says warily:

                         KYLIE
          Don't turn around!

                         FOX
          What?
          Fox turns around. A huge, wild, grey wolf with ice-blue eyes
          stands on a rock fifty feet away from them. Fox slams on the
          brakes. The motorcycle slides to a halt.

                         FOX
          Where'd he come from?

                         (LOUDLY)
          Where'd you come from? What are you doing
          here?
          Pause. Fox points toward the wolf:

                         FOX
          Canis lupus!
          Fox points to himself:

                         FOX
          Vulpes Vulpes!
          The wolf does not answer. Fox, Kylie, Ash, and Kristofferson
          watch idling from the motorcycle.

                         FOX
          I don't think he speaks English or Latin.

                         (LOUDLY)
          Pensez-vous que 1'hiver sera rude?

                         (ASIDE)
          I'm asking if he thinks we're in for a
          hard winter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          The wolf shakes his head. Fox nods.

                         FOX
          He doesn't seem to know.
          Silence. Fox shouts to the wolf with a strange hitch in his

                         VOICE:

                         FOX
          I have a phobia of wolves!
          The wolf does not answer. It breathes heavily with its mouth
          open. Its teeth are long, sharp, and yellow. Its tongue hangs
          out, and its eyes are wild. Fox looks back at it with the
          identical expression for a minute, mesmerized -- then Fox
          closes his mouth and his eyes soften.
          Fox raises his paw in the air. The wolf blinks a few times.
          It raises its paw in the air. It turns away and trots off
          into the woods. Fox says wistfully:

                         FOX
          What a beautiful creature. Wish him luck,
          boys.
          Fox guns the motor. Gravel spits from under the spinning
          tires, and they tear off down the road. The shot booms down
          into the ground, below the grass, through buried pebbles,
          layers of soil, and subterranean mineral deposits.

                         TITLE:
          THREE DAYS LATER (2 1/2 Fox Weeks)
          The shot continues to descend past Badger and his family
          having dinner in a nicely furnished drain-pipe, past Rabbit
          and his family watching Magnum, P.I. on the stolen, portable
          television set in a well-appointed cement tunnel, past Beaver
          and Mrs. Beaver hosting Mole and Weasel for cocktails in a
          tasteful sewer-conduit.
          The shot stops in a small chamber adjacent to the brick
          cavern. The walls are filled with electrical cables, wires,
          pipes, and a large, new mural which depicts the Fox's former
          view of the valley as seen from their tree with a trompe
          1'oeil window-frame around it. It is signed Felicity Fox.
          Ash and Kristofferson sit Indian-style meditating on a
          braided rug. Mrs. Fox works mixing paints and turpentine at
          an easel in the corner. There is an armchair with a folded-up
          copy of the Gazette on its cushion in the center of the room
          under a glowing lamp. Classical music plays on a radio.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.
          Fox swings his head into the room from a tunnel. He says

                         GENTLY:

                         FOX
          My darlings?
          Everyone looks to Fox. He signals them to follow him.

          INT. DRAINPIPE. NIGHT

          The cement conduit with the iron grating above it. Fox and
          his family walk briskly down the pipe. A knitted, woolen,
          artificial tail has been sewn into the seat of Fox's
          trousers.

                         ASH
          Where are we going?

                         FOX
          Nobody knows.

                         ASH
          We were in the middle of a meditation
          practice.

                         FOX
          Watch your step.
          Fox takes everyone through an opening and starts climbing a
          metal ladder. He says theatrically:

                         FOX
          Let's see, now. Where does this lead?

          MRS. FOX
          Oh, no, Foxy. It's filthy.

                         FOX
          Keep a good grip, everyone.

                         ASH
          This better be worth it.

                         FOX
          I think I see a little sliver of light.
          What's this? Is that a door?

          MRS. FOX
          You're a terrible actor, Foxy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Do you smell something? Is that --

                         (SNIFFS TWICE)
          -- freon?

                         FOX
          Shh. I'm going to crack open this trap
          door and see if something's on the other
          side. I highly doubt it, though. There's
          probably just more sewer.
          Fox clears his throat. Pause.

                         FOX
          You know, wouldn't it be surprising if --

                         ASH
          Open it.
          Fox pushes open the trap door and crawls out. Everyone
          follows him.

          INT. SUPERMARKET. NIGHT

          Fox and his family stand in the middle of an aisle at the
          center of a large grocery store. To their left is the
          refrigerated section of milk, eggs, meat, fish, and cheese.
          To their right are canned goods, breakfast cereal, laundry
          detergent, rice, pasta, and condiments. The lights are half-
          dimmed, and a metal grate is closed over the front windows.
          There are no people. Fox says casually:

                         FOX
          Hey, look! There's a whole, enormous,
          glorious, gigantic supermarket up here!
          Ash and Kristofferson seem dumbstruck. Fox raises an eyebrow
          and smiles at Mrs. Fox. She puts her arm around his shoulder.

          MRS. FOX
          You really are kind of a quote-unquote
          fantastic fox.

                         FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          I try. I guess now that Kristofferson's
          dad's already down to single-pneumonia
          and getting better, he'll be going home
          soon, huh?

          MRS. FOX
          Actually, when he spoke to me from the
          hospital, he said he was already talking

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          MRS. FOX (cont'd)
          to Weasel about real-estate availabil-
          ities down in our sewer system.

                         FOX
          Oh, really? Well, now's the time to buy.
          Kylie comes around the end of the aisle pushing a miniature
          shopping cart filled with jars of jelly, jam, olives,
          pickles, and honey, plus three loaves of bread, Band-Aids,
          toothpaste, and a carton of strawberry ice cream. He says

                         BRIGHTLY:

                         KYLIE
          Did I hear my name?

                         FOX

                         (SMILING)
          Not down here, you didn't.

                         KYLIE

                         (SMILING BLANKLY)
          Why not?

                         FOX
          Because we were talking about other
          things.

                         KYLIE

                         (RESIGNED)
          Oh, well.
          Fox looks at Ash, who is studying a twelve-pack of tropical
          juice punch-boxes.

                         FOX
          The white cape rather suits him, doesn't
          it? Actually, I had to do quite a bit of
          searching myself before I found a look
          that really flattered me. Remember those
          horseshoe cuff-links?
          Fox and Mrs. Fox crack-up laughing. Fox notices something and
          stops. He stares at Mrs. Fox strangely. She is glowing. She
          hesitates. She shrugs.

          MRS. FOX
          I'm pregnant again.
          Fox is confused and moved. He holds Mrs. Fox's face in his
          paws. She smiles. Ash interrupts:

                         ASH
          Dad?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          Fox and Mrs. Fox look to Ash. An empty punch-box lies on its
          side behind him with a straw sticking out of it. There is a
          huge, purple stain all over the front of his white shirt.

                         ASH
          Should we dance?
          Pause. Everyone breaks out giddily dancing an ecstatic jig.
          Kylie waltzes the cart in circles. Fox spins Mrs. Fox.

                         CUT TO:
          A wide shot of all sixteen aisles of the supermarket stacked
          with boxes, cartons, cans, bottles, bags, and jars of every
          possible variety of food. The family of foxes continues to
          dance at the distant end of the center aisle.

          EXT. STREET. DAY

          Boggis, Bunce, and Bean sit silently in folding metal chairs
          around the manhole. Boggis's carbine rests across his lap.
          Bunce's shotgun hangs from a strap over his shoulder. Bean
          cleans his Luger. Petey sits on a cider box outside the Nag's
          Head strumming his guitar in the background. The bartender
          pulls the shutters shut and flips a sign on the door to
          Closed. Petey starts singing his song as the credits roll.
          The sun sets. The farmers sit waiting in the dark.
FARGO

 

                                   FARGO
                              a screenplay by
                                Ethan Coen
                                    and
                                 Joel Coen

	The following text fades in over black:

	This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place
	in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names
	have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been
	told exactly as it occured.

	FLARE TO WHITE

	FADE IN FROM WHITE

	Slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white
	particles wave over a white background.  A snowfall.

	A car bursts through the curtain of snow.

	The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car,
	a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales
	sticker showing in its rear window.

	As the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft,
	the title of the film fades in.

				FARGO

	Green highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD,
	MINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities
	diverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another
	just after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412.

	The car pulls into a Rodeway Inn.

	HOTEL LOBBY

	A man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch,
	goes to the reception desk.  The clerk is an older woman.

				CLERK
		And how are you today, sir?

				MAN
		Real good now.  I'm checking in
		- Mr. Anderson.

	The man prints "Jerry Lundega" onto a registration card,
	then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print
	"Anderson."

	As she types into a computer:

				CLERK
		Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're
		still planning on staying with
		us just the night, then?

				ANDERSON
		You bet.

	HOTEL ROOM

	The man turns on the TV, which shows the local evening news.

				NEWS ANCHOR
		- whether they will go to summer
		camp at all.  Katie Jensen has
		more.

				KATIE
		It was supposed to be a project
		funded by the city council;  it
		was supposed to benefit those
		Fargo-Moorehead children who
		would otherwise not be able to
		afford to attend a lakeshore
		summer camp.  But nobody consulted
		city controller Stu Jacobson...

	CHAIN RESTAURANT

	Anderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner.  Muzak
	plays.  A middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of
	regular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other.

				WAITRESS
		Can I warm that up for ya there?

				ANDERSON
		You bet.

	The man looks at his watch.

	THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

	We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story
	brick building.  Broken neon at the top of the building
	identifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern.  A troll, also in
	neon, holds a champagne glass aloft.

	INSIDE

	The bar is downscale even for this town.  Country music
	plays on the jukebox.

	Two men are seated in a booth at the back.  One is short,
	slight, youngish.  The other man is somewhat older, and
	dour.  The table in front of them is littered with empty
	long-neck beer bottles.  The ashtray is full.

	Anderson approaches.

				ANDERSON
		I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -

				YOUNGER MAN
		You're Jerry Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -

				YOUNGER MAN
		Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
		What gives, man?

				JERRY
		Shep said 8:30.

				YOUNGER MAN
		We been sitting here an hour.
		I've peed three times already.

				JERRY
		I'm sure sorry.  I - Shep told
		me 8:30.  It was a mix-up, I
		guess.

				YOUNGER MAN
		Ya got the car?

				JERRY
		Yah, you bet.  It's in the lot
		there.  Brand-new burnt umber
		Ciera.

				YOUNGER MAN
		Yeah, okay.  Well, siddown then.
		I'm Carl Showalter and this is
		my associate Gaear Grimsrud.

				JERRY
		Yah, how ya doin'.  So, uh, we
		all set on this thing, then?

				YOUNGER MAN
		Sure, Jerry, we're all set.  Why
		wouldn't we be?

				JERRY
		Yah, no, I'm sure you are.  Shep
		vouched for you and all.  I got
		every confidence in you fellas.

	They stare at him.  An awkward beat.

				JERRY
		...  So I guess that's it, then.
		Here's the keys -

				CARL
		No, that's not it, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Huh?

				CARL
		The new vehicle, plus forty
		thousand dollars.

				JERRY
		Yah, but the deal was, the car
		first, see, then the forty
		thousand, like as if it was the
		ransom.  I thought Shep told you -

				CARL
		Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Well, okay, it's -

				CARL
		Except that you were gonna be
		here at 7:30.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

				CARL
		Yeah, you already said that.

				JERRY
		Yah.  But it's not a whole pay-
		in-advance deal.  I give you a
		brand-new vehicle in advance and -

				CARL
		I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Okay.

				CARL
		I'm not gonna sit here and debate.
		I will say this though:  what Shep
		told us didn't make a whole lot
		of sense.

				JERRY
		Oh, no, it's real sound.  It's
		all worked out.

				CARL
		You want your own wife kidnapped?

				JERRY
		Yah.

	Carl Stares.  Jerry looks blankly back.

				CARL
		...  You - my point is, you pay
		the ransom - what eighty thousand
		bucks? -  I mean, you give us
		half the ransom, forty thousand,
		you keep half.  It's like robbing
		Peter to play Paul, it doesn't
		make any -

				JERRY
		Okay, it's - see, it's not me
		payin' the ransom.  The thing is,
		my wife, she's wealthy - her dad,
		he's real well off.  Now, I'm in
		a bit of trouble -

				CARL
		What kind of trouble are you in,
		Jerry?

				JERRY
		Well, that's, that's, I'm not go
		inta, inta - see, I just need
		money.  Now, her dad's real
		wealthy -

				CARL
		So why don't you just ask him
		for the money?

	Grimsrud, the dour man who has not yet spoken, now softly
	puts in with a Swedish-accented voice:

				GRIMSRUD
		Or your fucking wife, you know.

				CARL
		Or your fucking wife, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Well, it's all just part of this -
		they don't know I need it, see.
		Okay, so there's that.  And even
		if they did, I wouldn't get it.
		So there's that on top, then.  See,
		these're personal matters.

				CARL
		Personal matters.

				JERRY
		Yah.  Personal matters that
		needn't, uh -

				CARL
		Okay, Jerry.  You're tasking us
		to perform this mission, but you,
		you won't, uh, you won't - aw,
		fuck it, let's take a look at
		that Ciera.

	MINNEAPOLIS SUBURBAN HOUSE

	Jerry enters through the kitchen door, in a parka and a red
	plaid Elmer Fudd hat.  He stamps snow off his feet.  He is
	carrying a bag of groceries which he deposits on the kitchen
	counter.

				JERRY
		Hon?  Got the growshries.

				VOICE
		Thank you, hon.  How's Fargo?

				JERRY
		Yah, real good.

				VOICE
		Dad's here.

	DEN

	Jerry enters, pulling off his plaid cap.

				JERRY
		How ya doin', Wade?

	Wade Gustafson is mid-sixtyish, vigorous, with a full head
	of gray hair.  His eyes remain fixed on the TV.

				WADE
		Yah, pretty good.

				JERRY
		Whatcha watchin' there?

				WADE
		Norstars.

				JERRY
		...  Who they playin'?

				WADE
		OOOoooh!

	His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.

	KITCHEN

	Jerry walks back in, taking off his coat.  His wife is
	putting on an apron.  Jerry nods toward the living room.

				JERRY
		Is he stayin' for supper, then?

				WIFE
		Yah, I think so...  Dad, are you
		stayin' for supper?

				WADE
			(off)
		Yah.

	DINING ROOM

	Jerry, his wife, Wade and Scotty, twelve years old, sit
	eating.

				SCOTTY
		May I be excused?

				JERRY
		Sure, ya done there?

				SCOTTY
		Uh-huh.  Goin' out.

				WIFE
		Where are you going?

				SCOTTY
		Just out.  Just McDonald's.

				JERRY
		Back at 9:30.

				SCOTTY
		Okay.

				WADE
		He just ate.  And he didn't finish.
		He's going to McDonald's instead
		of finishing here?

				WIFE
		He sees his friends there.  It's
		okay.

				WADE
		It's okay?  McDonald's?  What do
		you think they do there?  They
		don't drink milkshakes, I assure
		you!

				WIFE
		It's okay, Dad.

				JERRY
		Wade, have ya had a chance to
		think about, uh, that deal I was
		talkin' about, those forty acres
		there on Wayzata?

				WADE
		You told me about it.

				JERRY
		Yah, you said you'd have a think
		about it.  I understand it's a
		lot of money -

				WADE
		A heck of a lot.  What'd you
		say you were gonna put there?

				JERRY
		A lot.  It's a limited -

				WADE
		I know it's a lot.

				JERRY
		I mean a parking lot.

				WADE
		Yah, well, seven hundred and
		fifty thousand dollars is a lot
		- ha ha ha!

				JERRY
		Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -

				WADE
		I thought you were gonna show
		it to Stan Grossman.  He passes
		on this stuff before it gets
		kicked up to me.

				JERRY
		Well, you know Stan'll say no
		dice.  That's why you pay him.
		I'm asking you here, Wade.  This
		could work out real good for me
		and Jean and Scotty -

				WADE
		Jean and Scotty never have to
		worry.

	WHITE

	A black like curls through the white.  Twisting perspective
	shows that it is an aerial shot of a two-lane highway,
	bordered by snowfields.  The highway carries one moving car.

	INT. CAR

	Carl Showalter is driving.  Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly
	out.

	After a long beat:

				GRIMSRUD
		Where is Pancakes Hause?

				CARL
		What?

				GRIMSRUD
		We stop at Pancakes Hause.

				CARL
		What're you, nuts?  We had
		pancakes for breakfast.  I gotta
		go somewhere I can get a shot
		and a beer - and a steak maybe.
		Not more fuckin' pancakes.  Come
		on.

	Grimsrud gives him a sour look.

				CARL
		...  Come on, man.  Okay, here's
		an idea.  We'll stop outside of
		Brainerd.  I know a place there
		we can get laid.  Wuddya think?

				GRIMSRUD
		I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.

				CARL
		Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin',
		we'll stop for pancakes, then
		we'll get laid.  Wuddya think?

	GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	Jerry is sitting in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just
	off the showroom floor.  On the other side of his desk sit
	an irate customer and his wife.

				CUSTOMER
		We sat here right in this room and
		went over this and over this!

				JERRY
		Yah, but that TruCoat -

				CUSTOMER
		I sat right here and said I didn't
		want no TruCoat!

				JERRY
		Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat,
		you don't get it and you get
		oxidization problems.  It'll cost
		you a heck of lot more'n five
		hunnert -

				CUSTOMER
		You're sittin' here, you're talkin'
		in circles!  You're talkin' like
		we didn't go over this already!

				JERRY
		Yah, but this TruCoat -

				CUSTOMER
		We had us a deal here for nine-
		teen-five.  You sat there and
		darned if you didn't tell me
		you'd get this car, these options,
		WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nine-
		teen-five!

				JERRY
		Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -

				CUSTOMER
		You called me twenty minutes ago
		and said you had it!  Ready to
		make delivery, ya says!  Come on
		down and get it!  And here ya are
		and you're wastin' my time and
		you're wastin' my wife's time and
		I'm payin' nineteen-five for this
		vehicle here!

				JERRY
		Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...

	He rises, and, as he leaves:

				JERRY
		...  See, they install that TruCoat
		at the factory, there's nothin' we
		can do, but I'll talk to my boss.

	The couple watch him go to a nearby cubicle.

				CUSTOMER
		These guys here - these guys!
		It's always the same!  It's always
		more!  He's a liar!

				WIFE
		Please, dear.

				CUSTOMER
		We went over this and over this -

	NEARBY CUBICLE

	Jerry sits perched on the desk of another salesman who is
	eating lunch as he watches a hockey game on a small portable
	TV.

				JERRY
		So you're goin' to the Gophers
		on Sunday?

				SALESMAN
		You bet.

				JERRY
		You wouldn't have an extra ticket
		there?

				SALESMAN
		They're playin' the Buckeyes!

				JERRY
		Yah.

				SALESMAN
		Ya kiddin'!

	JERRY'S CUBICLE

	Jerry re-enters.

				JERRY
		Well, he never done this before,
		but seein' as it's special
		circumstances and all, he says I
		can knock one hunnert off that
		TruCoat.

				CUSTOMER
		One hundred!  You lied to me, Mr.
		Lundegaard.  You're a bald-faced
		liar!

	Jerry sits staring at his lap.

				CUSTOMER
		...  A fucking liar -

				WIFE
		Bucky, please!

	Jerry mumbles into his lap:

				JERRY
		One hunnert's the best we can
		do here.

				CUSTOMER
		Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my
		goddamn checkbook.  Let's get this
		over with.

	WIDE EXTERIOR:  TRUCK STOP

	There is a restaurant with many big rigs parked nearby, and
	a motel with an outsize Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox
	flanking its sign:  BLUE OX MOTEL.

	MOTEL ROOM

	Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are in the twin beds
	having sex with two truck-stop hookers.

				CARL
		Oh, Jesus, yeah.

				HIS HOOKER
		There ya go, sugar.

				GRIMSRUD
		Nnph.

				HIS HOOKER
		Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

	LATER

	The couples like in their respective beds, gazing at the
	offscreen TV.

				ED MCMAHON
		-  Johnny's guests tonight will be
		Lee Majors, George Wendt, and Steve
		Boutsikaros from the San Diego Zoo,
		so keep that dial -

	LUNDEGAARD KITCHEN

	We hear a morning show on television.  Jean Lundegaard is
	making coffee in the kitchen as Scott eats cereal at the
	table.

				JEAN
		I'm talkin' about your potential.

				SCOTT
			(absently)
		Uh-huh.

				JEAN
		You're not a C student.

				SCOTT
		Uhn.

				JEAN
		And yet you're gettin' C grades.
		It's this disparity there that
		concerns your dad and me.

				SCOTT
		Uh-huh.

				JEAN
		You know what a disparity is?

				SCOTT
			(testily)
		Yeah!

				JEAN
		Okay.  Well, that's why we don't
		want ya goin' out fer hockey.

				SCOTT
		Oh, man!

	The phone rings.

				SCOTT
		...  What's the big deal?  It's
		an hour -

				JEAN
		Hold on.

	She picks up the phone.

				JEAN
		...  Hello?

				PHONE VOICE
		Yah, hiya, hon.

				JEAN
		Oh, hiya, Dad.

				WADE
		Jerry around?

				JEAN
		Yah, he's still here - I'll
		catch him for ya.

	She holds the phone away and calls:

				JEAN
		...  Hon?

				VOICE
		Yah.

				JEAN
		It's Dad.

				VOICE
		Yah...

	Jerry enters in shirtsleeves and tie.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, okay...

				SCOTT
		Look, Dad, there is no fucking
		way -

				JEAN
		Scott!

				JERRY
		Say, let's watch the language -

	He takes the phone.

				JERRY
		How ya doin', Wade?

				WADE
		What's goin' on there?

				JERRY
		Oh, nothing, Wade.  How ya doin'
		there?

				WADE
		Stan Grossman looked at your
		proposal.  Says it's pretty
		sweet.

				JERRY
		No kiddin'?

				WADE
		We might be innarested.

				JERRY
		No kiddin'!  I'd need the cash
		pretty quick there.  In order
		to close the deal.

				WADE
		Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk
		about it.  If your numbers are
		right, Stan says its pretty
		sweet.  Stan Grossman.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		2:30.

	Click.  Dial tone.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay.

	GUSTAFSON OLD GARAGE

	Jerry wanders through the service area where cars are being
	worked on.  He stops by an Indian in blue jeans who is
	looking at the underside of a car that sits on a hydraulic
	lift with a cage light hanging off its innards.

				JERRY
		Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?

				SHEP
		Mm.

				JERRY
		Say, ya know those two fellas
		ya put me in touch with, up
		there in Fargo?

				SHEP
		Put you in touch with Grimsrud.

				JERRY
		Well, yah, but he had a buddy
		there.  He, uh -

				SHEP
		Well, I don't vouch for him.

				JERRY
		Well, that's okay, I just -

				SHEP
		I vouch for Grimsrud.  Who's his
		buddy?

				JERRY
		Carl somethin'?

				SHEP
		Never heard of him.  Don't vouch
		for him.

				JERRY
		Well, that's okay, he's a buddy
		of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm
		not worryin'.  I just, I was
		wonderin', see, I gotta get in
		touch with 'em for, I might not
		need it anymore, sumpn's happenin',
		see -

				SHEP
		Call 'em up.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, see, I did that, and
		I haven't been able to get 'em,
		so I thought you maybe'd know an
		alternate number or what have ya.

				SHEP
		Nope.

	Jerry slaps his fist into his open palm and snaps his
	fingers.

				JERRY
		Okay, well, real good, then.

	CAR

	Carl is driving.  Grimsrud stares out front.

	After a beat:

				CARL
		...  Look at that.  Twin Cities.
		IDS Building, the big glass one.
		Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.
		After the Sears, uh, Chicago...
		You never been to Minneapolis?

				GRIMSRUD
		No.

				CARL
		...  Would it kill you to say
		something?

				GRIMSRUD
		I did.

				CARL
		"No." First thing you've said
		in the last four hours.  That's
		a, that's a fountain of conversation,
		man.  That's a geyser.  I mean, whoa,
		daddy, stand back, man.  Shit, I'm
		sittin' here driving, man, doin'
		all the driving, whole fuckin' way
		from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to,
		you know, tryin' to chat, keep
		our spirits up, fight the boredom
		of the road, and you can't say one
		fucking thing just in the way of
		conversation.

	Grimsurd smokes, gazing out the window.

				CARL
		...  Well, fuck it, I don't have
		to talk either, man.  See how
		you like it...

	He drives.

				CARL
		...  Total silence...

	JERRY'S CUBICLE

	He is on the phone.

				JERRY
		Yah, real good.  How you doin'?

				VOICE
		Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.
		You're damned hard to get on the
		phone.

				JERRY
		Yah, it's pretty darned busy here,
		but that's the way we like it.

				VOICE
		That's for sure.  Now, I just
		need, on these last, these financing
		documents you sent us, I can't
		read the serial numbers of the
		vehicles on here, so I -

				JERRY
		But I already got the, it's okay,
		the loans are in place, I already
		got the, the what, the -

				VOICE
		Yeah, the three hundred and twenty
		thousand dollars, you got the money
		last month.

				JERRY
		Yah, so we're all set.

				VOICE
		Yeah, but the vehicles you were
		borrowing on, I just can't read
		the serial numbers on your
		applicaton.  Maybe if you could
		just read them to me -

				JERRY
		But the deal's already done, I
		already got the money -

				VOICE
		Yeah, but we have an audit here,
		I just have to know that these
		vehicles you're financing with
		this money, that they really
		exist.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, they exist all right.

				VOICE
		I'm sure they do - ha ha!  But
		I can't read their serial numbers
		here.  So if you could read me -

				JERRY
		Well, but see, I don't have 'em
		in front a me - why don't I just
		fax you over a copy -

				VOICE
		No, fax is no good, that's what
		I have and I can't read the darn
		thing -

				JERRY
		Yah, okay, I'll have my girl
		send you over a copy, then.

				VOICE
		Okay, because if I can't correlate
		this note with the specific vehicles,
		then I gotta call back that money -

				JERRY
		Yah, how much money was that?

				VOICE
		Three hundred and twenty thousand
		dollars.  See, I gotta correlate
		that money with the cars it's being
		lent on.

				JERRY
		Yah, no problem, I'll just fax
		that over to ya, then.

				VOICE
		No, no, fax is -

				JERRY
		I mean send it over.  I'll shoot
		it right over to ya.

				VOICE
		Okay.

				JERRY
		Okay, real good, then.

	CLOSE ON TELEVISION

	A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a
	kitchen set.

				HOST
		So I seperate the - how the heck
		do I get the egg out of the shell
		without breaking it?

	Jean Lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of
	coffee, watching the television.

				HOSTESS
		You just prick a little hole in
		the end and blow!

	Jean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio
	audience.  She hears something else - a faint scraping sound
	- and looks up.

				HOST
		Okay, here goes nothing.

	The scraping sound persists.  Jean sets down her coffee cup
	and rises.

	From the studio audience:

				AUDIENCE
		Awoooo!

	KITCHEN

	We track toward the back door.  A curtain is stretched tight
	across its window.

	Jean pulls the curtain back.  Bright sunlight amplified by
	snow floods in.

	A man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock.

	Jean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into -

	- a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house.

	We hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed.

	The tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jean's wrist.

	She screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps
	her gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites
	down hard.

	He drops her wrist.  As Carl enters, she races up the
	stairs.

				GRIMSRUD
		Unguent.

				CARL
		Huh?

	Grimsurd looks at his thumb.

				GRIMSRUD
		I need ... unguent.

	UPSTAIRS BEDROOM

	As the two men enter, a door at the far side is slamming
	shut.  A cord snakes in under the door.

	MASTER BATHROOM

	Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess
	phone.

	The phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile
	floor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its
	cord ripped free.

	With a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.

	BEDROOM

	Grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door
	and frame, and is working it.

	BATHROOM

	Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it
	open.  Snow that had drifted against the window sifts
	lightly in.  Jean steps up onto the toilet.

	The door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.

	Jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to
	the tank.

	The groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob
	splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor.

	The door swings open.

	Grimsrud and Carl enter.

	THEIR POV

	Room empty, window open.

	Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out.

	Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps
	aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent.

	He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing
	something in the mirror.

	The shower curtain is drawn around the tub.

	He steps toward it.

	As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated
	by thrashing limbs.

	Jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its
	rings and stumbles out into the bedroom.  Grimsrud follows.

	BEDROOM

	Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain
	but awkwardly trying to push it off.

	UPSTAIRS LANDING

	Still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,
	trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the
	stairs.

	Grimsrud trots down after her.

	A PLAQUE:  WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED

	INT. WADE'S OFFICE

	Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry
	enters.

				JERRY
		How ya doin' there, Stan?  How
		are ya, Wade?

	Stan Grossman shakes his hand.

				STAN
		Good to see ya again, Jerry.  If
		these numbers are right, this
		looks pretty sweet.

				JERRY
		Oh, those numbers are all right,
		bleemee.

				WADE
		This is do-able.

				STAN
		Congratulations, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -

				WADE
		What kind of finder's fee were
		you looking for?

				JERRY
		...  Huh?

				STAN
		The financials are pretty thorough,
		so the only thing we don't know
		is your fee.

				JERRY
		...  My fee?  Wade, what the
		heck're you talkin' about?

				WADE
		Stan and I're okay.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		We're good to loan in.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		But we never talked about your
		fee for bringin' it to us.

				JERRY
		No, but, Wade, see, I was
		bringin' you this deal for you
		to loan me the money to put
		in.  It's my deal here, see?

	Wade scowls, looks at Stan.

				STAN
		Jerry - we thought you were
		bringin' us an investment.

				JERRY
		Yah, right -

				STAN
		You're sayin' - what're you
		sayin'?

				WADE
		You're sayin' that we put in
		all the money and you collect
		when it pays off?

				JERRY
		No, no.  I - I'd, I'd - pay you
		back the principal, and interest
		- heck, I'd go - one over prime -

				STAN
		We're not a bank, Jerry.

	Wade is angry.

				WADE
		What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted
		bank interest on seven hunnert'n
		fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest
		Federal.  Talk to Bill Diehl.

				STAN
		He's at Norstar.

				WADE
		He's at -

				JERRY
		No, see, I don't need a finder's
		fee, I need - finder's fee's, what,
		ten percent, heck that's not gonna
		do it for me.  I need the principal.

				STAN
		Jerry, we're not just going to
		give you seven hundred and fifty
		thousand dollars.

				WADE
		What the heck were you thinkin'?
		Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank
		interest, I'd look for complete
		security.  Heck, FDIC.  I don't
		see nothin' like that here.

				JERRY
		Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd
		guarantee ya your money back.

				WADE
		I'm not talkin' about your damn
		word, Jerry.  Geez, what the
		heck're you?...  Well, look, I
		don't want to cut you out of the
		loop, but his here's a good deal.
		I assume, if you're not innarested,
		you won't mind if we move on it
		independently.

	PARKING LOT

	We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.
	Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly
	out at his sides, his breath vaporizing.  He goes to his
	car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper
	and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice
	that has developed on his windshield.

	The scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air.

	Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the
	windshield and the hood of his car.

	The tantrum passes.  Jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing
	in particular.

	Scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the
	windshield.

	FRONT DOOR

	A beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock.

	The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about,
	holding a sack of groceries.

				JERRY
		Hon?

	He shuts the door.

				JERRY
		...  Got the growshries...

	He has already seen the shower curtain on the floor.  He
	frowns, pokes at it with his foot.

				JERRY
		...  Hon?

	UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

	Jerry walks in.  He sets the groceries down on the toilet
	tank.

	He looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts
	in.  He shuts it.

	He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink,
	frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.

	He looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings.

	FOYER

	Once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain.

	From another room:

				JERRY
		Yah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I.

	Then, slightly more agitated.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's
		Jerry...

	Beat.

				JERRY
		...  Wade, it's Jerry, I - we
		gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible...

	Beat.

	LIVING ROOM

	Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a
	telephone.

	After a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in
	a number.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.

	BLACK

	Hold in black.

	A slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large
	paper-mache figure into frame.  It is a flannel-shirt
	woodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder.  As
	we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing
	tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a
	pedestal.

	A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal:
	WELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN.

	The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the
	background.  The two-lane highway is otherwise empty.

	INT. CAR

	Carl drives.  Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window.
	From the back seat we hear whimpering.

	Grimsrud turns to look.

	Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a
	tarpaulin.

				GRIMSRUD
		Shut the fuck up or I'll throw
		you back in the trunk, you know.

				CARL
		Geez.  That's more'n I've heard
		you say all week.

	Grimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window.

	At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear
	window.  Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on
	his gumballs.

	Carl eases the car onto the shoulder.

				CARL
		Ah, shit, the tags...

	Grimsrud looks at him.

				CARL
		...  It's just the tags.  I never
		put my tags on the car.  Don't
		worry, I'll take care of this.

	He looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on
	the gravel shoulder.

				CARL
		...  Let's keep still back there,
		lady, or we're gonna have to, ya
		know, to shoot ya.

	Grimsrud stares at Carl.

				CARL
		...  Hey!  I'll take care of this!

	Both cars have stopped.  Carl looks up at the rear-view
	mirror.

	The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them,
	writing in his citation book.

	Carl watches.

	We hear the trooper's door open.

	The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly
	on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night
	air.

	Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up.

				CARL
		How can I help you, officer?

	The trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time.

	Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.

	Finally:

				TROOPER
		This is a new car, then, sir?

				CARL
		It certainly is, officer.  Still
		got that smell!

				TROOPER
		You're required to display
		temporary tags, either in the
		plate area or taped inside the
		back window.

				CARL
		Certainly -

				TROOPER
		Can I see your license and
		registration please?

				CARL
		Certainly.

	He reaches for his wallet.

				CARL
		...  I was gonna tape up the
		temporary tag, ya know, to be
		in full compliance, but it, uh,
		it, uh ... must a slipped my
		mind...

	He extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty-
	dollar bill protruding from it.

				CARL
		...  So maybe the best thing
		would be to take care of that,
		right here in Brainerd.

				TROOPER
		What's this, sir?

				CARL
		That's my license and regis-
		tration.  I wanna be in
		compliance.

	He forces a laugh.

				CARL
		...  I was just thinking I could
		take care of it right here.  In
		Brainerd.

	The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold
	and hands the billfold back into the car.

				TROOPER
		Put that back in your pocket,
		please.

	Carl's nervous smile fades.

				TROOPER
		...  And step out of the car,
		please, sir.

	Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.

	There is a whimpering sound.

	The policeman hesitates.

	Another sound.

	The policeman leans forward into the car, listening.

	Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair
	and slams his head down onto the car door.

	The policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and
	throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car.

	With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment.  He
	brings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG -
	into the back of the trooper's head.

	Jean screams.

				GRIMSRUD
		Shut up.

	He releases the policeman.

	The policeman's head slides out the window and his body
	flops back onto the street.

	Carl looks out at the cop in the road.

				CARL
			(softly)
		Whoa...  Whoa, Daddy.

	Grimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails
	it out the open window.

				GRIMSRUD
		You'll take care of it.  Boy, you
		are smooth smooth, you know.

				CARL
		Whoa, Daddy.

	Jean, for some reason, screams again.  Then stops.

				GRIMSRUD
		Clear him off the road.

				CARL
		Yeah.

	He gets out.

	EXT. ROAD

	Carl leans down to hoist up the body.

	Headlights appear:  an oncoming car.

	INT. CIERA

	Grimsrud notices.

	EXT. ROAD

	The car approaches, slowing.

	Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen
	in the headlights.

	The car accelerates and roars past and away.  We just make
	out the silhouettes of two occupants in front.

	INT. CIERA

	Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat.  He squeals into a U-
	turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin.

	Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead.  The pursued car
	churns up fine snow.

	Grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in
	his ashtray.  We hear the churning of the car wheels and the
	pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside.

	In the back seat, Jean starts screaming.

	Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights.

	He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.

	The red tail lights ahead start to turn.  With a distant
	crunching sound, they disappear.

	The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn.

	Grimsrud frowns and slows.

	His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled
	around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn.

	Grimsrud brakes.

	Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell.

	Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his
	door and gets out.

	EXT. ROAD

	The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield
	abutting the highway.  A young man in a down parka is
	limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car.

	Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy.  He
	raises his gun and fires.

	With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back
	and he pitches into the snow.

	Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open
	door.

	A young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage,
	injured.

	Snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck.

	Grimsrud raises his gun and fires.

	AN OIL PAINTING

	A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland.  The
	room in which it hangs is dark.  We hear off-screen snoring.

	We track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half-
	completed oil of a grey mallard.

	The continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping.  The
	man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied.  His
	mouth is agape.  He snores.  His arms are flung over a woman
	in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not
	snoring.

	We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and
	snoring.

	The phone rings.

	The woman stirs.

				WOMAN
		Oh, geez...

	She reaches for the phone.

				WOMAN
		...  Hi, it's Marge...

	The man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble.

				MARGE
		...  Oh, my.  Where?...  Yah...
		Oh, geez...

	The man sits up, gazes stupidly about.

				MARGE
		...  Okay.  There in a jif...
		Real good, then.

	She hangs up.

				MARGE
		...  You can sleep, hon.  It's
		early yet.

				MAN
		Gotta go?

				MARGE
		Yah.

	The man swings his legs out.

				MAN
		I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		That's okay, hon.  I gotta run.

				MAN
		Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.
		I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		Aw, you can sleep, hon.

				MAN
		Ya gotta eat a breakfast...

	He clears his throat with another deep rumble.

				MAN
		...  I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		Aw, Norm.

	PLATE

	Leavings of a huge plate of eggs, ham, toast.

	Wider, we see Marge now wearing a beige police uniform.  A
	patch on one arm says BRAINERD POLICE DEPARTMENT.  She wears
	a heavy belt holding a revolver, walkie-talkie and various
	other jangling police impedimenta.  Norm is in a dressing
	gown.

				MARGE
		Thanks, hon.  Time to shove off.

				NORM
		Love ya, Margie.

	As she struggles into a parka:

				MARGE
		Love ya, hon.

	He is exiting back to the bedroom; she exits out the front
	door.

	EXT. GUNDERSON HOUSE

	Dawn.  Marge is making her way down the icy front stoop to
	her prowler.

	INT. GUNDERSON HOUSE

	Norm sits back onto the bed, shrugging off his robe.  Off-
	screen we hear the front door open.

	FRONT DOOR

	Marge stamps the snow off her shoes.

				MARGE
		Hon?

				NORM
			(off)
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Prowler needs a jump.

	HIGHWAY

	Two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of
	the road, a pair of men inside each car.

	The first car's driver door opens and a figure in a parka
	emerges, holding two styrofoam cups.  His partner leans
	across the seat to close the door after him.

	The reverse shows Marge approaching from her own squad car.

				MARGE
		Hiya, Lou.

				LOU
		Margie.  Thought you might need
		a little warm-up.

	He hands her one of the cups of coffee.

				MARGE
		Yah, thanks a bunch.  So what's
		the deal, now?  Gary says triple
		homicide?

				LOU
		Yah, looks pretty bad.  Two
		of'm're over here.

	Marge looks around as they start walking.

				MARGE
		Where is everybody?

				LOU
		Well - it's cold, Margie.

	BY THE WRECK

	Laid out in the early morning light is the wrecked car, a
	pair of footprints leading out to a man in a bright orange
	parka face down in the bloodstained snow, and one pair of
	footsteps leading back to the road.

	Marge is peering into the car.

				MARGE
		Ah, geez.  So...  Aw, geez.
		Here's the second one...  It's
		in the head and the ... hand
		there, I guess that's a defensive
		wound.  Okay.

	Marge looks up from the car.

				MARGE
		...  Where's the state trooper?

	Lou, up on the shoulder, jerks his thumb.

				LOU
		Back there a good piece.  In
		the ditch next to his prowler.

	Marge looks around at the road.

				MARGE
		Okay, so we got a state trooper
		pulls someone over, we got a
		shooting, and these folks drive
		by, and we got a high-speed
		pursuit, ends here, and this
		execution-type deal.

				LOU
		Yah.

				MARGE
		I'd be very surprised if our
		suspect was from Brainerd.

				LOU
		Yah.

	Marge is studying the ground.

				MARGE
		Yah.  And I'll tell you what, from
		his footprints he looks like a big
		fella -

	Marge suddenly doubles over, putting her head between her
	knees down near the snow.

				LOU
		Ya see something down there, Chief?

				MARGE
		Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.

				LOU
		Geez, you okay, Margie?

				MARGE
		I'm fine - it's just morning
		sickness.

	She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees.

				MARGE
		...  Well, that passed.

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah.  Now I'm hungry again.

				LOU
		You had breakfast yet, Margie?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah.  Norm made some eggs.

				LOU
		Yah?  Well, what now, d'ya think?

				MARGE
		Let's go take a look at that
		trooper.

	BY THE STATE TROOPER'S CAR

	Marge's prowler is parked nearby.

	Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch,
	again looking at footprints in the snow.  She calls up to
	the road:

				MARGE
		There's two of 'em, Lou!

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah, this guy's smaller than
		his buddy.

				LOU
		Oh, yah?

	DOWN IN THE DITCH

	In the foreground is the head of the state trooper, facing
	us.  Peering at it from behind, still on her hands and
	knees, is Marge.

				MARGE
		For Pete's sake.

	She gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out
	of the ditch.

				LOU
		How's it look, Marge?

				MARGE
		Well, he's got his gun on his hip
		there, and he looks like a nice
		enough guy.  It's a real shame.

				LOU
		Yah.

				MARGE
		You haven't monkeyed with his car
		there, have ya?

				LOU
		No way.

	She is looking at the prowler, which still idles on the
	shoulder.

				MARGE
		Somebody shut his lights.  I guess
		the little guy sat in there, waitin'
		for his buddy t'come back.

				LOU
		Yah, woulda been cold out here.

				MARGE
		Heck, yah.  Ya think, is Dave open
		yet?

				LOU
		You don't think he's mixed up in -

				MARGE
		No, no, I just wanna get Norm some
		night crawlers.

	INT. PROWLER

	Marge is driving; Lou sits next to her.

				MARGE
		You look in his citation book?

				LOU
		Yah...

	He looks at his notebook.

				LOU
		...  Last vehicle he wrote in
		was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.
		Under the plate number he put
		DLR - I figure they stopped him
		or shot him before he could finish
		fillin' out the tag number.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				LOU
		So I got the state lookin' for a
		Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.
		They don't got no match yet.

				MARGE
		I'm not sure I agree with you a
		hunnert percent on your policework,
		there, Lou.

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah, I think that vehicle there
		probly had dealer plates.  DLR?

				LOU
		Oh...

	Lou gazes out the window, thinking.

				LOU
		...  Geez.

				MARGE
		Yah.  Say, Lou, ya hear the one
		about the guy who couldn't afford
		personalized plates, so he went
		and changed his name to J2L 4685?

				LOU
		Yah, that's a good one.

				MARGE
		Yah.

	THE ROAD

	The police car enters with a whoosh and hums down a straight-
	ruled empty highway, cutting a landscape of flat and perfect
	white.

	EMBERS FAMILY RESTAURANT

	Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit in a booth, sipping
	coffee.  Outside the window, snow falls from a gunmetal sky.

				WADE
		-  All's I know is, ya got a
		problem, ya call a professional!

				JERRY
		No!  They said no cops!  They were
		darned clear on that, Wade!  They
		said you call the cops and we -

				WADE
		Well, a course they're gonna say
		that!  But where's my protection?
		They got Jean here!  I give these
		sons a bitches a million dollars,
		where's my guarantee they're gonna
		let her go.

				JERRY
		Well, they -

				WADE
		A million dollars is a lot a damn
		money!  And there they are, they
		got my daughter!

				JERRY
		Yah, but think this thing through
		here, Wade.  Ya give 'em what they
		want, why wont' they let her go?
		You gotta listen to me on this one,
		Wade.

				WADE
		Heck, you don't know!  You're just
		whistlin' Dixie here!  I'm sayin',
		the cops, they can advise us on
		this!  I'm sayin' call a professional!

				JERRY
		No!  No cops!  That's final!  This
		is my deal here, Wade!  Jean is
		my wife here!

				STAN
		I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin'
		to Jerry's viewpoint here.

				WADE
		Well -

				STAN
		We gotta protect Jean.  These -
		we're not holdin' any cards here,
		Wade, they got all of 'em.  So
		they call the shots.

				JERRY
		You're darned tootin'!

				WADE
		Ah, dammit!

				STAN
		I'm tellin' ya.

				WADE
		Well...  Why don't we...

	He saws a finger under his nose.

				WADE
		...  Stan, I'm thinkin' we should
		offer 'em half a million.

				JERRY
		Now come on here, no way, Wade!
		No way!

				STAN
		We're not horse-trading here, Wade,
		we just gotta bite the bullet on
		this thing.

				JERRY
		Yah!

				STAN
		What's the next step here, Jerry?

				JERRY
		They're gonna call, give me
		instructions for a drop.  I'm
		supposed to have the money ready
		tomorrow.

				WADE
		Dammit!

	THE CASHIER

	She rings up two dollars forty.

				CASHIER
		How was everything today?

				JERRY
		Yah, real good now.

	PARKING LOT

	Snow continues to fall.  Jerry and Stan stand bundled in
	their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles.
	Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for
	Stan.

				STAN
		Okay.  We'll get the money together.
		Don't worry about it, Jerry.  Now,
		d'you want anyone at home, with you,
		until they call?

				JERRY
		No, I - they don't want - they're
		just s'posed to be dealin' with
		me, they were real clear.

				STAN
		Yah.

	Jerry pounds his mittened hands together against the cold.

				JERRY
		Ya know, they said no one listenin'
		in, they'll be watchin', ya know.
		Maybe it's all bull, but like you
		said, Stan, they're callin' the
		shots.

				STAN
		Okay.  And Scotty, is he gonna
		be all right?

				JERRY
		Yah, geez, Scotty.  I'll go talk
		to him.

	There is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the
	Lincoln.

				STAN
		We'll call.

	The Lincoln spits snow as it grinds out of the lot and
	fishtails out onto the boulevard.

	SCOTTY'S BEDROOM

	Scotty lies on the bed, weeping.  Jerry enters and perches
	uncomfortably on the edge of his bed.

				JERRY
		...  How ya doin' there, Scotty?

				SCOTT
		Dad!  What're they doing?  Wuddya
		think they're doin' with Mom?

				JERRY
		It's okay, Scotty.  They're not
		gonna want to hurt her any.
		These men, they just want money,
		see.

				SCOTT
		What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?

				JERRY
		No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here.
		Grandad and I, we're - we're makin'
		sure this gets handled right.

	Scott snorfles and sits up.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I really think we should call
		the cops.

				JERRY
		No!  We can't let anyone know about
		this thing!  We gotta play ball with
		these guys - you ask Stan Grossman,
		he'll tell ya the same thing!

				SCOTT
		Yeah, but -

				JERRY
		We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but
		we gotta play ball.  Ya know, that's
		the deal.  Now if Lorraine calls, or
		Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in
		Florida with Pearl and Marty...

	Scotty starts to weep again.  Jerry stares down at his lap.

				JERRY
		...  That's the best we can do here.

	EXT. CABIN

	It is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white.  A brown Ciera
	with dealer plates is pulling into the drive.

	Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out
	of the driver's.  Grimsrud opens the back door and, with an
	arm on her elbow, helps Jean out.  She has her hands tied
	behind her and a black hood over her head.

	With a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and
	lurches away across the front lawn.  Grimsrud moves to
	retrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his
	shoulder.

				CARL
		Hold it.

	They both look out at the front lawn, Grimsrud
	expressionless, Carl smiling.

	With muffled cries, the hooded woman lurches across the
	unbroken snow, staggering this way and that, stumbling on
	the uneven terrain.

	She stops, stands still, her hooded head swaying.

	She lurches out in an arbitrary direction.  Going downhill,
	she reels, staggers, and falls face-first into the snow,
	weeping.

				CARL
		Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Jesus!

	Grimsrud, still expressionless, breaks away from Carl's
	restraining hand to retrieve her.

	BRAINERD POLICE HEADQUARTERS

	We track behind Marge as she makes her way across the floor,
	greeting various officers.  She holds a small half-full
	paper sack.

	Beyond her we see a small glassed-in cublcle.  Norm sits at
	the desk inside with a box lunch spread out in front of him.
	There is lettering on the cubicle's glass door:  BRAINERD
	PD. CHIEF GUNDERSON.

	Marge enters and sits behind the desk, detaching her walkie-
	talkie from her utility belt to accomodate the seat.

				MARGE
		Hiya, hon.

	She slides the paper sack toward him.

				NORM
		Brought ya some lunch, Margie.
		What're those, night crawlers?

	He looks inside.

	The bottom of the sack is full of fat, crawling earthworms.

				MARGE
		Yah.

				NORM
		Thanks, hon.

				MARGE
		You bet.  Thanks for lunch.  What
		do we got here, Arbie's?

				NORM
		Uh-huh.

	She starts eating.

				MARGE
		...  How's the paintin' goin'?

				NORM
		Pretty good.  Found out the Hautmans
		are entering a painting this year.

				MARGE
		Aw, hon, you're better'n them.

				NORM
		They're real good.

				MARGE
		They're good, Norm, but you're
		better'n them.

				NORM
		Yah, ya think?

	He leans over and kisses her.

				MARGE
		Ah, ya got Arbie's all o'er me.

	Lou enters.

				LOU
		Hiya, Norm, how's the paintin'
		goin'?

				NORM
		Not too bad.  You know.

				MARGE
		How we doin' on that vehicle?

				LOU
		No motels registered any tan Ciera
		last night.  But the night before,
		two men checked into the Blue Ox
		registering a Ciera and leavin' the
		tag space blank.

				MARGE
		Geez, that's a good lead.  The
		Blue Ox, that's that trucker's
		joint out there on I-35?

				LOU
		Yah.  Owner was on the desk then,
		said these two guys had company.

				MARGE
		Oh, yah?

	EXT. STRIPPER CLUB

	Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot.  Snow
	drifts down.

	INT. STRIPPER CLUB

	Marge sits talking with two young women at one end of an
	elevated dance platform.  The club, not yet open for
	business, is deserted.

				MARGE
		Where you girls from?

				HOOKER ONE
		Chaska.

				HOOKER TWO
		LeSeure.  But I went to high school
		in White Bear Lake.

				MARGE
		Okay, I want you to tell me what
		these fellas looked like.

				HOOKER ONE
		Well, the little guy, he was
		kinda funny-looking.

				MARGE
		In what way?

				HOOKER ONE
		I dunno.  Just funny-looking.

				MARGE
		Can you be any more specific?

				HOOKER ONE
		I couldn't really say.  He wasn't
		circumcised.

				MARGE
		Was he funny-looking apart from
		that?

				HOOKER ONE
		Yah.

				MARGE
		So you were having sex with the
		little fella, then?

				HOOKER ONE
		Uh-huh.

				MARGE
		Is there anything else you can
		tell me about him?

				HOOKER ONE
		No.  Like I say, he was funny-looking.
		More'n most people even.

				MARGE
		And what about the other fella?

				HOOKER TWO
		He was a little older.  Looked like
		the Marlboro man.

				MARGE
		Yah?

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.  Maybe I'm sayin' that cause
		he smoked Marlboros.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				HOOKER TWO
		A subconscious-type thing.

				MARGE
		Yah, that can happen.

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.

				HOOKER ONE
		They said they were goin' to the
		Twin Cities?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah?

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.

				HOOKER ONE
		Yah.  Is that useful to ya?

				MARGE
		Oh, you bet, yah.

	EXT. LAKESIDE CABIN

	It is now dusk.  The brown Ciera with dealer plates still
	sits in the drive.

	INT. CABIN

	We track in on Jean Lundegaard, who sits tied in a chair
	with the black hood still over her head.  As we track in, we
	hear inarticulate cursing, intermittent banging and loud
	static.

	We track in on Gaear Grimsrud, who sits smoking a cigarette
	and expressionlessly gazing offscreen.

	We track in on Carl Showalter, who stands over an old black-
	and-white television.  It plays nothing but snow.  Carl is
	banging on it as he mutters:

				CARL
		...days ... be here for days with
		a - DAMMIT! - a goddamn mute ...
		nothin' to do ... and the fucking -
		DAMMIT!...

	Each "dammit" brings a pound of his fist on the TV.

				CARL
		...  TV doesn't even ... plug me
		in, man...  Gimmee a - DAMMIT! -
		signal...  Plug me into the
		ozone, baby...  Plug me into the
		ozone - FUCK!...

	With one last bang we cut:

	BACK TO THE TELEVISION SET

	In extreme close-up an insect is lugging a worm.

				TV VOICE-OVER
		The bark beetle carries the worm
		to the nest ... where it will feed
		its young for up to six weeks...

	A pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's
	house.

	Marge and Norm are watching television in bed.  From the TV
	we hear insects chirring.

	After a long beat, silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs,
	still looking at the set:

				MARGE
		...  Well, I'm turnin' in, Norm.

	Also looking at the TV:

				NORM
		...  Oh, yah?

	Marge rolls over and Norm continues to watch.

	We hold.

	BLACK

	Hold.

	A snowflake drops through the black.

	Another flake.

	It starts snowing.

	BRAINERD MAIN STREET

	The lone traffic light blinks slowly, steadily, red.  Snow
	sifts down.  There is no other movement.

	PAUL BUNYAN

	We are looking up at the bottom-lit statue.  Snow falls.

	HIGH SHOT OF MARGE'S HOUSE

	Snow drops away.

	HIGH SHOT IN MARGE'S BEDROOM

	The bedroom is dark.  Norm is snoring.

	The phone rings.

	Marge gropes in the dark.

				MARGE
		Hello?

		Yah, is this Marge?

				MARGE
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah, yah, course I remember.
		How are ya?  What time is it?

				MIKE
		Oh, geez.  It's quarter to eleven.
		I hope I dint wake you.

		that absent the reciept of those
		numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I
		will have to refer this matter to
		our legal department.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				VOICE
		My patience is at an end.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				VOICE
		Good day, sir.

				JERRY
		...  Yah.

	WIDE ON THE CUBICLE

	We are looking at Jerry's cubicle from across the showroom.
	Noise muted by distance, we watch Jerry slam down the
	reciever, rise to his feet, fling the phone to the floor,
	raise his desk blotter high over his head with pens and
	pencils rolling off it and slam it onto his desktop.

	He stands for a moment, hands on hips, glaring.

	He stoops and picks up the phone, places it back on the
	desktop, starts picking up the pens and pencils.

	TRACK

	On steam-table bins of food, each identified by a plaque:
	BEEF STROGANOFF, SWEDISH MEATBALLS, BROILED TORSK, CHICKEN
	FLORENTINE.

	A complementary track shows two rays being pushed along a
	buffet line, piled high with many foods.

	MARGE AND NORM AT A TABLE

	They sit next to each other at a long cafateria-style
	Formica table, silently eating.

	A hip with a hissing walkie-talkie enters frame.

				GARY
		Hiya, Norm.  How ya doin', Margie?
		How's the fricasse?

				MARGE
		Pretty darn good, ya want some?

				GARY
		No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought
		you were goin' fishin' up at Mile
		Lacs?

				NORM
		Yah, after lunch.

	He goes back to his food.

				MARGE
		Whatcha got there?

	Gary hands her a flimsy.  Marge takes it with one hand and
	looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food.

				GARY
		The numbers y'asked for, calls
		made from the lobby pay phone
		at the Blue Ox.  Two to Minneapolis
		that night.

				MARGE
		Mm.

				GARY
		First one's a trucking company,
		second one's a private residence.
		A Shep Proudfoot.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh...  A what?

				GARY
		Shep Proudfoot.  That's a name.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				GARY
		Yah.

				MARGE
		...  Yah, okay, I think I'll
		drive down there, then.

				GARY
		Oh, yah?  Twin Cities?

	Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at
	Marge with mild interest.  He stares for a beat as he
	finishes chewing, and them swallows and says:

				NORM
		...  Oh, yah?

	KITCHEN OF LUNDEGAARD HOUSE

	Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table.
	It is night.  The scene is harshly toplit by a hanging
	fixture.  On the table are the remains of coffee and a
	cinammon filbert ring.

				WADE
		Dammit!  I wanna be a part a
		this thing!

				JERRY
		No, Wade!  They were real clear!
		They said they'd call tomorrow,
		with instructions, and it's gonna
		be delivered by me alone!

				WADE
		It's my money, I'll deliver it
		- what do they care?

				STAN
		Wade's got a point there.  I'll
		handle the call if you want, Jerry.

				JERRY
		No, no.  See - they, no, see, they
		only deal with me.  Ya feel this,
		this nervousness on the phone there,
		they're very - these guys're
		dangerous -

				WADE
		All the more reason!  I don't want
		you - with all due respect, Jerry
		- I don't want you mucking this up.

				JERRY
		The heck d'ya mean?

				WADE
		They want my money, they can deal
		with me.  Otherwise I'm goin' to
		a professional.

	He points at a briefcase.

				WADE
		...  There's a million dollars
		here!

				JERRY
		No, see -

				WADE
		Look, Jerry, you're not sellin'
		me a damn car.  It's my show here.
		That's that.

				STAN
		It's the way we prefer to handle
		it, Jerry.

	THE DOWNTOWN RADISSON HOTEL

	Marge is at the reception desk.

				MARGE
		How ya doin'?

				CLERK
		Real good.  How're you today, ma'am?

				MARGE
		Real good.  I'm Mrs. Gunderson, I
		have a reservation.

	The clerk types into a computer console.

				CLERK
		You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

				MARGE
		Is there a phone down here, ya think?

	LOBBY CORNER

	Marge is on a public phone.

				MARGE
		...  Detective Sibert?  Yah, this
		is Marge Gunderson from up Brainerd,
		we spoke -  Yah.  Well, actually
		I'm in town here.  I had to do a
		few things in the Twin Cities, so
		I thought I'd check in with ya about
		that USIF search on Shep Proudfoot...
		Oh, yah?...  Well, maybe I'll go
		visit with him if I have the...  No,
		I can find that...  Well, thanks a
		bunch.  Say, d'ya happen to know a
		good place for lunch in the downtown
		area?...  Yah, the Radisson...  Oh,
		yah?  Is it reasonable?

	A GREEN FREEWAY SIGN

	Through a windshield we see a sign for the MINNEAPOLIS
	INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

	ROOFTOP PARKING LOT

	The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy S-curves around the
	few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot.

	It stops by one car and Carl emerges.  He quickly scans the
	lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car
	and starts unscrewing its license plate.

	EXIT BOOTH

	Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket.

				CARL
		Yeah, I decided not to park here.

	The attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket.

				ATTENDANT
		...  What do you mean, you decided
		not to park here?

				CARL
		Yeah, I just came in.  I decided
		not to park here.

	The attendant is still puzzled.

				ATTENDANT
		You, uh...  I'm sorry, sir, but -

				CARL
		I decided not to - I'm, uh, not
		taking the trip as it turns out.

				ATTENDANT
		I'm sorry, sir, we do have to
		charge you the four dollars.

				CARL
		I just pulled in here.  I just
		fucking pulled in here!

				ATTENDANT
		Well, see, there's a minimum charge
		of four dollars.  Long-term parking
		charges by the day.

	A car behind beeps.  Carl glances back, starts digging for
	money.

				CARL
		I guess you think, ya know, you're
		an authority figure.  With that
		stupid fucking uniform.  Huh, buddy?

	The attendant doesn't say anything.

				CARL
		...  King Clip-on Tie here.  Big
		fucking man.

	He is peeling off one dollar bills.

				CARL
		...  You know, these are the limits
		of your life, man.  Ruler of your
		little fucking gate here.  There's
		your four dollars.  You pathetic
		piece of shit.

	GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	Jerry is staring up, mouth agape, at the underside of a car
	on a hydraulic lift.  Bewildered, he looks about, then asks
	a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the
	shop.

				JERRY
		Where's Shep?

	The mechanic points.

				MECHANIC
		Talkin' to a cop.

	Jerry looks.

				JERRY
		...  Cop?

	Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor
	in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle.

				MECHANIC
		Said she was a policewoman.

	Marge and Shep silently talk.

	Jerry stares, swallows.

	INSIDE THE CUBICLE

				MARGE
		- Wednesday night?

	Shep is shaking his head.

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		Well, you do reside their at
		1425 Fremont Terrace?

				SHEP
		Yep.

				MARGE
		Anyone else residing there?

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
		came in past three in the morning.
		It's just hard for me to believe
		you can't remember anyone calling.

	Shep says nothing.

				MARGE
		...  Now, I know you've had some
		problems, struggling with the
		narcotics, some other entanglements,
		currently on parole -

				SHEP
		So?

				MARGE
		Well, associating with criminals,
		if you're the one they talked to,
		that right there would be a
		violation of your parole and would
		end with you back in Stillwater.

				SHEP
		Uh-huh.

				MARGE
		Now, I saw some rough stuff on
		your priors, but nothing in the
		nature of a homicide...

	Shep stares at her.

				MARGE
		...  I know you don't want to be
		an accessory to something like
		that.

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		So you think you might remember
		who those folks were who called
		ya?

	JERRY'S OFFICE

	Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk.  At a noise he
	looks up.

	Marge has stuck her head in the door.

				MARGE
		Mr. Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Huh?  Yah?

				MARGE
		I wonder if I could take just a
		minute of your time here -

				JERRY
		What...  What is it all about?

				MARGE
		Huh?  Do you mind if I sit down
		- I'm carrying quite a load here.

	Marge plops into the chair opposite him.

				MARGE
		...  You're the owner here, Mr.
		Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Naw, I...  Executive Sales Manager.

				MARGE
		Well, you can help me.  My name's
		Marge Gunderson -

				JERRY
		My father-in-law, he's the owner.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.  Well, I'm a police officer
		from up Brainerd investigating some
		malfeasance and I was just wondering
		if you've had any new vehicles stolen
		off the lot in the past couple of
		weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass
		Ciera?

	Jerry stares at her, his mouth open.

				MARGE
		...  Mr. Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		...  Brainerd?

				MARGE
		Yah.  Yah.  Home a Paul Bunyan and
		Babe the Blue Ox.

				JERRY
		...  Babe the Blue Ox?

				MARGE
		Yah, ya know we've got the big
		statue there.  So you haven't had
		any vehicles go missing, then?

				JERRY
		No.  No, ma'am.

				MARGE
		Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch.  I'll
		let you get back to your paperwork,
		then.

	As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on
	the desk in front of him.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, okay.

	He looks up at Marge's retreating back.  He looks back down
	at the papers.  He looks over at the phone.

	he picks up the phone and dials four digits.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, gimmee Shep...  The
		heck d'ya mean?...  Well, where'd
		he go?  It's only...  No, I don't
		need a mechanic - oh, geez - I
		gotta talk to a friend of his, so,
		uh ... have him, uh ... oh, geez...

	HOTEL BAR

	Marge enters.  She looks around the bar, a rather
	characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people.

				VOICE
		Marge?

	It is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising
	from a booth halfway back.  His features are broad,
	friendly, Asian-American.

				MARGE
		Mike!

	He approaches somewhat carefully, as if on his second drink.
	They hug and head back toward the booth.

				MIKE
		Geez!  You look great!

				MARGE
		Yah - easy there - you do too!
		I'm expecting, ya know.

				MIKE
		I see that!  That's great!

	A waitress meets them at the table.

				MIKE
		...  What can I get ya?

				MARGE
		Just a Diet Coke.

	Again she glances about.

				MARGE
		...  This is a nice place.

				MIKE
		Yah, ya know it's the Radisson,
		so it's pretty good.

				MARGE
		You're livin' in Edina, then?

				MIKE
		Oh, yah, couple years now.  It's
		actually Eden Prarie - that school
		district.  So Chief Gunderson, then!
		So ya went and married Norm Son-of-
		a-Gunderson!

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, a long time ago.

				MIKE
		Great.  What brings ya down - are
		ya down here on that homicide -
		if you're allowed, ya know, to
		discuss that?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva
		lot to discuss.  What about you,
		Mike?  Are you married - you have
		kids?

				MIKE
		Well, yah, I was married.  I was
		married to -  You mind if I sit
		over here?

	He is sliding out of his side of the booth and easing in
	next to Marge.

				MIKE
		...  I was married to Linda
		Cooksey -

				MARGE
		No, I -  Mike - wyncha sit over
		there, I'd prefer that.

				MIKE
		Huh?  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

				MARGE
		No, just so I can see ya, ya know.
		Don't have to turn my neck.

				MIKE
		Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't
		mean to -

				MARGE
		No, no, that's fine.

				MIKE
		Yah, sorry, so I was married to
		Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?
		She was a year behind us.

				MARGE
		I think I remember Linda, yah.
		She was - yah.  So things didn't
		work out, huh?

				MIKE
		And then I, and then I been workin'
		for Honeywell for a few years now.

				MARGE
		Well, they're a good outfit.

				MIKE
		Yah, if you're an engineer, yah,
		you could do a lot worse.  Of
		course, it's not, uh, it's
		nothin' like your achievement.

				MARGE
		It sounds like you're doin' really
		super.

				MIKE
		Yah, well, I, uh ... it's not that
		it didn't work out -  Linda passed
		away.  She, uh...

				MARGE
		I'm sorry.

				MIKE
		Yah, I, uh...  She had leukemia,
		you know...

				MARGE
		No, I didn't...

				MIKE
		It was a tough, uh ... it was a
		long -  She fought real hard,
		Marge...

				MARGE
		I'm sorry, Mike.

				MIKE
		Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what
		can I say?...

	He holds up his drink.

				MIKE
		...  Better times, huh?

	Marge clinks it.

				MARGE
		Better times.

				MIKE
		I was so...  I been so ... and
		then I saw you on TV, and I
		remembered, ya know...  I always
		liked you...

				MARGE
		Well, I always liked you, Mike.

				MIKE
		I always liked ya so much...

				MARGE
		It's okay, Mike -  Should we get
		together another time, ya think?

				MIKE
		No - I'm sorry!  It's just -  I
		been so lonely - then I saw you,
		and...

	He is weeping.

				MIKE
		...  I'm sorry...  I shouldn't a
		done this...  I thought we'd have
		a really terrific time, and now
		I've...

				MARGE
		It's okay...

				MIKE
		You were such a super lady ...
		and then I...  I been so lonely...

				MARGE
		It's okay, Mike...

	CARLTON CELEBRITY ROOM

	Carl Showalter is sitting at a small table with a tarty-
	looking blonde in a low-cut gown.  Each holds a drink.

				CARL
		Just in town on business.  Just
		in and out.  Ha ha!  A little of
		the old in-and-out!

				WOMAN
		Wuddya do?

	Carl looks around.

				CARL
		Have ya been to the Celebrity Room
		before?  With other, uh, clients?

				WOMAN
		I don't think so.  It's nice.

				CARL
		Yeah, well, it depends on the artist.
		You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no
		complaints.  Waiter!

	The reverse shows a disappearing waiter and the backs of
	many, many people sitting at tables between us and the very
	distant stage.  Jose Feliciano, very small, performs on a
	spotlit stool.  The acoustics are poor.

	Carl grimaces.

				CARL
		...  What is he, deaf?...  So,
		uh, how long have you been with
		the escort service?

				WOMAN
		I don't know.  Few munce.

				CARL
		Ya find the work interesting, do ya?

				WOMAN
		...  What're you talking about?

	A DIRTY BEDROOM

	Carl is humping the escort.

	We hear the door burst open.

	The escort is grabbed and flung out of bed.

				CARL
		Shep!  What the hell are you doing?
		I'm banging that girl!  Shep!  Jesus
		Ch -

	Shep slaps him hard, forehand, backhand.

				SHEP
		Fuck out of my house!

	He hauls him up -

				CARL
		Shep!  Don't you dare fucking hit
		me, man!  Don't you -

	- punches him and flings him away.

	Carl hits a sofa and we see his bare legs disappear as he
	flips back over it.

	Shep enters frame to circle the sofa and kick at Carl behind
	it.

				SHEP
		Fuck outta here.  Put me back in
		Stillwater.  Little fucking shit.

	There is a knock at the door.

				VOICE
		Hey!  Come on in there!

	Shep strides to the door, flings it open.

	A man in boxer shorts stands in the doorway.

				MAN
		C'mon, brother, it's late -  Unghh!

	Shep hits him twice, then grabs both of his ears and starts
	banging his head against the wall.

	The hooker runs by, clutching her clothes, and Shep kicks
	her in the ass as she passes.

	He spins and goes back into the apartment.

	Carl is hopping desperately into his pants.

				CARL
		Stay away from me, man!  Hey!
		Smoke a fuckin' peace pipe, man!
		Don't you dare fuckin' -  Unghh!

	After hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out
	of his dangling pants and strangles him with it.  Carl
	gurgles.  Shep knees Carl repeatedly, then dumps him onto
	the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the
	belt.

	CHAIN RESTAURANT PHONE BOOTH

	Carl listens to the phone ring at the other end.  His face
	is deeply bruised and cut.

	Finally, through the phone...

				VOICE
		...  Yah?

				CARL
		All right, Jerry, I'm through
		fucking around.  You got the
		fucking money?

	JERRY'S KITCHEN

	Jerry is at the kitchen phone.  Through the door to the
	dining room we see Wade picking up an extension.

				JERRY
		Yah, I got the money, but, uh -

				CARL
		Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.
		I want you with this money on the
		Dayton-Radisson parking ramp, top
		level, thirty minutes, and we'll
		wrap this up.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay, but, uh -

				CARL
		You're there in thirty minutes or
		I find you, Jerry, and I shoot
		you, and I shoot your fucking wife,
		and I shoot all your little fucking
		children, and I shoot 'em all in the
		back of their little fucking heads.
		Got it?

				JERRY
		...  Yah, well, you stay away from
		Scotty now -

				CARL
		GOT IT?

				JERRY
		Okay, real good, then.

	The line goes dead.

	A door slams offscreen.

	EXT. HOUSE

	Wade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the
	door and peels out.

	INT. CAR

	Wade's jaw works as he glares out at traffic.  He mumbles to
	himself as he drives.

				WADE
		Okay ... here's your damn money,
		now where's my daughter?...
		Goddamn punk ... where's my damn
		daughter...

	He pulls out a gun, cracks the barrel, peers in.

				WADE
		...  You little punk.

	JERRY'S HOUSE

	Jerry sits in the foyer, trying to pull on pair of galoshes.
	Scotty's voice comes from upstairs:

				VOICE
		...  Dad?

				JERRY
		It's okay, Scotty.

				VOICE
		Where're you going?

				JERRY
		Be back in a minute.  If Stan
		calls you, just tell him I went
		to Embers.  Oh, geez -

	Thunk! - his first boot goes on.

	RADISSON

	Marge sits on the bed in her hotel room, shoes off,
	massaging her feet.  The phone is pressed to her ear, and
	through it, we hear ringing.

				VOICE
		...  Hello?

				MARGE
		Norm?

	MILLE LACS LAKE

	It is late evening, blowing storm.  A leisurely pan across
	the bleak gray expanse finds a little hut in the middle of
	the frozen lake with a pickup truck parked next to it.

				MARGE'S VOICE
		They bitin'?

	INT. HUT

	Norm has a cellular phone to his ear.  His feet are
	stretched out to an electric heater.  The interior is bathed
	in soft orange light.

				NORM
		Yah, okay.  How's the hotel?

				MARGE
		Oh, pretty good.  They bitin'?

				NORM
		Yeah, couple a muskies.  No pike
		yet.  How d'you feel?

				MARGE
		Oh, fine.

				NORM
		Not on your feet too much?

				MARGE
		No, no.

				NORM
		You shouldn't be on your feet too
		much, you got weight you're not
		used too.  How's the food down
		there?

				MARGE
		Had dinner at a place called the
		King's Table.  Buffet style.  It
		was pretty darn good.

				NORM
		Was it reasonable?

				MARGE
		Yah, not too bad.  So it's nice
		up there?

				NORM
		Yah, it's good.  No pike yet, but
		it's good.

	DAYTON-RADISSON RAMP

	The top, open, level.  Snow blows.  A car sits idling.

	Another car pulls onto the roof.  It creeps over to the
	parked car and stops.  It continues to idle as its door
	opens and Wade steps out, carrying the briefcase.

	The door of the other car bangs open and Carl bounces out.

				CARL
		Who the fuck are you?  Who the
		fuck are you?

				WADE
		I got your goddamn money, you
		little punk.  Now where's my
		daughter?

				CARL
		I am through fucking around!  Drop
		that fucking briefcase!

				WADE
		Where's my daughter?

				CARL
		Fuck you, man!  Where's Jerry?  I
		gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -

				WADE
		Where's my damn daughter?  No
		Jean, no money!

				CARL
		Drop that fucking money!

				WADE
		No Jean, no money!

				CARL
		Is this a fucking joke here?

	He pulls out a gun and fires into Wade's gut.

				CARL
		...  Is this a fucking joke?

				WADE
		Unghh ... oh, geez...

	He is on the pavement, clutching at his gut.  Snow swirls.

				CARL
		You fucking imbeciles!

	He bends down next to Wade to pick up the briefcase.

				WADE
		Oh, for Christ ... oh, geez...

	Wade brings out his gun and fires at Carl's head, close by.

				CARL
		Oh!

	Carl stumbles and falls back, and then stands up again.  His
	jaw is gouting blood.

				CARL
		...  Owwmm...

	One hand pressed to his jaw, he fires down at Wade several
	times.  Blood streams through the hand pressed to his jaw.

				CARL
		...  Mmmmmphnck!  He fnkem shop me...

	He pockets the gun, picks up the briefcase one-handed,
	flings it into his car, gets in, peels out.

	DOWN RAMP

	Carl screams down the ramp.  He takes a corner at high speed
	and swerves, just missing Jerry in his Olds on his way to
	the top.

	INT. JERRY'S CAR

	Jerry recovers from the near miss and continues up.

				JERRY
		Oh, geez!

	EXIT BOOTH

	Carl squeals to a halt at the gate, still pressing his hand
	to his bleeding jaw.

				CARL
		Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!

				ATTENDANT
		May I have your ticket, please?

	RAMP ROOF

	Jerry pulls to a halt next to Wade's idling Cadillac.  He
	gets out and walks slowly to Wade's body, prostrate in the
	swirling snow.

				JERRY
		Oh!  Oh, geez!

	He bends down, picks Wade up by the armpits and drags him
	over to the back of the Cadillac.  He drops Wade's body,
	walks to the driver's side of the car, pulls the keys and
	walks back to pop the trunk.  He wrestles Wade's body into
	the trunk, slams it shut and walks back to the scene of the
	shooting.

	He kicks at the snow with his galoshed feet, trying to hide
	the fresh bloodstains.

	EXIT BOOTH

	Jerry approaches in the Cadillac.

	The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away.  The
	booth is empty.

	Jerry eases toward the street, looking over at the booth as
	he passes.

	Inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a
	prostrate body.

	EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE

	The car pulls into the driveway.

	FOYER

	Jerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his
	galoshes.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		...  Dad?

				JERRY
		Yah.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Stan Grossman called.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Twice.

				JERRY
		Okay.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		...  Is everything okay?

				JERRY
		Yah.

	Thoonk - the first boot comes off.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Are you calling Stan?

				JERRY
		Well...  I'm goin' ta bed now.

	CARL'S CAR

	Carl mumbles as he drives, underlit by the dim dash lights,
	one hand now holding a piece of rag to his shredded jaw.

				CARL
		...  Fnnkn ashlzh...  Fnk...

	ROAD

	Carl's car roars into frame, violently swirling the snow.
	Its red tail lights fishtail away.

	FADE OUT

	HOLD IN BLACK

	HARD CUT TO:  BRIGHT - LOOKING THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

	It is a starky sunny day.  We are cruising down a street of
	humble lookalike houses.

	We pan right as we draw toward one house in particular.  In
	its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow.  He
	notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave.

	The driver is Gary, the Brainderd police officer.  He gives
	a finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over.

	OUTSIDE

	Gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel
	in the snow.

				MAN
		How ya doin'?

				GARY
		Mr. Mohra?

				MAN
		Yah.

				GARY
		Officer Olson.

				MAN
		Yah, right-o.

	The two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and
	without standing particularly close.  They stand stiffly,
	arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their
	parka hoods.  Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head
	drawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face
	from protruding into the cold.

				MAN
		...  So, I'm tendin' bar there at
		Ecklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday
		and this little guy's drinkin'
		and he says, 'So where can a guy
		find some action - I'm goin' crazy
		down there at the lake.'  And I
		says, 'What kinda action?' and he
		says, 'Woman action, what do I
		look like,'  And I says 'Well,
		what do I look like, I don't
		arrange that kinda thing,' and he
		says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there
		at the lake' and I says, 'Well,
		this ain't that kinda place.'

				GARY
		Uh-huh.

				MAN
		So he says, 'So I get it, so you
		think I'm some kinda jerk for
		askin',' only he doesn't use the
		word jerk.

				GARY
		I unnerstand.

				MAN
		And then he calls me a jerk and
		says the last guy who thought he
		was a jerk was dead now.  So I
		don't say nothin' and he says, 'What
		do ya think about that?'  So I
		says, 'Well, that don't sound like
		too good a deal for him then.'

				GARY
		Ya got that right.

				MAN
		And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead
		and I don't mean a old age.'  And
		then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin'
		crazy out there at the lake.'

				GARY
		White Bear Lake?

				MAN
		Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's
		closer ta Moose Lake, so I made
		that assumption.

				GARY
		Oh sure.

				MAN
		So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I
		don't think a whole great deal of
		it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the
		homicides out here and she thought
		I should call it in, so I called
		it in.  End a story.

				GARY
		What'd this guy look like anyways?

				MAN
		Oh, he was a little guy, kinda
		funny-lookin'.

				GARY
		Uh-huh - in what way?

				MAN
		Just a general way.

				GARY
		Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr.
		Mohra.  You're right, it's probably
		nothin', but thanks for callin'
		her in.

				MAN
		Oh sure.  They say she's gonna
		turn cold tomorrow.

				GARY
		Yah, got a front movin' in.

				MAN
		Ya got that right.

	CLOSE ON CARL SHOWALTER

	In his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to
	his mangled jaw.  He is staring down at something in the
	front seat next to him.

	His other hand holds open the briefcase.  It has money
	inside - a lot of money.

	Carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and
	looks at it.

				CARL
		...  Mmmnphh.

	He paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling
	for the amount.

				CARL
		...  Jeshush Shrist...  Jeshush
		fuchem Shrist!

	Excited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto
	the back seat.

	He starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer
	pressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to
	his skin by clotted blood.

	He pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow
	again.

	He carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it
	remains adhering to his jaw.

	EXT. CAR

	It is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road.  THe
	door opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase.

	He slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the
	embankment to a barbed-wire fence.  He kneels at one of the
	fence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare
	hands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up.

	He stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his
	red, frozen hands.

	He looks to the right.

	A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
	against unblemished white.

	He looks to the left.

	A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
	against unblemished white.

	He looks at the fence post in front of him.

				CARL
		Mmmphh...

	He looks about the snowy vastness for a marker.  Finding
	none, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to
	scar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up
	against the post.

	He bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it
	against his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car.

	HOTEL ROOM

	Marge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed.
	She is ready to leave, already wearing her parka, but is on
	the phone.

				MARGE
		No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back
		up to Brainerd.

				VOICE
		Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.

				MARGE
		Mm.  But ya think he's all right?
		I saw him last night and he's -

				VOICE
		What'd he say?

				MARGE
		Well, it was nothin' specific
		he said, it just seemd like it
		all hit him really hard, his
		wife dyin' -

				VOICE
		His wife?

				MARGE
		Linda.

				VOICE
		No.

				MARGE
		Linda Cooksey?

				VOICE
		No.  No.  No.  They weren't -
		he, uh, he was bothering Linda
		for about, oh, for a good year.
		Really pestering her, wouldn't
		leave her alone.

				MARGE
		So ... they didn't...

				VOICE
		No.  No.  They never married.
		Mike's had psychiatric problems.

				MARGE
		Oh.  Oh, my.

				VOICE
		Yah, he - he's been struggling.
		He's living with his parents now.

				MARGE
		Oh.  Geez.

				VOICE
		Yah, Linda's fine.  You should
		call her.

				MARGE
		Geez.  Well - geez.  That's a
		suprise.

	MARGE'S CAR

	Marge drives, gazing out at the road.

	MARGE AT A DRIVE-THROUGH

	She leans out of her open window and yells at the order
	panel:

				MARGE
		Hello?

	MARGE AT THE GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich.

	JERRY LUNDEGAARD'S OFFICE

	Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers
	onto a form.  Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper
	and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically
	checks.  The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible
	entries.

	Jerry hums nervously.

	Glass rattles as someone taps at his door.

	Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit
	with worry.

	Marge sticks her head in the door.

				MARGE
		Mr. Lundegaard?  Sorry to bother
		you again.  Can I come in?

	She starts to enter.

				JERRY
		Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda
		busy -

				MARGE
		I unnerstand.  I'll keep it real
		short, then.  I'm on my way out
		of town, but I was just -  Do you
		mind if I sit down?  I'm carrying
		a bit of a load here.

				JERRY
		No, I -

	But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a
	sigh of relieved weight.

				MARGE
		Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you
		about yesterday.  I was just
		wondering -

				JERRY
		Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had
		any vehicles go missing.

				MARGE
		Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean,
		how do you know?  Because, see,
		the crime I'm investigating, the
		perpetrators were driving a car
		with dealer plates.  And they
		called someone who works here, so
		it'd be quite a coincidence if
		they weren't, ya know, connected.

				JERRY
		Yah, I see.

				MARGE
		So how do you - have you done any
		kind of inventory recently?

				JERRY
		The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

				MARGE
		but do you know that for sure
		without -

				JERRY
		Well, I would know.  I'm the
		Executive Sales Manager.

				MARGE
		Yah, but -

				JERRY
		We run a pretty tight ship here.

				MARGE
		I know, but - well, how do you
		establish that, sir?  Are the
		cars, uh, counted daily or what
		kind of -

				JERRY
		Ma'am, I answered your question.

	There is a silent beat.

				MARGE
		...  I'm sorry, sir?

				JERRY
		Ma'am, I answered your question.
		I answered the darn -  I'm
		cooperating here, and I...

				MARGE
		Sir, you have no call to get
		snippy with me.  I'm just doin'
		my job here.

				JERRY
		I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here.
		I'm cooperating...  There's no, uh
		- we're doin' all we can...

	He trails off into silence.

				MARGE
		Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

	Jerry stares at her.

				MARGE
		...  Mr. Lundegaard?

	Jerry explodes:

				JERRY
		Well, heck, if you wanna, if you
		wanna play games here!  I'm
		workin' with ya on this thing, but
		I...

	He is getting angrily off his feet.

				JERRY
		Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!

				MARGE
		Sir?  Right now?

				JERRY
		Sure right now!  You're darned
		tootin'!

	He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door
	and grabbing a pair of galoshes.

				JERRY
		...  If it's so damned imporant
		to ya!

				MARGE
		I'm sorry, sir, I -

	Jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes
	pinched in his hand.

				JERRY
		Aw, what the Christ!

	He stamps out the door.

	Marge stares.

	After a long moment her stare breaks.  She glances idly
	around the office.

	There is a framed picture facing away from her on the
	desktop.  She turns it to face her.  It is Scotty, holding
	an accordion.  There is another picture of Jean.

	Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the
	ceiling.

	She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her.

	She fiddles idly with a pencil.  She pulls a clipboard
	toward her.  It holds a form from the General Motors Finance
	Corporation.

	She looks idly around.  Her look abruptly locks.

				MARGE
		...  Oh, for Pete's sake.

	Jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the
	building.

	Marge's voice is flat with dismay:

				MARGE
		...  Oh, for Pete's sake...

	She grabs the phone and punches in a number.

				MARGE
		...  For Pete's s- he's fleein' the
		interview.  He's feelin' the
		interview...

	Jerry makes a left turn into traffic.

				MARGE
		...  Detective Sibert, please...

	POLICE OFFICER

	We are looking across a steam table at a man in blue.  He
	moves slowly to the right, pushing his tray along a
	cafeteria line.  Behind him, in the depth of the room, is an
	eating area of long Formica tables at which sit a mix of
	uniformed and civilian-clothed police and staff.

	We are listening to an offscreen woman's voice.

				WOMAN
		Well, so far we're just saying he's
		wanted for questioning in connection
		with a triple homicide.  Nobody at
		the dealship there's been much help
		guessing where he might go...

	The woman is entering frame sliding a tray.  Marge enters
	behind her, sliding her own.  We move laterally with them as
	they slowly make their way along the line.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				WOMAN
		We called his house; his little
		boy said he hadn't been there.

				MARGE
		And his wife?

				WOMAN
		She's visiting relatives in Florida.
		Now his boss, this guy Gustafson,
		he's also disappeared.  Nobody at
		his office knows where he is.

				MARGE
		Geez.  Looks like this thing goes
		higher than we thought.  You call
		his home?

				WOMAN
		His wife's in the hospital, has
		been for a couple months.  The big C.

				MARGE
		Oh, my.

				WOMAN
		And this Shep Proudfoot character,
		he's a little darling.  He's now
		wanted for assault and parole
		violation.  He clobbered a neighbor
		of his last night and another
		person who could be one of your perps,
		and he's at large.

				MARGE
		Boy, this thing is really ... geez.

				WOMAN
		Well, they're all out on the wire.
		Well, you know...

				MARGE
		Yah.  Well, I just can't thank you
		enough, Detective Sibert, this
		cooperation has been outstanding.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Ah, well, we haven't had to run
		around like you.  When're you due?

				MARGE
		End a April.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Any others?

				MARGE
		This'll be our first.  We've been
		waiting a long time.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		That's wonderful.  Mm-mm.  It'll
		change your life, a course.

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, I know that!

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		They can really take over, that's
		for sure.

				MARGE
		You have children?

	Detective Sibert pulls an accordion of plastic picture
	sleeves from her purse to show Marge.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		I thought you'd never ask.  The
		older one is Janet, she's nine, and
		the younger one is Morgan.

				MARGE
		Oh, now he's adorable.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		He's three now.  Course, not in that
		picture.

				MARGE
		Oh, he's adorable.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Yah, he -

				MARGE
		Where'd you get him that parka?

	They have reached the end of the cafeteria line.  With a nod
	to the cashier, Detective Sibert indicates hers and Marge's
	trays.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Both of these.

				MARGE
		Oh, no, I can't let you do that.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Oh, don't be silly.

				MARGE
		Well, okay - thank you, Detective.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Oh, don't be silly.

	GAEAR GRIMSRUD

	He sits eating a Swanson's TV dinner from a TV tray he has
	set up in front of an easy chair.

	He watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it
	might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and
	diffused by snow.  The audio crackles with interference.
	Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds
	Grimsrud's complete attention.

	At the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up.

	Carl enters, his face suppurating and raw.

	He reacts to Grimsrud's wordless look with a grotesque
	laugh.

				CARL
		You should she zhe uzher guy!

	He glances around.

				CARL
		...  The fuck happen a her?

	Jean sits slumped in a straight-backed chair facing the
	wall.  Her hooded head, resting on her chin, is motionless.
	There is blood on the facing wall.

				GRIMSRUD
		She started shrieking, you know.

				CARL
		Jezhush.

	He shakes his head.

				CARL
		...  Well, I gotta muddy.

	He is plunking down eight bank-wrapped bundles on the table.

				CARL
		...  All of it.  All eighty gran.
		Forty for you...

	He makes one pile, pockets the rest.

				CARL
		...  Forty for me.  Sho thishuzh
		it.  Adiosh.

	He slaps keys down on the table.

				CARL
		...  You c'n'ave my truck.  I'm
		takin' a Shiera.

				GRIMSRUD
		We split that.

	Carl looks at him.

				CARL
		HOW THE FUCK DO WE SHPLITTA FUCKIN'
		CAR?  Ya dummy!  Widda fuckin'
		chainshaw?

	Grimsrud looks sourly up.  There is a beat.  Finally:

				GRIMSRUD
		One of us pays the other for half.

				CARL
		HOLD ON!  NO FUCKIN' WAY!  YOU
		FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH?  I GOT FUCKIN'
		SHOT INNA FAISH!  I WENT'N GOTTA
		FUCKIN' MONEY!  I GET SHOT FUCKIN'
		PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR
		THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH!  I'M
		TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR!  THAT
		FUCKERZH MINE!

	Carl waits for an argument, but only gets the steady sour
	look.

	Carl pulls out a gun.

				CARL
		...  YOU FUCKIN' ASH-HOLE!  I
		LISHEN A YOUR BULLSHIT FOR A WHOLE
		FUCKIN' WEEK!

	A beat.  Carl returns Grimsrud's stare.

				CARL
		...  Are we shquare?

	Grimsrud says nothing.

				CARL
		...  ARE WE SHQUARE?

	A beat.

	Disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door.

				CARL
		...  Fuckin' ash-hole.  And if
		you shee your friend Shep Proudpfut,
		tell him I'm gonna NAIL hizh
		fuckin' ash.

	OUTSIDE

	We are pulling Carl as he walks toward the car.  Behind him
	we see the cabin door opening.  Carl turns, reacting to the
	sound.

	Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's
	cap, but no overcoat.  He is holding an ax.

	Carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun.

	Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the ax in Carl's neck.

	MARGE

	In her cruiser, on her two-way.  Through it we hear Lou's
	voice, heavily filtered:

				VOICE
		His wife.  This guy says she was
		kidnapped last Wednesday.

				MARGE
		The day of our homicides.

				VOICE
		Yah.

	Marge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through
	the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs
	down to a large frozen lake.

				MARGE
		And this guy is...

				VOICE
		Lundegaard's father-in-law's
		accountant.

				MARGE
		Gustafson's accountant.

				VOICE
		Yah.

				MARGE
		But we still haven't found Gustafson.

				VOICE
			(crackle)
		-  looking.

				MARGE
		Sorry - didn't copy.

				VOICE
		Still missing.  We're looking.

				MARGE
		Copy.  And Lundegaard too.

				VOICE
		Yah.  Where are ya, Margie?

	We hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as
	of a chainsaw or lawnmower.

				MARGE
		Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving
		around Moose Lake.

				VOICE
		Oh.  Gary's loudmouth.

				MARGE
		Yah, the loudmouth.  So the whole
		state has it, Lundegaard and
		Gustafson?

				VOICE
		Yah, it's over the wire, it's
		everywhere, they'll find 'em.

				MARGE
		Copy.

				VOICE
		We've got a -

				MARGE
		There's the car!  There's the car!

	We are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down
	to a cabin.  Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera.

				VOICE
		Whose car?

				MARGE
		My car!  My car!  Tan Ciera!

				VOICE
		Don't go in!  Wait for back-up!

	Marge is straining to look.  The power-tool noise is louder
	here but still muffled, its source not yet visible.

				VOICE
		...  Chief Gunderson?

				MARGE
		Copy.  Yah, send me back-up!

				VOICE
		Yes, ma'am.  Are we the closest PD?

				MARGE
		Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich
		and he takes February off to go to
		Boundary Waters.

	ROAD EXTERIOR

	Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin.
	She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-
	lined hood.

	For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of
	the power tool.  Then, with one curved arm half pressing
	against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly
	steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the
	trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the
	grinding noise.

	She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her
	downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the
	next.

	The roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree,
	her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squints
	down toward the cabin's back lot.

	A tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted
	jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a
	large power tool which his body blocks from view.

	Marge advances.

	The man is forcing downward something which engages the
	roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.

	The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the
	cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams
	as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a
	shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.

	The roar is very loud.

	Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.

	Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we
	can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.

	Marge's eyes shift.

	A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.

	Grimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends
	down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.
	He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.

	Marge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward
	Grimsrud, who is still turned away.

	Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

	Marge closes in, grimacing.

	Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log
	that pushes down into the machine.

	The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of
	Carl Showalter's body.

	Marge has drawn to within twenty yards.  When she bellows it
	sounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the
	roar of the power tool.

				MARGE
		Stop!  Police!  Turn around and
		hands up!

	Startled, Grimsrud scowls.  He turns to face her.

	He stares.

	Marge bellows again:

				MARGE
		...  Hands up!

	Conscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her
	shoulder the armpatch insignia.

				MARGE
		...  Police!

	Grimsrud stares.

	With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at
	Marge and then starts running away.

	Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.

	No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands
	in the snow several feet short of her.

	Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep
	snow.

	Behind him:

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires in the air.

	She lowers the gun and carefully sighs.

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires.

	Grimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss.

	Marge sights again.

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires again.

	Grimsrud pitches forward.  He mutters in Swedish as he
	reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.

	Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand
	reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.

	It comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with
	a snap of the wrist.

				MARGE
		...  All right, buddy.  On your
		belly and your hands clasped
		behind you.

	THE CRUISER

	Marge drives.  Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed
	behind him.

	For a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and
	the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge
	grimly shakes her head.

				MARGE
		...  So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
		in there?

	She glances up in the rear-view mirror.

	Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the
	road.

	Marge shakes her head.

	At length:

				MARGE
		...  I guess that was your
		accomplice in the wood chipper.

	Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is
	motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.

				MARGE
		...  And those three people in
		Brainerd.

	No response.

	Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.

				MARGE
		...  And for what?  For a little
		bit of money.

	We hear distant sirens.

				MARGE
		...  There's more to life than money,
		you know.

	She glances up in the rear-view mirror.

				MARGE
		...  Don't you know that?...  And
		here ya are, and it's a beautiful
		day...

	Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out.

	The sirens are getting louder.  Marge pulls over.

				MARGE
		...  Well...

	She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling
	WHOOPS on her siren.

	She turns on her flashers.

	She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.

	She stares forward, shakes her head.  We hear the dull click
	of her flashers.

				MARGE
		...  I just don't unnerstand it.

	Outside it is snowing.  The sky, the earth, the road - all
	white.

	A squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white.
	It approaches in slow motion.

	An ambulance punches through after it.

	Another squad car.

							 FADE OUT:


	FADE IN:

	HIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL

	It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain.
	One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling
	police cruiser.

	MOTEL ROOM DOORWAY

	We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen
	who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting
	lightly on their holstered sidearms.  One of them raps at
	the door.

				COP ONE
		Mr. Anderson...

	A title fades in:  OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA

	After a pause, muffled through the door:

				VOICE
		...  Who?...

				COP ONE
		Mr. Anderson, is this your burgundy
		88 out here?

				VOICE
		...  Just a sec.

				COP ONE
		Could you open the door, please?

				VOICE
		...  Yah.  Yah, just a sec.

	We hear a clatter from inside.

				VOICE
		...  Just a sec...

	One of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone
	whose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys.
	This man turns a key in the door and then stands away.

	The two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel
	room.

	The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two
	men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns.

	The room is empty.

	Cop one indicates the open bathroom door.

				COP ONE
		Dale!

	The two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the
	ready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace.

	A man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window.

	The policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and
	drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room.

	His flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short,
	piercing screams.

	The cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing
	continues.  The policemen struggle to restrain him.

				COP ONE
		Call an ambulance!

				COP TWO
		You got him okay?

	Cop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts
	into uncontrolled sobbing.

				COP ONE
		Yah, yah, call an ambulance.

	Jerry sobs and screams.

	A BEDROOM

	We are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.

	After a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and
	climbs into bed, with some effort.

				MARGE
		Oooph!

	Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television.

	At length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV.

				NORM
		They announced it.

	Marge looks at him.

				MARGE
		They announced it?

				NORM
		Yah.

	Marge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay
	fixed on the television.

				MARGE
		...  So?

				NORM
		Three-cent stamp.

				MARGE
		Your mallard?

				NORM
		Yah.

				MARGE
		Norm, that's terrific!

	Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure.

				NORM
		It's just the three cent.

				MARGE
		It's terrific!

				NORM
		Hautman's blue-winged teal got the
		twenty-nine cent.  People don't
		much use the three-cent.

				MARGE
		Oh, for Pete's - a course they do!
		Every time they raise the darned
		postage, people need the little
		stamps!

				NORM
		Yah.

				MARGE
		When they're stuck with a bunch a
		the old ones!

				NORM
		Yah, I guess.

				MARGE
		That's terrific.

	Her eyes go back to the TV.

				MARGE
		...  I'm so proud a you, Norm.

	Norm murmurs:

				NORM
		I love you, Margie.

				MARGE
		I love you, Norm.

	Both of them are watching the TV as Norm reaches out to rest
	a hand on top of her stomach.

				NORM
		...  Two more months.

	Marge absently rests her own hand on top of his.

				MARGE
		Two more months.

	Hold; fade out.
FARGO
                              a screenplay by
                                Ethan Coen
                                    and
                                 Joel Coen

	The following text fades in over black:

	This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place
	in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names
	have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been
	told exactly as it occured.

	FLARE TO WHITE

	FADE IN FROM WHITE

	Slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white
	particles wave over a white background.  A snowfall.

	A car bursts through the curtain of snow.

	The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car,
	a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales
	sticker showing in its rear window.

	As the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft,
	the title of the film fades in.

				FARGO

	Green highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD,
	MINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities
	diverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another
	just after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412.

	The car pulls into a Rodeway Inn.

	HOTEL LOBBY

	A man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch,
	goes to the reception desk.  The clerk is an older woman.

				CLERK
		And how are you today, sir?

				MAN
		Real good now.  I'm checking in
		- Mr. Anderson.

	The man prints "Jerry Lundega" onto a registration card,
	then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print
	"Anderson."

	As she types into a computer:

				CLERK
		Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're
		still planning on staying with
		us just the night, then?

				ANDERSON
		You bet.

	HOTEL ROOM

	The man turns on the TV, which shows the local evening news.

				NEWS ANCHOR
		- whether they will go to summer
		camp at all.  Katie Jensen has
		more.

				KATIE
		It was supposed to be a project
		funded by the city council;  it
		was supposed to benefit those
		Fargo-Moorehead children who
		would otherwise not be able to
		afford to attend a lakeshore
		summer camp.  But nobody consulted
		city controller Stu Jacobson...

	CHAIN RESTAURANT

	Anderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner.  Muzak
	plays.  A middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of
	regular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other.

				WAITRESS
		Can I warm that up for ya there?

				ANDERSON
		You bet.

	The man looks at his watch.

	THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

	We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story
	brick building.  Broken neon at the top of the building
	identifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern.  A troll, also in
	neon, holds a champagne glass aloft.

	INSIDE

	The bar is downscale even for this town.  Country music
	plays on the jukebox.

	Two men are seated in a booth at the back.  One is short,
	slight, youngish.  The other man is somewhat older, and
	dour.  The table in front of them is littered with empty
	long-neck beer bottles.  The ashtray is full.

	Anderson approaches.

				ANDERSON
		I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -

				YOUNGER MAN
		You're Jerry Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -

				YOUNGER MAN
		Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
		What gives, man?

				JERRY
		Shep said 8:30.

				YOUNGER MAN
		We been sitting here an hour.
		I've peed three times already.

				JERRY
		I'm sure sorry.  I - Shep told
		me 8:30.  It was a mix-up, I
		guess.

				YOUNGER MAN
		Ya got the car?

				JERRY
		Yah, you bet.  It's in the lot
		there.  Brand-new burnt umber
		Ciera.

				YOUNGER MAN
		Yeah, okay.  Well, siddown then.
		I'm Carl Showalter and this is
		my associate Gaear Grimsrud.

				JERRY
		Yah, how ya doin'.  So, uh, we
		all set on this thing, then?

				YOUNGER MAN
		Sure, Jerry, we're all set.  Why
		wouldn't we be?

				JERRY
		Yah, no, I'm sure you are.  Shep
		vouched for you and all.  I got
		every confidence in you fellas.

	They stare at him.  An awkward beat.

				JERRY
		...  So I guess that's it, then.
		Here's the keys -

				CARL
		No, that's not it, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Huh?

				CARL
		The new vehicle, plus forty
		thousand dollars.

				JERRY
		Yah, but the deal was, the car
		first, see, then the forty
		thousand, like as if it was the
		ransom.  I thought Shep told you -

				CARL
		Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Well, okay, it's -

				CARL
		Except that you were gonna be
		here at 7:30.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

				CARL
		Yeah, you already said that.

				JERRY
		Yah.  But it's not a whole pay-
		in-advance deal.  I give you a
		brand-new vehicle in advance and -

				CARL
		I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Okay.

				CARL
		I'm not gonna sit here and debate.
		I will say this though:  what Shep
		told us didn't make a whole lot
		of sense.

				JERRY
		Oh, no, it's real sound.  It's
		all worked out.

				CARL
		You want your own wife kidnapped?

				JERRY
		Yah.

	Carl Stares.  Jerry looks blankly back.

				CARL
		...  You - my point is, you pay
		the ransom - what eighty thousand
		bucks? -  I mean, you give us
		half the ransom, forty thousand,
		you keep half.  It's like robbing
		Peter to play Paul, it doesn't
		make any -

				JERRY
		Okay, it's - see, it's not me
		payin' the ransom.  The thing is,
		my wife, she's wealthy - her dad,
		he's real well off.  Now, I'm in
		a bit of trouble -

				CARL
		What kind of trouble are you in,
		Jerry?

				JERRY
		Well, that's, that's, I'm not go
		inta, inta - see, I just need
		money.  Now, her dad's real
		wealthy -

				CARL
		So why don't you just ask him
		for the money?

	Grimsrud, the dour man who has not yet spoken, now softly
	puts in with a Swedish-accented voice:

				GRIMSRUD
		Or your fucking wife, you know.

				CARL
		Or your fucking wife, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Well, it's all just part of this -
		they don't know I need it, see.
		Okay, so there's that.  And even
		if they did, I wouldn't get it.
		So there's that on top, then.  See,
		these're personal matters.

				CARL
		Personal matters.

				JERRY
		Yah.  Personal matters that
		needn't, uh -

				CARL
		Okay, Jerry.  You're tasking us
		to perform this mission, but you,
		you won't, uh, you won't - aw,
		fuck it, let's take a look at
		that Ciera.

	MINNEAPOLIS SUBURBAN HOUSE

	Jerry enters through the kitchen door, in a parka and a red
	plaid Elmer Fudd hat.  He stamps snow off his feet.  He is
	carrying a bag of groceries which he deposits on the kitchen
	counter.

				JERRY
		Hon?  Got the growshries.

				VOICE
		Thank you, hon.  How's Fargo?

				JERRY
		Yah, real good.

				VOICE
		Dad's here.

	DEN

	Jerry enters, pulling off his plaid cap.

				JERRY
		How ya doin', Wade?

	Wade Gustafson is mid-sixtyish, vigorous, with a full head
	of gray hair.  His eyes remain fixed on the TV.

				WADE
		Yah, pretty good.

				JERRY
		Whatcha watchin' there?

				WADE
		Norstars.

				JERRY
		...  Who they playin'?

				WADE
		OOOoooh!

	His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.

	KITCHEN

	Jerry walks back in, taking off his coat.  His wife is
	putting on an apron.  Jerry nods toward the living room.

				JERRY
		Is he stayin' for supper, then?

				WIFE
		Yah, I think so...  Dad, are you
		stayin' for supper?

				WADE
			(off)
		Yah.

	DINING ROOM

	Jerry, his wife, Wade and Scotty, twelve years old, sit
	eating.

				SCOTTY
		May I be excused?

				JERRY
		Sure, ya done there?

				SCOTTY
		Uh-huh.  Goin' out.

				WIFE
		Where are you going?

				SCOTTY
		Just out.  Just McDonald's.

				JERRY
		Back at 9:30.

				SCOTTY
		Okay.

				WADE
		He just ate.  And he didn't finish.
		He's going to McDonald's instead
		of finishing here?

				WIFE
		He sees his friends there.  It's
		okay.

				WADE
		It's okay?  McDonald's?  What do
		you think they do there?  They
		don't drink milkshakes, I assure
		you!

				WIFE
		It's okay, Dad.

				JERRY
		Wade, have ya had a chance to
		think about, uh, that deal I was
		talkin' about, those forty acres
		there on Wayzata?

				WADE
		You told me about it.

				JERRY
		Yah, you said you'd have a think
		about it.  I understand it's a
		lot of money -

				WADE
		A heck of a lot.  What'd you
		say you were gonna put there?

				JERRY
		A lot.  It's a limited -

				WADE
		I know it's a lot.

				JERRY
		I mean a parking lot.

				WADE
		Yah, well, seven hundred and
		fifty thousand dollars is a lot
		- ha ha ha!

				JERRY
		Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -

				WADE
		I thought you were gonna show
		it to Stan Grossman.  He passes
		on this stuff before it gets
		kicked up to me.

				JERRY
		Well, you know Stan'll say no
		dice.  That's why you pay him.
		I'm asking you here, Wade.  This
		could work out real good for me
		and Jean and Scotty -

				WADE
		Jean and Scotty never have to
		worry.

	WHITE

	A black like curls through the white.  Twisting perspective
	shows that it is an aerial shot of a two-lane highway,
	bordered by snowfields.  The highway carries one moving car.

	INT. CAR

	Carl Showalter is driving.  Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly
	out.

	After a long beat:

				GRIMSRUD
		Where is Pancakes Hause?

				CARL
		What?

				GRIMSRUD
		We stop at Pancakes Hause.

				CARL
		What're you, nuts?  We had
		pancakes for breakfast.  I gotta
		go somewhere I can get a shot
		and a beer - and a steak maybe.
		Not more fuckin' pancakes.  Come
		on.

	Grimsrud gives him a sour look.

				CARL
		...  Come on, man.  Okay, here's
		an idea.  We'll stop outside of
		Brainerd.  I know a place there
		we can get laid.  Wuddya think?

				GRIMSRUD
		I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.

				CARL
		Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin',
		we'll stop for pancakes, then
		we'll get laid.  Wuddya think?

	GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	Jerry is sitting in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just
	off the showroom floor.  On the other side of his desk sit
	an irate customer and his wife.

				CUSTOMER
		We sat here right in this room and
		went over this and over this!

				JERRY
		Yah, but that TruCoat -

				CUSTOMER
		I sat right here and said I didn't
		want no TruCoat!

				JERRY
		Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat,
		you don't get it and you get
		oxidization problems.  It'll cost
		you a heck of lot more'n five
		hunnert -

				CUSTOMER
		You're sittin' here, you're talkin'
		in circles!  You're talkin' like
		we didn't go over this already!

				JERRY
		Yah, but this TruCoat -

				CUSTOMER
		We had us a deal here for nine-
		teen-five.  You sat there and
		darned if you didn't tell me
		you'd get this car, these options,
		WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nine-
		teen-five!

				JERRY
		Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -

				CUSTOMER
		You called me twenty minutes ago
		and said you had it!  Ready to
		make delivery, ya says!  Come on
		down and get it!  And here ya are
		and you're wastin' my time and
		you're wastin' my wife's time and
		I'm payin' nineteen-five for this
		vehicle here!

				JERRY
		Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...

	He rises, and, as he leaves:

				JERRY
		...  See, they install that TruCoat
		at the factory, there's nothin' we
		can do, but I'll talk to my boss.

	The couple watch him go to a nearby cubicle.

				CUSTOMER
		These guys here - these guys!
		It's always the same!  It's always
		more!  He's a liar!

				WIFE
		Please, dear.

				CUSTOMER
		We went over this and over this -

	NEARBY CUBICLE

	Jerry sits perched on the desk of another salesman who is
	eating lunch as he watches a hockey game on a small portable
	TV.

				JERRY
		So you're goin' to the Gophers
		on Sunday?

				SALESMAN
		You bet.

				JERRY
		You wouldn't have an extra ticket
		there?

				SALESMAN
		They're playin' the Buckeyes!

				JERRY
		Yah.

				SALESMAN
		Ya kiddin'!

	JERRY'S CUBICLE

	Jerry re-enters.

				JERRY
		Well, he never done this before,
		but seein' as it's special
		circumstances and all, he says I
		can knock one hunnert off that
		TruCoat.

				CUSTOMER
		One hundred!  You lied to me, Mr.
		Lundegaard.  You're a bald-faced
		liar!

	Jerry sits staring at his lap.

				CUSTOMER
		...  A fucking liar -

				WIFE
		Bucky, please!

	Jerry mumbles into his lap:

				JERRY
		One hunnert's the best we can
		do here.

				CUSTOMER
		Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my
		goddamn checkbook.  Let's get this
		over with.

	WIDE EXTERIOR:  TRUCK STOP

	There is a restaurant with many big rigs parked nearby, and
	a motel with an outsize Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox
	flanking its sign:  BLUE OX MOTEL.

	MOTEL ROOM

	Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are in the twin beds
	having sex with two truck-stop hookers.

				CARL
		Oh, Jesus, yeah.

				HIS HOOKER
		There ya go, sugar.

				GRIMSRUD
		Nnph.

				HIS HOOKER
		Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

	LATER

	The couples like in their respective beds, gazing at the
	offscreen TV.

				ED MCMAHON
		-  Johnny's guests tonight will be
		Lee Majors, George Wendt, and Steve
		Boutsikaros from the San Diego Zoo,
		so keep that dial -

	LUNDEGAARD KITCHEN

	We hear a morning show on television.  Jean Lundegaard is
	making coffee in the kitchen as Scott eats cereal at the
	table.

				JEAN
		I'm talkin' about your potential.

				SCOTT
			(absently)
		Uh-huh.

				JEAN
		You're not a C student.

				SCOTT
		Uhn.

				JEAN
		And yet you're gettin' C grades.
		It's this disparity there that
		concerns your dad and me.

				SCOTT
		Uh-huh.

				JEAN
		You know what a disparity is?

				SCOTT
			(testily)
		Yeah!

				JEAN
		Okay.  Well, that's why we don't
		want ya goin' out fer hockey.

				SCOTT
		Oh, man!

	The phone rings.

				SCOTT
		...  What's the big deal?  It's
		an hour -

				JEAN
		Hold on.

	She picks up the phone.

				JEAN
		...  Hello?

				PHONE VOICE
		Yah, hiya, hon.

				JEAN
		Oh, hiya, Dad.

				WADE
		Jerry around?

				JEAN
		Yah, he's still here - I'll

	She holds the phone away and calls:

				JEAN
		...  Hon?

				VOICE
		Yah.

				JEAN
		It's Dad.

				VOICE

	Jerry enters in shirtsleeves and tie.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, okay...

				SCOTT
		Look, Dad, there is no fucking

				JEAN
		Scott!

				JERRY
		Say, let's watch the language -

	He takes the phone.

				JERRY
		How ya doin', Wade?

				WADE
		What's goin' on there?

				JERRY
		Oh, nothing, Wade.  How ya doin'

				WADE
		Stan Grossman looked at your

				JERRY
		No kiddin'!  I'd need the cash

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		2:30.

	Click.  Dial tone.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay.

	GUSTAFSON OLD GARAGE

	Jerry wanders through the service area where cars are being
	worked on.  He stops by an Indian in blue jeans who is
	looking at the underside of a car that sits on a hydraulic
	lift with a cage light hanging off its innards.

				JERRY
		Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?

				SHEP
		Mm.

				JERRY
		Say, ya know those two fellas
		ya put me in touch with, up
		there in Fargo?

				SHEP
		Put you in touch with Grimsrud.

				JERRY
		Well, yah, but he had a buddy
		there.  He, uh -

				SHEP
		Well, I don't vouch for him.

				JERRY
		Well, that's okay, I just -

				SHEP
		I vouch for Grimsrud.  Who's his
		buddy?

				JERRY
		Carl somethin'?

				SHEP
		Never heard of him.  Don't vouch
		for him.

				JERRY
		Well, that's okay, he's a buddy
		of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm
		not worryin'.  I just, I was
		wonderin', see, I gotta get in
		touch with 'em for, I might not
		need it anymore, sumpn's happenin',
		see -

				SHEP
		Call 'em up.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, see, I did that, and
		I haven't been able to get 'em,
		so I thought you maybe'd know an
		alternate number or what have ya.

				SHEP
		Nope.

	Jerry slaps his fist into his open palm and snaps his
	fingers.

				JERRY
		Okay, well, real good, then.

	CAR

	Carl is driving.  Grimsrud stares out front.

	After a beat:

				CARL
		...  Look at that.  Twin Cities.
		IDS Building, the big glass one.
		Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.
		After the Sears, uh, Chicago...
		You never been to Minneapolis?

				GRIMSRUD
		No.

				CARL
		...  Would it kill you to say
		something?

				GRIMSRUD
		I did.

				CARL
		"No." First thing you've said
		in the last four hours.  That's
		a, that's a fountain of conversation,
		man.  That's a geyser.  I mean, whoa,
		daddy, stand back, man.  Shit, I'm
		sittin' here driving, man, doin'
		all the driving, whole fuckin' way
		from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to,
		you know, tryin' to chat, keep
		our spirits up, fight the boredom
		of the road, and you can't say one
		fucking thing just in the way of
		conversation.

	Grimsurd smokes, gazing out the window.

				CARL
		...  Well, fuck it, I don't have
		to talk either, man.  See how
		you like it...

	He drives.

				CARL
		...  Total silence...

	JERRY'S CUBICLE

	He is on the phone.

				JERRY
		Yah, real good.  How you doin'?

				VOICE
		Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.
		You're damned hard to get on the
		phone.

				JERRY
		Yah, it's pretty darned busy here,
		but that's the way we like it.

				VOICE
		That's for sure.  Now, I just
		need, on these last, these financing
		documents you sent us, I can't
		read the serial numbers of the
		vehicles on here, so I -

				JERRY
		But I already got the, it's okay,
		the loans are in place, I already
		got the, the what, the -

				VOICE
		Yeah, the three hundred and twenty
		thousand dollars, you got the money
		last month.

				JERRY
		Yah, so we're all set.

				VOICE
		Yeah, but the vehicles you were
		borrowing on, I just can't read
		the serial numbers on your
		applicaton.  Maybe if you could
		just read them to me -

				JERRY
		But the deal's already done, I
		already got the money -

				VOICE
		Yeah, but we have an audit here,
		I just have to know that these
		vehicles you're financing with
		this money, that they really
		exist.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, they exist all right.

				VOICE
		I'm sure they do - ha ha!  But
		I can't read their serial numbers
		here.  So if you could read me -

				JERRY
		Well, but see, I don't have 'em
		in front a me - why don't I just
		fax you over a copy -

				VOICE
		No, fax is no good, that's what
		I have and I can't read the darn
		thing -

				JERRY
		Yah, okay, I'll have my girl
		send you over a copy, then.

				VOICE
		Okay, because if I can't correlate
		this note with the specific vehicles,
		then I gotta call back that money -

				JERRY
		Yah, how much money was that?

				VOICE
		Three hundred and twenty thousand
		dollars.  See, I gotta correlate
		that money with the cars it's being
		lent on.

				JERRY
		Yah, no problem, I'll just fax
		that over to ya, then.

				VOICE
		No, no, fax is -

				JERRY
		I mean send it over.  I'll shoot
		it right over to ya.

				VOICE
		Okay.

				JERRY
		Okay, real good, then.

	CLOSE ON TELEVISION

	A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a
	kitchen set.

				HOST
		So I seperate the - how the heck
		do I get the egg out of the shell
		without breaking it?

	Jean Lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of
	coffee, watching the television.

				HOSTESS
		You just prick a little hole in
		the end and blow!

	Jean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio
	audience.  She hears something else - a faint scraping sound
	- and looks up.

				HOST
		Okay, here goes nothing.

	The scraping sound persists.  Jean sets down her coffee cup
	and rises.

	From the studio audience:

				AUDIENCE
		Awoooo!

	KITCHEN

	We track toward the back door.  A curtain is stretched tight
	across its window.

	Jean pulls the curtain back.  Bright sunlight amplified by
	snow floods in.

	A man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock.

	Jean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into -

	- a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house.

	We hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed.

	The tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jean's wrist.

	She screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps
	her gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites
	down hard.

	He drops her wrist.  As Carl enters, she races up the
	stairs.

				GRIMSRUD
		Unguent.

				CARL
		Huh?

	Grimsurd looks at his thumb.

				GRIMSRUD
		I need ... unguent.

	UPSTAIRS BEDROOM

	As the two men enter, a door at the far side is slamming
	shut.  A cord snakes in under the door.

	MASTER BATHROOM

	Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess
	phone.

	The phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile
	floor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its
	cord ripped free.

	With a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.

	BEDROOM

	Grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door
	and frame, and is working it.

	BATHROOM

	Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it
	open.  Snow that had drifted against the window sifts
	lightly in.  Jean steps up onto the toilet.

	The door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.

	Jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to
	the tank.

	The groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob
	splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor.

	The door swings open.

	Grimsrud and Carl enter.

	THEIR POV

	Room empty, window open.

	Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out.

	Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps
	aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent.

	He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing
	something in the mirror.

	The shower curtain is drawn around the tub.

	He steps toward it.

	As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated
	by thrashing limbs.

	Jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its
	rings and stumbles out into the bedroom.  Grimsrud follows.

	BEDROOM

	Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain
	but awkwardly trying to push it off.

	UPSTAIRS LANDING

	Still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,
	trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the
	stairs.

	Grimsrud trots down after her.

	A PLAQUE:  WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED

	INT. WADE'S OFFICE

	Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry
	enters.

				JERRY
		How ya doin' there, Stan?  How
		are ya, Wade?

	Stan Grossman shakes his hand.

				STAN
		Good to see ya again, Jerry.  If
		these numbers are right, this
		looks pretty sweet.

				JERRY
		Oh, those numbers are all right,
		bleemee.

				WADE
		This is do-able.

				STAN
		Congratulations, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -

				WADE
		What kind of finder's fee were
		you looking for?

				JERRY
		...  Huh?

				STAN
		The financials are pretty thorough,
		so the only thing we don't know
		is your fee.

				JERRY
		...  My fee?  Wade, what the
		heck're you talkin' about?

				WADE
		Stan and I're okay.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		We're good to loan in.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		But we never talked about your
		fee for bringin' it to us.

				JERRY
		No, but, Wade, see, I was
		bringin' you this deal for you
		to loan me the money to put
		in.  It's my deal here, see?

	Wade scowls, looks at Stan.

				STAN
		Jerry - we thought you were
		bringin' us an investment.

				JERRY
		Yah, right -

				STAN
		You're sayin' - what're you
		sayin'?

				WADE
		You're sayin' that we put in
		all the money and you collect
		when it pays off?

				JERRY
		No, no.  I - I'd, I'd - pay you
		back the principal, and interest
		- heck, I'd go - one over prime -

				STAN
		We're not a bank, Jerry.

	Wade is angry.

				WADE
		What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted
		bank interest on seven hunnert'n
		fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest
		Federal.  Talk to Bill Diehl.

				STAN
		He's at Norstar.

				WADE
		He's at -

				JERRY
		No, see, I don't need a finder's
		fee, I need - finder's fee's, what,
		ten percent, heck that's not gonna
		do it for me.  I need the principal.

				STAN
		Jerry, we're not just going to
		give you seven hundred and fifty
		thousand dollars.

				WADE
		What the heck were you thinkin'?
		Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank
		interest, I'd look for complete
		security.  Heck, FDIC.  I don't
		see nothin' like that here.

				JERRY
		Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd
		guarantee ya your money back.

				WADE
		I'm not talkin' about your damn
		word, Jerry.  Geez, what the
		heck're you?...  Well, look, I
		don't want to cut you out of the
		loop, but his here's a good deal.
		I assume, if you're not innarested,
		you won't mind if we move on it
		independently.

	PARKING LOT

	We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.
	Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly
	out at his sides, his breath vaporizing.  He goes to his
	car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper
	and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice
	that has developed on his windshield.

	The scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air.

	Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the
	windshield and the hood of his car.

	The tantrum passes.  Jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing
	in particular.

	Scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the
	windshield.

	FRONT DOOR

	A beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock.

	The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about,
	holding a sack of groceries.

				JERRY
		Hon?

	He shuts the door.

				JERRY
		...  Got the growshries...

	He has already seen the shower curtain on the floor.  He
	frowns, pokes at it with his foot.

				JERRY
		...  Hon?

	UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

	Jerry walks in.  He sets the groceries down on the toilet
	tank.

	He looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts
	in.  He shuts it.

	He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink,
	frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.

	He looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings.

	FOYER

	Once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain.

	From another room:

				JERRY
		Yah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I.

	Then, slightly more agitated.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's
		Jerry...

	Beat.

				JERRY
		...  Wade, it's Jerry, I - we
		gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible...

	Beat.

	LIVING ROOM

	Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a
	telephone.

	After a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in
	a number.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.

	BLACK

	Hold in black.

	A slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large
	paper-mache figure into frame.  It is a flannel-shirt
	woodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder.  As
	we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing
	tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a
	pedestal.

	A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal:
	WELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN.

	The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the
	background.  The two-lane highway is otherwise empty.

	INT. CAR

	Carl drives.  Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window.
	From the back seat we hear whimpering.

	Grimsrud turns to look.

	Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a
	tarpaulin.

				GRIMSRUD
		Shut the fuck up or I'll throw
		you back in the trunk, you know.

				CARL
		Geez.  That's more'n I've heard
		you say all week.

	Grimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window.

	At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear
	window.  Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on
	his gumballs.

	Carl eases the car onto the shoulder.

				CARL
		Ah, shit, the tags...

	Grimsrud looks at him.

				CARL
		...  It's just the tags.  I never
		put my tags on the car.  Don't
		worry, I'll take care of this.

	He looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on
	the gravel shoulder.

				CARL
		...  Let's keep still back there,
		lady, or we're gonna have to, ya
		know, to shoot ya.

	Grimsrud stares at Carl.

				CARL
		...  Hey!  I'll take care of this!

	Both cars have stopped.  Carl looks up at the rear-view
	mirror.

	The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them,
	writing in his citation book.

	Carl watches.

	We hear the trooper's door open.

	The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly
	on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night
	air.

	Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up.

				CARL
		How can I help you, officer?

	The trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time.

	Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.

	Finally:

				TROOPER
		This is a new car, then, sir?

				CARL
		It certainly is, officer.  Still
		got that smell!

				TROOPER
		You're required to display
		temporary tags, either in the
		plate area or taped inside the
		back window.

				CARL
		Certainly -

				TROOPER
		Can I see your license and
		registration please?

				CARL
		Certainly.

	He reaches for his wallet.

				CARL
		...  I was gonna tape up the
		temporary tag, ya know, to be
		in full compliance, but it, uh,
		it, uh ... must a slipped my
		mind...

	He extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty-
	dollar bill protruding from it.

				CARL
		...  So maybe the best thing
		would be to take care of that,
		right here in Brainerd.

				TROOPER
		What's this, sir?

				CARL
		That's my license and regis-
		tration.  I wanna be in
		compliance.

	He forces a laugh.

				CARL
		...  I was just thinking I could
		take care of it right here.  In
		Brainerd.

	The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold
	and hands the billfold back into the car.

				TROOPER
		Put that back in your pocket,
		please.

	Carl's nervous smile fades.

				TROOPER
		...  And step out of the car,
		please, sir.

	Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.

	There is a whimpering sound.

	The policeman hesitates.

	Another sound.

	The policeman leans forward into the car, listening.

	Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair
	and slams his head down onto the car door.

	The policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and
	throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car.

	With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment.  He
	brings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG -
	into the back of the trooper's head.

	Jean screams.

				GRIMSRUD
		Shut up.

	He releases the policeman.

	The policeman's head slides out the window and his body
	flops back onto the street.

	Carl looks out at the cop in the road.

				CARL
			(softly)
		Whoa...  Whoa, Daddy.

	Grimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails
	it out the open window.

				GRIMSRUD
		You'll take care of it.  Boy, you
		are smooth smooth, you know.

				CARL
		Whoa, Daddy.

	Jean, for some reason, screams again.  Then stops.

				GRIMSRUD
		Clear him off the road.

				CARL
		Yeah.

	He gets out.

	EXT. ROAD

	Carl leans down to hoist up the body.

	Headlights appear:  an oncoming car.

	INT. CIERA

	Grimsrud notices.

	EXT. ROAD

	The car approaches, slowing.

	Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen
	in the headlights.

	The car accelerates and roars past and away.  We just make
	out the silhouettes of two occupants in front.

	INT. CIERA

	Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat.  He squeals into a U-
	turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin.

	Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead.  The pursued car
	churns up fine snow.

	Grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in
	his ashtray.  We hear the churning of the car wheels and the
	pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside.

	In the back seat, Jean starts screaming.

	Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights.

	He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.

	The red tail lights ahead start to turn.  With a distant
	crunching sound, they disappear.

	The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn.

	Grimsrud frowns and slows.

	His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled
	around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn.

	Grimsrud brakes.

	Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell.

	Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his
	door and gets out.

	EXT. ROAD

	The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield
	abutting the highway.  A young man in a down parka is
	limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car.

	Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy.  He
	raises his gun and fires.

	With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back
	and he pitches into the snow.

	Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open
	door.

	A young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage,
	injured.

	Snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck.

	Grimsrud raises his gun and fires.

	AN OIL PAINTING

	A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland.  The
	room in which it hangs is dark.  We hear off-screen snoring.

	We track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half-
	completed oil of a grey mallard.

	The continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping.  The
	man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied.  His
	mouth is agape.  He snores.  His arms are flung over a woman
	in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not
	snoring.

	We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and
	snoring.

	The phone rings.

	The woman stirs.

				WOMAN
		Oh, geez...

	She reaches for the phone.

				WOMAN
		...  Hi, it's Marge...

	The man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble.

				MARGE
		...  Oh, my.  Where?...  Yah...
		Oh, geez...

	The man sits up, gazes stupidly about.

				MARGE
		...  Okay.  There in a jif...
		Real good, then.

	She hangs up.

				MARGE
		...  You can sleep, hon.  It's
		early yet.

				MAN
		Gotta go?

				MARGE
		Yah.

	The man swings his legs out.

				MAN
		I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		That's okay, hon.  I gotta run.

				MAN
		Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.
		I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		Aw, you can sleep, hon.

				MAN
		Ya gotta eat a breakfast...

	He clears his throat with another deep rumble.

				MAN
		...  I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		Aw, Norm.

	PLATE

	Leavings of a huge plate of eggs, ham, toast.

	Wider, we see Marge now wearing a beige police uniform.  A
	patch on one arm says BRAINERD POLICE DEPARTMENT.  She wears
	a heavy belt holding a revolver, walkie-talkie and various
	other jangling police impedimenta.  Norm is in a dressing
	gown.

				MARGE
		Thanks, hon.  Time to shove off.

				NORM
		Love ya, Margie.

	As she struggles into a parka:

				MARGE
		Love ya, hon.

	He is exiting back to the bedroom; she exits out the front
	door.

	EXT. GUNDERSON HOUSE

	Dawn.  Marge is making her way down the icy front stoop to
	her prowler.

	INT. GUNDERSON HOUSE

	Norm sits back onto the bed, shrugging off his robe.  Off-
	screen we hear the front door open.

	FRONT DOOR

	Marge stamps the snow off her shoes.

				MARGE
		Hon?

				NORM
			(off)
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Prowler needs a jump.

	HIGHWAY

	Two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of
	the road, a pair of men inside each car.

	The first car's driver door opens and a figure in a parka
	emerges, holding two styrofoam cups.  His partner leans
	across the seat to close the door after him.

	The reverse shows Marge approaching from her own squad car.

				MARGE
		Hiya, Lou.

				LOU
		Margie.  Thought you might need
		a little warm-up.

	He hands her one of the cups of coffee.

				MARGE
		Yah, thanks a bunch.  So what's
		the deal, now?  Gary says triple
		homicide?

				LOU
		Yah, looks pretty bad.  Two
		of'm're over here.

	Marge looks around as they start walking.

				MARGE
		Where is everybody?

				LOU
		Well - it's cold, Margie.

	BY THE WRECK

	Laid out in the early morning light is the wrecked car, a
	pair of footprints leading out to a man in a bright orange
	parka face down in the bloodstained snow, and one pair of
	footsteps leading back to the road.

	Marge is peering into the car.

				MARGE
		Ah, geez.  So...  Aw, geez.
		Here's the second one...  It's
		in the head and the ... hand
		there, I guess that's a defensive
		wound.  Okay.

	Marge looks up from the car.

				MARGE
		...  Where's the state trooper?

	Lou, up on the shoulder, jerks his thumb.

				LOU
		Back there a good piece.  In
		the ditch next to his prowler.

	Marge looks around at the road.

				MARGE
		Okay, so we got a state trooper
		pulls someone over, we got a
		shooting, and these folks drive
		by, and we got a high-speed
		pursuit, ends here, and this
		execution-type deal.

				LOU
		Yah.

				MARGE
		I'd be very surprised if our
		suspect was from Brainerd.

				LOU
		Yah.

	Marge is studying the ground.

				MARGE
		Yah.  And I'll tell you what, from
		his footprints he looks like a big
		fella -

	Marge suddenly doubles over, putting her head between her
	knees down near the snow.

				LOU
		Ya see something down there, Chief?

				MARGE
		Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.

				LOU
		Geez, you okay, Margie?

				MARGE
		I'm fine - it's just morning
		sickness.

	She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees.

				MARGE
		...  Well, that passed.

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah.  Now I'm hungry again.

				LOU
		You had breakfast yet, Margie?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah.  Norm made some eggs.

				LOU
		Yah?  Well, what now, d'ya think?

				MARGE
		Let's go take a look at that
		trooper.

	BY THE STATE TROOPER'S CAR

	Marge's prowler is parked nearby.

	Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch,
	again looking at footprints in the snow.  She calls up to
	the road:

				MARGE
		There's two of 'em, Lou!

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah, this guy's smaller than
		his buddy.

				LOU
		Oh, yah?

	DOWN IN THE DITCH

	In the foreground is the head of the state trooper, facing
	us.  Peering at it from behind, still on her hands and
	knees, is Marge.

				MARGE
		For Pete's sake.

	She gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out
	of the ditch.

				LOU
		How's it look, Marge?

				MARGE
		Well, he's got his gun on his hip
		there, and he looks like a nice
		enough guy.  It's a real shame.

				LOU
		Yah.

				MARGE
		You haven't monkeyed with his car
		there, have ya?

				LOU
		No way.

	She is looking at the prowler, which still idles on the
	shoulder.

				MARGE
		Somebody shut his lights.  I guess
		the little guy sat in there, waitin'
		for his buddy t'come back.

				LOU
		Yah, woulda been cold out here.

				MARGE
		Heck, yah.  Ya think, is Dave open
		yet?

				LOU
		You don't think he's mixed up in -

				MARGE
		No, no, I just wanna get Norm some
		night crawlers.

	INT. PROWLER

	Marge is driving; Lou sits next to her.

				MARGE
		You look in his citation book?

				LOU
		Yah...

	He looks at his notebook.

				LOU
		...  Last vehicle he wrote in
		was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.
		Under the plate number he put
		DLR - I figure they stopped him
		or shot him before he could finish
		fillin' out the tag number.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				LOU
		So I got the state lookin' for a
		Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.
		They don't got no match yet.

				MARGE
		I'm not sure I agree with you a
		hunnert percent on your policework,
		there, Lou.

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah, I think that vehicle there
		probly had dealer plates.  DLR?

				LOU
		Oh...

	Lou gazes out the window, thinking.

				LOU
		...  Geez.

				MARGE
		Yah.  Say, Lou, ya hear the one
		about the guy who couldn't afford
		personalized plates, so he went
		and changed his name to J2L 4685?

				LOU
		Yah, that's a good one.

				MARGE
		Yah.

	THE ROAD

	The police car enters with a whoosh and hums down a straight-
	ruled empty highway, cutting a landscape of flat and perfect
	white.

	EMBERS FAMILY RESTAURANT

	Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit in a booth, sipping
	coffee.  Outside the window, snow falls from a gunmetal sky.

				WADE
		-  All's I know is, ya got a
		problem, ya call a professional!

				JERRY
		No!  They said no cops!  They were
		darned clear on that, Wade!  They
		said you call the cops and we -

				WADE
		Well, a course they're gonna say
		that!  But where's my protection?
		They got Jean here!  I give these
		sons a bitches a million dollars,
		where's my guarantee they're gonna
		let her go.

				JERRY
		Well, they -

				WADE
		A million dollars is a lot a damn
		money!  And there they are, they
		got my daughter!

				JERRY
		Yah, but think this thing through
		here, Wade.  Ya give 'em what they
		want, why wont' they let her go?
		You gotta listen to me on this one,
		Wade.

				WADE
		Heck, you don't know!  You're just
		whistlin' Dixie here!  I'm sayin',
		the cops, they can advise us on
		this!  I'm sayin' call a professional!

				JERRY
		No!  No cops!  That's final!  This
		is my deal here, Wade!  Jean is
		my wife here!

				STAN
		I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin'
		to Jerry's viewpoint here.

				WADE
		Well -

				STAN
		We gotta protect Jean.  These -
		we're not holdin' any cards here,
		Wade, they got all of 'em.  So
		they call the shots.

				JERRY
		You're darned tootin'!

				WADE
		Ah, dammit!

				STAN
		I'm tellin' ya.

				WADE
		Well...  Why don't we...

	He saws a finger under his nose.

				WADE
		...  Stan, I'm thinkin' we should
		offer 'em half a million.

				JERRY
		Now come on here, no way, Wade!
		No way!

				STAN
		We're not horse-trading here, Wade,
		we just gotta bite the bullet on
		this thing.

				JERRY
		Yah!

				STAN
		What's the next step here, Jerry?

				JERRY
		They're gonna call, give me
		instructions for a drop.  I'm
		supposed to have the money ready
		tomorrow.

				WADE
		Dammit!

	THE CASHIER

	She rings up two dollars forty.

				CASHIER
		How was everything today?

				JERRY
		Yah, real good now.

	PARKING LOT

	Snow continues to fall.  Jerry and Stan stand bundled in
	their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles.
	Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for
	Stan.

				STAN
		Okay.  We'll get the money together.
		Don't worry about it, Jerry.  Now,
		d'you want anyone at home, with you,
		until they call?

				JERRY
		No, I - they don't want - they're
		just s'posed to be dealin' with
		me, they were real clear.

				STAN
		Yah.

	Jerry pounds his mittened hands together against the cold.

				JERRY
		Ya know, they said no one listenin'
		in, they'll be watchin', ya know.
		Maybe it's all bull, but like you
		said, Stan, they're callin' the
		shots.

				STAN
		Okay.  And Scotty, is he gonna
		be all right?

				JERRY
		Yah, geez, Scotty.  I'll go talk
		to him.

	There is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the
	Lincoln.

				STAN
		We'll call.

	The Lincoln spits snow as it grinds out of the lot and
	fishtails out onto the boulevard.

	SCOTTY'S BEDROOM

	Scotty lies on the bed, weeping.  Jerry enters and perches
	uncomfortably on the edge of his bed.

				JERRY
		...  How ya doin' there, Scotty?

				SCOTT
		Dad!  What're they doing?  Wuddya
		think they're doin' with Mom?

				JERRY
		It's okay, Scotty.  They're not
		gonna want to hurt her any.
		These men, they just want money,
		see.

				SCOTT
		What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?

				JERRY
		No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here.
		Grandad and I, we're - we're makin'
		sure this gets handled right.

	Scott snorfles and sits up.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I really think we should call
		the cops.

				JERRY
		No!  We can't let anyone know about
		this thing!  We gotta play ball with
		these guys - you ask Stan Grossman,
		he'll tell ya the same thing!

				SCOTT
		Yeah, but -

				JERRY
		We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but
		we gotta play ball.  Ya know, that's
		the deal.  Now if Lorraine calls, or
		Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in
		Florida with Pearl and Marty...

	Scotty starts to weep again.  Jerry stares down at his lap.

				JERRY
		...  That's the best we can do here.

	EXT. CABIN

	It is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white.  A brown Ciera
	with dealer plates is pulling into the drive.

	Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out
	of the driver's.  Grimsrud opens the back door and, with an
	arm on her elbow, helps Jean out.  She has her hands tied
	behind her and a black hood over her head.

	With a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and
	lurches away across the front lawn.  Grimsrud moves to
	retrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his
	shoulder.

				CARL
		Hold it.

	They both look out at the front lawn, Grimsrud
	expressionless, Carl smiling.

	With muffled cries, the hooded woman lurches across the
	unbroken snow, staggering this way and that, stumbling on
	the uneven terrain.

	She stops, stands still, her hooded head swaying.

	She lurches out in an arbitrary direction.  Going downhill,
	she reels, staggers, and falls face-first into the snow,
	weeping.

				CARL
		Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Jesus!

	Grimsrud, still expressionless, breaks away from Carl's
	restraining hand to retrieve her.

	BRAINERD POLICE HEADQUARTERS

	We track behind Marge as she makes her way across the floor,
	greeting various officers.  She holds a small half-full
	paper sack.

	Beyond her we see a small glassed-in cublcle.  Norm sits at
	the desk inside with a box lunch spread out in front of him.
	There is lettering on the cubicle's glass door:  BRAINERD
	PD. CHIEF GUNDERSON.

	Marge enters and sits behind the desk, detaching her walkie-
	talkie from her utility belt to accomodate the seat.

				MARGE
		Hiya, hon.

	She slides the paper sack toward him.

				NORM
		Brought ya some lunch, Margie.
		What're those, night crawlers?

	He looks inside.

	The bottom of the sack is full of fat, crawling earthworms.

				MARGE
		Yah.

				NORM
		Thanks, hon.

				MARGE
		You bet.  Thanks for lunch.  What
		do we got here, Arbie's?

				NORM
		Uh-huh.

	She starts eating.

				MARGE
		...  How's the paintin' goin'?

				NORM
		Pretty good.  Found out the Hautmans
		are entering a painting this year.

				MARGE
		Aw, hon, you're better'n them.

				NORM
		They're real good.

				MARGE
		They're good, Norm, but you're
		better'n them.

				NORM
		Yah, ya think?

	He leans over and kisses her.

				MARGE
		Ah, ya got Arbie's all o'er me.

	Lou enters.

				LOU
		Hiya, Norm, how's the paintin'
		goin'?

				NORM
		Not too bad.  You know.

				MARGE
		How we doin' on that vehicle?

				LOU
		No motels registered any tan Ciera
		last night.  But the night before,
		two men checked into the Blue Ox
		registering a Ciera and leavin' the
		tag space blank.

				MARGE
		Geez, that's a good lead.  The
		Blue Ox, that's that trucker's
		joint out there on I-35?

				LOU
		Yah.  Owner was on the desk then,
		said these two guys had company.

				MARGE
		Oh, yah?

	EXT. STRIPPER CLUB

	Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot.  Snow
	drifts down.

	INT. STRIPPER CLUB

	Marge sits talking with two young women at one end of an
	elevated dance platform.  The club, not yet open for
	business, is deserted.

				MARGE
		Where you girls from?

				HOOKER ONE
		Chaska.

				HOOKER TWO
		LeSeure.  But I went to high school
		in White Bear Lake.

				MARGE
		Okay, I want you to tell me what
		these fellas looked like.

				HOOKER ONE
		Well, the little guy, he was
		kinda funny-looking.

				MARGE
		In what way?

				HOOKER ONE
		I dunno.  Just funny-looking.

				MARGE
		Can you be any more specific?

				HOOKER ONE
		I couldn't really say.  He wasn't
		circumcised.

				MARGE
		Was he funny-looking apart from
		that?

				HOOKER ONE
		Yah.

				MARGE
		So you were having sex with the
		little fella, then?

				HOOKER ONE
		Uh-huh.

				MARGE
		Is there anything else you can
		tell me about him?

				HOOKER ONE
		No.  Like I say, he was funny-looking.
		More'n most people even.

				MARGE
		And what about the other fella?

				HOOKER TWO
		He was a little older.  Looked like
		the Marlboro man.

				MARGE
		Yah?

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.  Maybe I'm sayin' that cause
		he smoked Marlboros.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				HOOKER TWO
		A subconscious-type thing.

				MARGE
		Yah, that can happen.

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.

				HOOKER ONE
		They said they were goin' to the
		Twin Cities?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah?

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.

				HOOKER ONE
		Yah.  Is that useful to ya?

				MARGE
		Oh, you bet, yah.

	EXT. LAKESIDE CABIN

	It is now dusk.  The brown Ciera with dealer plates still
	sits in the drive.

	INT. CABIN

	We track in on Jean Lundegaard, who sits tied in a chair
	with the black hood still over her head.  As we track in, we
	hear inarticulate cursing, intermittent banging and loud
	static.

	We track in on Gaear Grimsrud, who sits smoking a cigarette
	and expressionlessly gazing offscreen.

	We track in on Carl Showalter, who stands over an old black-
	and-white television.  It plays nothing but snow.  Carl is
	banging on it as he mutters:

				CARL
		...days ... be here for days with
		a - DAMMIT! - a goddamn mute ...
		nothin' to do ... and the fucking -
		DAMMIT!...

	Each "dammit" brings a pound of his fist on the TV.

				CARL
		...  TV doesn't even ... plug me
		in, man...  Gimmee a - DAMMIT! -
		signal...  Plug me into the
		ozone, baby...  Plug me into the
		ozone - FUCK!...

	With one last bang we cut:

	BACK TO THE TELEVISION SET

	In extreme close-up an insect is lugging a worm.

				TV VOICE-OVER
		The bark beetle carries the worm
		to the nest ... where it will feed
		its young for up to six weeks...

	A pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's
	house.

	Marge and Norm are watching television in bed.  From the TV
	we hear insects chirring.

	After a long beat, silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs,
	still looking at the set:

				MARGE
		...  Well, I'm turnin' in, Norm.

	Also looking at the TV:

				NORM
		...  Oh, yah?

	Marge rolls over and Norm continues to watch.

	We hold.

	BLACK

	Hold.

	A snowflake drops through the black.

	Another flake.

	It starts snowing.

	BRAINERD MAIN STREET

	The lone traffic light blinks slowly, steadily, red.  Snow
	sifts down.  There is no other movement.

	PAUL BUNYAN

	We are looking up at the bottom-lit statue.  Snow falls.

	HIGH SHOT OF MARGE'S HOUSE

	Snow drops away.

	HIGH SHOT IN MARGE'S BEDROOM

	The bedroom is dark.  Norm is snoring.

	The phone rings.

	Marge gropes in the dark.

				MARGE
		Hello?

				VOICE
		Yah, is this Marge?

				MARGE
		Yah?

				VOICE
		Margie Olmstead?

				MARGE
		...  Well, yah.  Who's this?

				VOICE
		This is Mike Yanagita.  Ya know
		- Mike Yanagita.  Remember me?

				MARGE
		...  Mike Yanagita!

				MIKE
		Yah!

	Marge props herself up next to the still-sleeping Norm.

				MARGE
		Yah, yah, course I remember.
		How are ya?  What time is it?

				MIKE
		Oh, geez.  It's quarter to eleven.
		I hope I dint wake you.

				MARGE
		No, that's okay.

				MIKE
		Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities
		and I was just watching on TV
		about these shootings up in
		Brainderd, and I saw you on the
		news there.

				MARGE
		Yah.

				MIKE
		I thought, geez, is that Margie
		Olmstead?  I can't believe it!

				MARGE
		Yah, that's me.

				MIKE
		Well, how the heck are ya?

				MARGE
		Okay, ya know.  Okay.

				MIKE
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah - how are you doon?

		Oh, pretty good.

				MARGE
		Heck, it's been such a long time,
		Mike.  It's great to hear from ya.

				MIKE
		Yah...  Yah, yah.  Geeze, Margie!

	He sits in and picks up his phone.

				JERRY
		Jerry Lundegaard.

		All right, Jerry, you got this

				JERRY
		Well ... yah.

				JERRY
		What the heck're you talkin' about?
		Let's just finish up this deal
		here -

				CARL
		Blood has been shed, Jerry.

	Jerry sits dumbly.  The voice solemnly repeats:

				CARL
		...  Blood has been shed.

				JERRY
		What the heck d'ya mean?

				CARL
		Three people.  In Brainerd.

				JERRY
		Oh, geez.

				CARL

				JERRY
		...  The heck d'ya mean?

				CARL
		I'll see you tomorrow.

	Click.

	Jerry slams down the phone, which immediately rings.  He
	angrily snatches it up.

				JERRY
		Yah!

				VOICE
		Jerome Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Yah!

				VOICE
		This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC.
		Sir, I have not yet recieved those

		Good day, sir.

				JERRY
		...  Yah.

	WIDE ON THE CUBICLE

	We are looking at Jerry's cubicle from across the showroom.
	Noise muted by distance, we watch Jerry slam down the
	reciever, rise to his feet, fling the phone to the floor,
	raise his desk blotter high over his head with pens and
	pencils rolling off it and slam it onto his desktop.

	He stands for a moment, hands on hips, glaring.

	He stoops and picks up the phone, places it back on the
	desktop, starts picking up the pens and pencils.

	TRACK

	On steam-table bins of food, each identified by a plaque:
	BEEF STROGANOFF, SWEDISH MEATBALLS, BROILED TORSK, CHICKEN
	FLORENTINE.

	A complementary track shows two rays being pushed along a
	buffet line, piled high with many foods.

	MARGE AND NORM AT A TABLE

	They sit next to each other at a long cafateria-style
	Formica table, silently eating.

	A hip with a hissing walkie-talkie enters frame.

				GARY
		Hiya, Norm.  How ya doin', Margie?
		How's the fricasse?

				MARGE
		Pretty darn good, ya want some?

				GARY
		No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought
		you were goin' fishin' up at Mile
		Lacs?

				NORM
		Yah, after lunch.

	He goes back to his food.

				MARGE
		Whatcha got there?

	Gary hands her a flimsy.  Marge takes it with one hand and
	looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food.

				GARY
		The numbers y'asked for, calls
		made from the lobby pay phone
		at the Blue Ox.  Two to Minneapolis
		that night.

				MARGE
		Mm.

				GARY
		First one's a trucking company,
		second one's a private residence.
		A Shep Proudfoot.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh...  A what?

				GARY
		Shep Proudfoot.  That's a name.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				GARY
		Yah.

				MARGE
		...  Yah, okay, I think I'll
		drive down there, then.

				GARY
		Oh, yah?  Twin Cities?

	Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at
	Marge with mild interest.  He stares for a beat as he
	finishes chewing, and them swallows and says:

				NORM
		...  Oh, yah?

	KITCHEN OF LUNDEGAARD HOUSE

	Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table.
	It is night.  The scene is harshly toplit by a hanging
	fixture.  On the table are the remains of coffee and a
	cinammon filbert ring.

				WADE
		Dammit!  I wanna be a part a
		this thing!

				JERRY
		No, Wade!  They were real clear!
		They said they'd call tomorrow,
		with instructions, and it's gonna
		be delivered by me alone!

				WADE
		It's my money, I'll deliver it
		- what do they care?

				STAN
		Wade's got a point there.  I'll
		handle the call if you want, Jerry.

				JERRY
		No, no.  See - they, no, see, they
		only deal with me.  Ya feel this,
		this nervousness on the phone there,
		they're very - these guys're
		dangerous -

				WADE
		All the more reason!  I don't want
		you - with all due respect, Jerry
		- I don't want you mucking this up.

				JERRY
		The heck d'ya mean?

				WADE
		They want my money, they can deal
		with me.  Otherwise I'm goin' to
		a professional.

	He points at a briefcase.

				WADE
		...  There's a million dollars
		here!

				JERRY
		No, see -

				WADE
		Look, Jerry, you're not sellin'
		me a damn car.  It's my show here.
		That's that.

				STAN
		It's the way we prefer to handle
		it, Jerry.

	THE DOWNTOWN RADISSON HOTEL

	Marge is at the reception desk.

				MARGE
		How ya doin'?

				CLERK
		Real good.  How're you today, ma'am?

				MARGE
		Real good.  I'm Mrs. Gunderson, I
		have a reservation.

	The clerk types into a computer console.

				CLERK
		You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

				MARGE
		Is there a phone down here, ya think?

	LOBBY CORNER

	Marge is on a public phone.

				MARGE
		...  Detective Sibert?  Yah, this
		is Marge Gunderson from up Brainerd,
		we spoke -  Yah.  Well, actually
		I'm in town here.  I had to do a
		few things in the Twin Cities, so
		I thought I'd check in with ya about
		that USIF search on Shep Proudfoot...
		Oh, yah?...  Well, maybe I'll go
		visit with him if I have the...  No,
		I can find that...  Well, thanks a
		bunch.  Say, d'ya happen to know a
		good place for lunch in the downtown
		area?...  Yah, the Radisson...  Oh,
		yah?  Is it reasonable?

	A GREEN FREEWAY SIGN

	Through a windshield we see a sign for the MINNEAPOLIS
	INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

	ROOFTOP PARKING LOT

	The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy S-curves around the
	few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot.

	It stops by one car and Carl emerges.  He quickly scans the
	lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car
	and starts unscrewing its license plate.

	EXIT BOOTH

	Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket.

				CARL
		Yeah, I decided not to park here.

	The attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket.

				ATTENDANT
		...  What do you mean, you decided
		not to park here?

				CARL
		Yeah, I just came in.  I decided
		not to park here.

	The attendant is still puzzled.

				ATTENDANT
		You, uh...  I'm sorry, sir, but -

				CARL
		I decided not to - I'm, uh, not
		taking the trip as it turns out.

				ATTENDANT
		I'm sorry, sir, we do have to
		charge you the four dollars.

				CARL
		I just pulled in here.  I just
		fucking pulled in here!

				ATTENDANT
		Well, see, there's a minimum charge
		of four dollars.  Long-term parking
		charges by the day.

	A car behind beeps.  Carl glances back, starts digging for
	money.

				CARL
		I guess you think, ya know, you're
		an authority figure.  With that
		stupid fucking uniform.  Huh, buddy?

	The attendant doesn't say anything.

				CARL
		...  King Clip-on Tie here.  Big
		fucking man.

	He is peeling off one dollar bills.

				CARL
		...  You know, these are the limits
		of your life, man.  Ruler of your
		little fucking gate here.  There's
		your four dollars.  You pathetic
		piece of shit.

	GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	Jerry is staring up, mouth agape, at the underside of a car
	on a hydraulic lift.  Bewildered, he looks about, then asks
	a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the
	shop.

				JERRY
		Where's Shep?

	The mechanic points.

				MECHANIC
		Talkin' to a cop.

	Jerry looks.

				JERRY
		...  Cop?

	Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor
	in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle.

				MECHANIC
		Said she was a policewoman.

	Marge and Shep silently talk.

	Jerry stares, swallows.

	INSIDE THE CUBICLE

				MARGE
		- Wednesday night?

	Shep is shaking his head.

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		Well, you do reside their at
		1425 Fremont Terrace?

				SHEP
		Yep.

				MARGE
		Anyone else residing there?

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
		came in past three in the morning.
		It's just hard for me to believe
		you can't remember anyone calling.

	Shep says nothing.

				MARGE
		...  Now, I know you've had some
		problems, struggling with the
		narcotics, some other entanglements,
		currently on parole -

				SHEP
		So?

				MARGE
		Well, associating with criminals,
		if you're the one they talked to,
		that right there would be a
		violation of your parole and would
		end with you back in Stillwater.

				SHEP
		Uh-huh.

				MARGE
		Now, I saw some rough stuff on
		your priors, but nothing in the
		nature of a homicide...

	Shep stares at her.

				MARGE
		...  I know you don't want to be
		an accessory to something like
		that.

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		So you think you might remember
		who those folks were who called
		ya?

	JERRY'S OFFICE

	Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk.  At a noise he
	looks up.

	Marge has stuck her head in the door.

				MARGE
		Mr. Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Huh?  Yah?

				MARGE
		I wonder if I could take just a
		minute of your time here -

				JERRY
		What...  What is it all about?

				MARGE
		Huh?  Do you mind if I sit down
		- I'm carrying quite a load here.

	Marge plops into the chair opposite him.

				MARGE
		...  You're the owner here, Mr.
		Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Naw, I...  Executive Sales Manager.

				MARGE
		Well, you can help me.  My name's
		Marge Gunderson -

				JERRY
		My father-in-law, he's the owner.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.  Well, I'm a police officer
		from up Brainerd investigating some
		malfeasance and I was just wondering
		if you've had any new vehicles stolen
		off the lot in the past couple of
		weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass
		Ciera?

	Jerry stares at her, his mouth open.

				MARGE
		...  Mr. Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		...  Brainerd?

				MARGE
		Yah.  Yah.  Home a Paul Bunyan and
		Babe the Blue Ox.

				JERRY
		...  Babe the Blue Ox?

				MARGE
		Yah, ya know we've got the big
		statue there.  So you haven't had
		any vehicles go missing, then?

				JERRY
		No.  No, ma'am.

				MARGE
		Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch.  I'll
		let you get back to your paperwork,
		then.

	As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on
	the desk in front of him.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, okay.

	He looks up at Marge's retreating back.  He looks back down
	at the papers.  He looks over at the phone.

	he picks up the phone and dials four digits.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, gimmee Shep...  The
		heck d'ya mean?...  Well, where'd
		he go?  It's only...  No, I don't
		need a mechanic - oh, geez - I

	Marge enters.  She looks around the bar, a rather
	characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people.

				VOICE
		Marge?

	It is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising
	from a booth halfway back.  His features are broad,
	friendly, Asian-American.

				MARGE
		Mike!

	He approaches somewhat carefully, as if on his second drink.
	They hug and head back toward the booth.

				MIKE
		Geez!  You look great!

				MARGE
		Yah - easy there - you do too!
		I'm expecting, ya know.

				MIKE
		I see that!  That's great!

	A waitress meets them at the table.

				MIKE
		...  What can I get ya?

				MARGE
		Just a Diet Coke.

	Again she glances about.

				MARGE
		...  This is a nice place.

				MIKE
		Yah, ya know it's the Radisson,
		so it's pretty good.

				MARGE
		You're livin' in Edina, then?

				MIKE
		Oh, yah, couple years now.  It's
		actually Eden Prarie - that school
		district.  So Chief Gunderson, then!
		So ya went and married Norm Son-of-
		a-Gunderson!

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, a long time ago.

				MIKE
		Great.  What brings ya down - are
		ya down here on that homicide -
		if you're allowed, ya know, to
		discuss that?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva
		lot to discuss.  What about you,
		Mike?  Are you married - you have
		kids?

				MIKE
		Well, yah, I was married.  I was
		married to -  You mind if I sit
		over here?

	He is sliding out of his side of the booth and easing in
	next to Marge.

				MIKE
		...  I was married to Linda
		Cooksey -

				MARGE
		No, I -  Mike - wyncha sit over
		there, I'd prefer that.

				MIKE
		Huh?  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

				MARGE
		No, just so I can see ya, ya know.
		Don't have to turn my neck.

				MIKE
		Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't
		mean to -

				MARGE
		No, no, that's fine.

				MIKE
		Yah, sorry, so I was married to
		Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?
		She was a year behind us.

				MARGE
		I think I remember Linda, yah.
		She was - yah.  So things didn't
		work out, huh?

				MIKE
		And then I, and then I been workin'
		for Honeywell for a few years now.

				MARGE
		Well, they're a good outfit.

				MIKE
		Yah, if you're an engineer, yah,
		you could do a lot worse.  Of
		course, it's not, uh, it's
		nothin' like your achievement.

				MARGE
		It sounds like you're doin' really
		super.

				MIKE
		Yah, well, I, uh ... it's not that
		it didn't work out -  Linda passed
		away.  She, uh...

				MARGE
		I'm sorry.

				MIKE
		Yah, I, uh...  She had leukemia,
		you know...

				MARGE
		No, I didn't...

				MIKE
		It was a tough, uh ... it was a
		long -  She fought real hard,
		Marge...

				MARGE
		I'm sorry, Mike.

				MIKE
		Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what
		can I say?...

	He holds up his drink.

				MIKE
		...  Better times, huh?

	Marge clinks it.

				MARGE
		Better times.

				MIKE
		I was so...  I been so ... and
		then I saw you on TV, and I
		remembered, ya know...  I always
		liked you...

				MARGE
		Well, I always liked you, Mike.

				MIKE
		I always liked ya so much...

				MARGE
		It's okay, Mike -  Should we get
		together another time, ya think?

				MIKE
		No - I'm sorry!  It's just -  I
		been so lonely - then I saw you,
		and...

	He is weeping.

				MIKE
		...  I'm sorry...  I shouldn't a
		done this...  I thought we'd have
		a really terrific time, and now
		I've...

				MARGE
		It's okay...

				MIKE
		You were such a super lady ...
		and then I...  I been so lonely...

				MARGE
		It's okay, Mike...

	CARLTON CELEBRITY ROOM

	Carl Showalter is sitting at a small table with a tarty-
	looking blonde in a low-cut gown.  Each holds a drink.

				CARL
		Just in town on business.  Just
		in and out.  Ha ha!  A little of
		the old in-and-out!

				WOMAN
		Wuddya do?

	Carl looks around.

				CARL
		Have ya been to the Celebrity Room
		before?  With other, uh, clients?

				WOMAN
		I don't think so.  It's nice.

				CARL
		Yeah, well, it depends on the artist.
		You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no
		complaints.  Waiter!

	The reverse shows a disappearing waiter and the backs of
	many, many people sitting at tables between us and the very
	distant stage.  Jose Feliciano, very small, performs on a
	spotlit stool.  The acoustics are poor.

	Carl grimaces.

				CARL
		...  What is he, deaf?...  So,
		uh, how long have you been with
		the escort service?

				WOMAN
		I don't know.  Few munce.

				CARL
		Ya find the work interesting, do ya?

				WOMAN
		...  What're you talking about?

	A DIRTY BEDROOM

	Carl is humping the escort.

	We hear the door burst open.

	The escort is grabbed and flung out of bed.

				CARL
		Shep!  What the hell are you doing?
		I'm banging that girl!  Shep!  Jesus
		Ch -

	Shep slaps him hard, forehand, backhand.

				SHEP
		Fuck out of my house!

	He hauls him up -

				CARL
		Shep!  Don't you dare fucking hit
		me, man!  Don't you -

	- punches him and flings him away.

	Carl hits a sofa and we see his bare legs disappear as he
	flips back over it.

	Shep enters frame to circle the sofa and kick at Carl behind
	it.

				SHEP
		Fuck outta here.  Put me back in
		Stillwater.  Little fucking shit.

	There is a knock at the door.

				VOICE
		Hey!  Come on in there!

	Shep strides to the door, flings it open.

	A man in boxer shorts stands in the doorway.

				MAN
		C'mon, brother, it's late -  Unghh!

	Shep hits him twice, then grabs both of his ears and starts
	banging his head against the wall.

	The hooker runs by, clutching her clothes, and Shep kicks
	her in the ass as she passes.

	He spins and goes back into the apartment.

	Carl is hopping desperately into his pants.

				CARL
		Stay away from me, man!  Hey!
		Smoke a fuckin' peace pipe, man!
		Don't you dare fuckin' -  Unghh!

	After hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out
	of his dangling pants and strangles him with it.  Carl
	gurgles.  Shep knees Carl repeatedly, then dumps him onto
	the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the
	belt.

	CHAIN RESTAURANT PHONE BOOTH

	Carl listens to the phone ring at the other end.  His face
	is deeply bruised and cut.

	Finally, through the phone...

				VOICE
		...  Yah?

				CARL
		All right, Jerry, I'm through
		fucking around.  You got the
		fucking money?

	JERRY'S KITCHEN

	Jerry is at the kitchen phone.  Through the door to the
	dining room we see Wade picking up an extension.

				JERRY
		Yah, I got the money, but, uh -

				CARL
		Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.
		I want you with this money on the
		Dayton-Radisson parking ramp, top
		level, thirty minutes, and we'll
		wrap this up.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay, but, uh -

				CARL
		You're there in thirty minutes or
		I find you, Jerry, and I shoot
		you, and I shoot your fucking wife,
		and I shoot all your little fucking
		children, and I shoot 'em all in the
		back of their little fucking heads.
		Got it?

				JERRY
		...  Yah, well, you stay away from
		Scotty now -

				CARL
		GOT IT?

				JERRY
		Okay, real good, then.

	The line goes dead.

	A door slams offscreen.

	EXT. HOUSE

	Wade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the
	door and peels out.

	INT. CAR

	Wade's jaw works as he glares out at traffic.  He mumbles to
	himself as he drives.

				WADE
		Okay ... here's your damn money,
		now where's my daughter?...
		Goddamn punk ... where's my damn
		daughter...

	He pulls out a gun, cracks the barrel, peers in.

				WADE
		...  You little punk.

	JERRY'S HOUSE

	Jerry sits in the foyer, trying to pull on pair of galoshes.
	Scotty's voice comes from upstairs:

				VOICE
		...  Dad?

				JERRY
		It's okay, Scotty.

				VOICE
		Where're you going?

				JERRY
		Be back in a minute.  If Stan
		calls you, just tell him I went
		to Embers.  Oh, geez -

	Thunk! - his first boot goes on.

	RADISSON

	Marge sits on the bed in her hotel room, shoes off,
	massaging her feet.  The phone is pressed to her ear, and
	through it, we hear ringing.

				VOICE
		...  Hello?

				MARGE
		Norm?

	MILLE LACS LAKE

	It is late evening, blowing storm.  A leisurely pan across
	the bleak gray expanse finds a little hut in the middle of
	the frozen lake with a pickup truck parked next to it.

				MARGE'S VOICE
		They bitin'?

	INT. HUT

	Norm has a cellular phone to his ear.  His feet are
	stretched out to an electric heater.  The interior is bathed
	in soft orange light.

				NORM
		Yah, okay.  How's the hotel?

				MARGE
		Oh, pretty good.  They bitin'?

				NORM
		Yeah, couple a muskies.  No pike
		yet.  How d'you feel?

				MARGE
		Oh, fine.

				NORM
		Not on your feet too much?

				MARGE
		No, no.

				NORM
		You shouldn't be on your feet too
		much, you got weight you're not
		used too.  How's the food down
		there?

				MARGE
		Had dinner at a place called the
		King's Table.  Buffet style.  It
		was pretty darn good.

				NORM
		Was it reasonable?

				MARGE
		Yah, not too bad.  So it's nice
		up there?

				NORM
		Yah, it's good.  No pike yet, but
		it's good.

	DAYTON-RADISSON RAMP

	The top, open, level.  Snow blows.  A car sits idling.

	Another car pulls onto the roof.  It creeps over to the
	parked car and stops.  It continues to idle as its door
	opens and Wade steps out, carrying the briefcase.

	The door of the other car bangs open and Carl bounces out.

				CARL
		Who the fuck are you?  Who the
		fuck are you?

				WADE
		I got your goddamn money, you
		little punk.  Now where's my
		daughter?

				CARL
		I am through fucking around!  Drop
		that fucking briefcase!

				WADE
		Where's my daughter?

				CARL
		Fuck you, man!  Where's Jerry?  I
		gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -

				WADE
		Where's my damn daughter?  No
		Jean, no money!

				CARL
		Drop that fucking money!

				WADE
		No Jean, no money!

				CARL
		Is this a fucking joke here?

	He pulls out a gun and fires into Wade's gut.

				CARL
		...  Is this a fucking joke?

				WADE
		Unghh ... oh, geez...

	He is on the pavement, clutching at his gut.  Snow swirls.

				CARL
		You fucking imbeciles!

	He bends down next to Wade to pick up the briefcase.

				WADE
		Oh, for Christ ... oh, geez...

	Wade brings out his gun and fires at Carl's head, close by.

				CARL
		Oh!

	Carl stumbles and falls back, and then stands up again.  His
	jaw is gouting blood.

				CARL
		...  Owwmm...

	One hand pressed to his jaw, he fires down at Wade several
	times.  Blood streams through the hand pressed to his jaw.

				CARL
		...  Mmmmmphnck!  He fnkem shop me...

	He pockets the gun, picks up the briefcase one-handed,
	flings it into his car, gets in, peels out.

	DOWN RAMP

	Carl screams down the ramp.  He takes a corner at high speed
	and swerves, just missing Jerry in his Olds on his way to
	the top.

	INT. JERRY'S CAR

	Jerry recovers from the near miss and continues up.

				JERRY
		Oh, geez!

	EXIT BOOTH

	Carl squeals to a halt at the gate, still pressing his hand
	to his bleeding jaw.

				CARL
		Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!

				ATTENDANT
		May I have your ticket, please?

	RAMP ROOF

	Jerry pulls to a halt next to Wade's idling Cadillac.  He
	gets out and walks slowly to Wade's body, prostrate in the
	swirling snow.

				JERRY
		Oh!  Oh, geez!

	He bends down, picks Wade up by the armpits and drags him
	over to the back of the Cadillac.  He drops Wade's body,
	walks to the driver's side of the car, pulls the keys and
	walks back to pop the trunk.  He wrestles Wade's body into
	the trunk, slams it shut and walks back to the scene of the
	shooting.

	He kicks at the snow with his galoshed feet, trying to hide
	the fresh bloodstains.

	EXIT BOOTH

	Jerry approaches in the Cadillac.

	The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away.  The
	booth is empty.

	Jerry eases toward the street, looking over at the booth as
	he passes.

	Inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a
	prostrate body.

	EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE

	The car pulls into the driveway.

	FOYER

	Jerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his
	galoshes.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		...  Dad?

				JERRY
		Yah.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Stan Grossman called.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Twice.

				JERRY
		Okay.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		...  Is everything okay?

				JERRY
		Yah.

	Thoonk - the first boot comes off.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Are you calling Stan?

				JERRY
		Well...  I'm goin' ta bed now.

	CARL'S CAR

	Carl mumbles as he drives, underlit by the dim dash lights,
	one hand now holding a piece of rag to his shredded jaw.

				CARL
		...  Fnnkn ashlzh...  Fnk...

	ROAD

	Carl's car roars into frame, violently swirling the snow.
	Its red tail lights fishtail away.

	FADE OUT

	HOLD IN BLACK

	HARD CUT TO:  BRIGHT - LOOKING THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

	It is a starky sunny day.  We are cruising down a street of
	humble lookalike houses.

	We pan right as we draw toward one house in particular.  In
	its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow.  He
	notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave.

	The driver is Gary, the Brainderd police officer.  He gives
	a finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over.

	OUTSIDE

	Gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel
	in the snow.

				MAN
		How ya doin'?

				GARY
		Mr. Mohra?

				MAN
		Yah.

				GARY
		Officer Olson.

				MAN
		Yah, right-o.

	The two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and
	without standing particularly close.  They stand stiffly,
	arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their
	parka hoods.  Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head
	drawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face
	from protruding into the cold.

				MAN
		...  So, I'm tendin' bar there at
		Ecklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday
		and this little guy's drinkin'
		and he says, 'So where can a guy
		find some action - I'm goin' crazy
		down there at the lake.'  And I
		says, 'What kinda action?' and he
		says, 'Woman action, what do I
		look like,'  And I says 'Well,
		what do I look like, I don't
		arrange that kinda thing,' and he
		says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there
		at the lake' and I says, 'Well,
		this ain't that kinda place.'

				GARY
		Uh-huh.

				MAN
		So he says, 'So I get it, so you
		think I'm some kinda jerk for
		askin',' only he doesn't use the
		word jerk.

				GARY
		I unnerstand.

				MAN
		And then he calls me a jerk and
		says the last guy who thought he
		was a jerk was dead now.  So I
		don't say nothin' and he says, 'What
		do ya think about that?'  So I
		says, 'Well, that don't sound like
		too good a deal for him then.'

				GARY
		Ya got that right.

				MAN
		And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead
		and I don't mean a old age.'  And
		then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin'
		crazy out there at the lake.'

				GARY
		White Bear Lake?

				MAN
		Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's
		closer ta Moose Lake, so I made
		that assumption.

				GARY
		Oh sure.

				MAN
		So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I
		don't think a whole great deal of
		it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the
		homicides out here and she thought
		I should call it in, so I called
		it in.  End a story.

				GARY
		What'd this guy look like anyways?

				MAN
		Oh, he was a little guy, kinda
		funny-lookin'.

				GARY
		Uh-huh - in what way?

				MAN
		Just a general way.

				GARY
		Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr.
		Mohra.  You're right, it's probably
		nothin', but thanks for callin'
		her in.

				MAN
		Oh sure.  They say she's gonna
		turn cold tomorrow.

				GARY
		Yah, got a front movin' in.

				MAN
		Ya got that right.

	CLOSE ON CARL SHOWALTER

	In his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to
	his mangled jaw.  He is staring down at something in the
	front seat next to him.

	His other hand holds open the briefcase.  It has money
	inside - a lot of money.

	Carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and
	looks at it.

				CARL
		...  Mmmnphh.

	He paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling
	for the amount.

				CARL
		...  Jeshush Shrist...  Jeshush
		fuchem Shrist!

	Excited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto
	the back seat.

	He starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer
	pressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to
	his skin by clotted blood.

	He pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow
	again.

	He carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it
	remains adhering to his jaw.

	EXT. CAR

	It is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road.  THe
	door opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase.

	He slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the
	embankment to a barbed-wire fence.  He kneels at one of the
	fence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare
	hands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up.

	He stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his
	red, frozen hands.

	He looks to the right.

	A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
	against unblemished white.

	He looks to the left.

	A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
	against unblemished white.

	He looks at the fence post in front of him.

				CARL
		Mmmphh...

	He looks about the snowy vastness for a marker.  Finding
	none, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to
	scar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up
	against the post.

	He bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it
	against his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car.

	HOTEL ROOM

	Marge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed.
	She is ready to leave, already wearing her parka, but is on
	the phone.

				MARGE
		No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back
		up to Brainerd.

				VOICE
		Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.

				MARGE
		Mm.  But ya think he's all right?
		I saw him last night and he's -

				VOICE
		What'd he say?

				MARGE
		Well, it was nothin' specific
		he said, it just seemd like it
		all hit him really hard, his
		wife dyin' -

				VOICE
		His wife?

				MARGE
		Linda.

				VOICE
		No.

				MARGE
		Linda Cooksey?

				VOICE
		No.  No.  No.  They weren't -
		he, uh, he was bothering Linda
		for about, oh, for a good year.
		Really pestering her, wouldn't
		leave her alone.

				MARGE
		So ... they didn't...

				VOICE
		No.  No.  They never married.
		Mike's had psychiatric problems.

				MARGE
		Oh.  Oh, my.

				VOICE
		Yah, he - he's been struggling.
		He's living with his parents now.

				MARGE
		Oh.  Geez.

				VOICE
		Yah, Linda's fine.  You should
		call her.

				MARGE
		Geez.  Well - geez.  That's a
		suprise.

	MARGE'S CAR

	Marge drives, gazing out at the road.

	MARGE AT A DRIVE-THROUGH

	She leans out of her open window and yells at the order
	panel:

				MARGE
		Hello?

	MARGE AT THE GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich.

	JERRY LUNDEGAARD'S OFFICE

	Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers
	onto a form.  Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper
	and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically
	checks.  The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible
	entries.

	Jerry hums nervously.

	Glass rattles as someone taps at his door.

	Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit
	with worry.

	Marge sticks her head in the door.

				MARGE
		Mr. Lundegaard?  Sorry to bother
		you again.  Can I come in?

	She starts to enter.

				JERRY
		Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda
		busy -

				MARGE
		I unnerstand.  I'll keep it real
		short, then.  I'm on my way out
		of town, but I was just -  Do you
		mind if I sit down?  I'm carrying
		a bit of a load here.

				JERRY
		No, I -

	But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a
	sigh of relieved weight.

				MARGE
		Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you
		about yesterday.  I was just
		wondering -

				JERRY
		Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had
		any vehicles go missing.

				MARGE
		Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean,
		how do you know?  Because, see,
		the crime I'm investigating, the
		perpetrators were driving a car
		with dealer plates.  And they
		called someone who works here, so
		it'd be quite a coincidence if
		they weren't, ya know, connected.

				JERRY
		Yah, I see.

				MARGE
		So how do you - have you done any
		kind of inventory recently?

				JERRY
		The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

				MARGE
		but do you know that for sure
		without -

				JERRY
		Well, I would know.  I'm the
		Executive Sales Manager.

				MARGE
		Yah, but -

				JERRY
		We run a pretty tight ship here.

				MARGE
		I know, but - well, how do you
		establish that, sir?  Are the
		cars, uh, counted daily or what
		kind of -

				JERRY
		Ma'am, I answered your question.

	There is a silent beat.

				MARGE
		...  I'm sorry, sir?

				JERRY
		Ma'am, I answered your question.
		I answered the darn -  I'm
		cooperating here, and I...

				MARGE
		Sir, you have no call to get
		snippy with me.  I'm just doin'
		my job here.

				JERRY
		I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here.
		I'm cooperating...  There's no, uh
		- we're doin' all we can...

	He trails off into silence.

				MARGE
		Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

	Jerry stares at her.

				MARGE
		...  Mr. Lundegaard?

	Jerry explodes:

				JERRY
		Well, heck, if you wanna, if you
		wanna play games here!  I'm
		workin' with ya on this thing, but
		I...

	He is getting angrily off his feet.

				JERRY
		Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!

				MARGE
		Sir?  Right now?

				JERRY
		Sure right now!  You're darned
		tootin'!

	He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door
	and grabbing a pair of galoshes.

				JERRY
		...  If it's so damned imporant
		to ya!

				MARGE
		I'm sorry, sir, I -

	Jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes
	pinched in his hand.

				JERRY
		Aw, what the Christ!

	He stamps out the door.

	Marge stares.

	After a long moment her stare breaks.  She glances idly
	around the office.

	There is a framed picture facing away from her on the
	desktop.  She turns it to face her.  It is Scotty, holding
	an accordion.  There is another picture of Jean.

	Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the
	ceiling.

	She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her.

	She fiddles idly with a pencil.  She pulls a clipboard
	toward her.  It holds a form from the General Motors Finance
	Corporation.

	She looks idly around.  Her look abruptly locks.

				MARGE
		...  Oh, for Pete's sake.

	Jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the
	building.

	Marge's voice is flat with dismay:

				MARGE
		...  Oh, for Pete's sake...

	She grabs the phone and punches in a number.

				MARGE
		...  For Pete's s- he's fleein' the
		interview.  He's feelin' the
		interview...

	Jerry makes a left turn into traffic.

				MARGE
		...  Detective Sibert, please...

	POLICE OFFICER

	We are looking across a steam table at a man in blue.  He
	moves slowly to the right, pushing his tray along a
	cafeteria line.  Behind him, in the depth of the room, is an
	eating area of long Formica tables at which sit a mix of
	uniformed and civilian-clothed police and staff.

	We are listening to an offscreen woman's voice.

				WOMAN
		Well, so far we're just saying he's
		wanted for questioning in connection
		with a triple homicide.  Nobody at
		the dealship there's been much help
		guessing where he might go...

	The woman is entering frame sliding a tray.  Marge enters
	behind her, sliding her own.  We move laterally with them as
	they slowly make their way along the line.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				WOMAN
		We called his house; his little
		boy said he hadn't been there.

				MARGE
		And his wife?

				WOMAN
		She's visiting relatives in Florida.
		Now his boss, this guy Gustafson,
		he's also disappeared.  Nobody at
		his office knows where he is.

				MARGE
		Geez.  Looks like this thing goes
		higher than we thought.  You call
		his home?

				WOMAN
		His wife's in the hospital, has
		been for a couple months.  The big C.

				MARGE
		Oh, my.

				WOMAN
		And this Shep Proudfoot character,
		he's a little darling.  He's now
		wanted for assault and parole
		violation.  He clobbered a neighbor
		of his last night and another
		person who could be one of your perps,
		and he's at large.

				MARGE
		Boy, this thing is really ... geez.

				WOMAN
		Well, they're all out on the wire.
		Well, you know...

				MARGE
		Yah.  Well, I just can't thank you
		enough, Detective Sibert, this
		cooperation has been outstanding.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Ah, well, we haven't had to run
		around like you.  When're you due?

				MARGE
		End a April.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Any others?

				MARGE
		This'll be our first.  We've been
		waiting a long time.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		That's wonderful.  Mm-mm.  It'll
		change your life, a course.

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, I know that!

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		They can really take over, that's
		for sure.

				MARGE
		You have children?

	Detective Sibert pulls an accordion of plastic picture
	sleeves from her purse to show Marge.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		I thought you'd never ask.  The
		older one is Janet, she's nine, and
		the younger one is Morgan.

				MARGE
		Oh, now he's adorable.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		He's three now.  Course, not in that
		picture.

				MARGE
		Oh, he's adorable.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Yah, he -

				MARGE
		Where'd you get him that parka?

	They have reached the end of the cafeteria line.  With a nod
	to the cashier, Detective Sibert indicates hers and Marge's
	trays.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Both of these.

				MARGE
		Oh, no, I can't let you do that.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Oh, don't be silly.

				MARGE
		Well, okay - thank you, Detective.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Oh, don't be silly.

	GAEAR GRIMSRUD

	He sits eating a Swanson's TV dinner from a TV tray he has
	set up in front of an easy chair.

	He watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it
	might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and
	diffused by snow.  The audio crackles with interference.
	Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds
	Grimsrud's complete attention.

	At the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up.

	Carl enters, his face suppurating and raw.

	He reacts to Grimsrud's wordless look with a grotesque
	laugh.

				CARL
		You should she zhe uzher guy!

	He glances around.

				CARL
		...  The fuck happen a her?

	Jean sits slumped in a straight-backed chair facing the
	wall.  Her hooded head, resting on her chin, is motionless.
	There is blood on the facing wall.

				GRIMSRUD
		She started shrieking, you know.

				CARL
		Jezhush.

	He shakes his head.

				CARL
		...  Well, I gotta muddy.

	He is plunking down eight bank-wrapped bundles on the table.

				CARL
		...  All of it.  All eighty gran.
		Forty for you...

	He makes one pile, pockets the rest.

				CARL
		...  Forty for me.  Sho thishuzh
		it.  Adiosh.

	He slaps keys down on the table.

				CARL
		...  You c'n'ave my truck.  I'm
		takin' a Shiera.

				GRIMSRUD
		We split that.

	Carl looks at him.

				CARL
		HOW THE FUCK DO WE SHPLITTA FUCKIN'
		CAR?  Ya dummy!  Widda fuckin'
		chainshaw?

	Grimsrud looks sourly up.  There is a beat.  Finally:

				GRIMSRUD
		One of us pays the other for half.

				CARL
		HOLD ON!  NO FUCKIN' WAY!  YOU
		FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH?  I GOT FUCKIN'
		SHOT INNA FAISH!  I WENT'N GOTTA
		FUCKIN' MONEY!  I GET SHOT FUCKIN'
		PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR
		THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH!  I'M
		TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR!  THAT
		FUCKERZH MINE!

	Carl waits for an argument, but only gets the steady sour
	look.

	Carl pulls out a gun.

				CARL
		...  YOU FUCKIN' ASH-HOLE!  I
		LISHEN A YOUR BULLSHIT FOR A WHOLE
		FUCKIN' WEEK!

	A beat.  Carl returns Grimsrud's stare.

				CARL
		...  Are we shquare?

	Grimsrud says nothing.

				CARL
		...  ARE WE SHQUARE?

	A beat.

	Disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door.

				CARL
		...  Fuckin' ash-hole.  And if
		you shee your friend Shep Proudpfut,
		tell him I'm gonna NAIL hizh
		fuckin' ash.

	OUTSIDE

	We are pulling Carl as he walks toward the car.  Behind him
	we see the cabin door opening.  Carl turns, reacting to the
	sound.

	Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's
	cap, but no overcoat.  He is holding an ax.

	Carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun.

	Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the ax in Carl's neck.

	MARGE

	In her cruiser, on her two-way.  Through it we hear Lou's
	voice, heavily filtered:

				VOICE
		His wife.  This guy says she was
		kidnapped last Wednesday.

				MARGE
		The day of our homicides.

				VOICE
		Yah.

	Marge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through
	the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs
	down to a large frozen lake.

				MARGE
		And this guy is...

				VOICE
		Lundegaard's father-in-law's
		accountant.

				MARGE
		Gustafson's accountant.

				VOICE
		Yah.

				MARGE
		But we still haven't found Gustafson.

				VOICE
			(crackle)
		-  looking.

				MARGE
		Sorry - didn't copy.

				VOICE
		Still missing.  We're looking.

				MARGE
		Copy.  And Lundegaard too.

				VOICE
		Yah.  Where are ya, Margie?

	We hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as
	of a chainsaw or lawnmower.

				MARGE
		Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving
		around Moose Lake.

				VOICE
		Oh.  Gary's loudmouth.

				MARGE
		Yah, the loudmouth.  So the whole
		state has it, Lundegaard and
		Gustafson?

				VOICE
		Yah, it's over the wire, it's
		everywhere, they'll find 'em.

				MARGE
		Copy.

				VOICE
		We've got a -

				MARGE
		There's the car!  There's the car!

	We are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down
	to a cabin.  Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera.

				VOICE
		Whose car?

				MARGE
		My car!  My car!  Tan Ciera!

				VOICE
		Don't go in!  Wait for back-up!

	Marge is straining to look.  The power-tool noise is louder
	here but still muffled, its source not yet visible.

				VOICE
		...  Chief Gunderson?

				MARGE
		Copy.  Yah, send me back-up!

				VOICE
		Yes, ma'am.  Are we the closest PD?

				MARGE
		Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich
		and he takes February off to go to
		Boundary Waters.

	ROAD EXTERIOR

	Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin.
	She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-
	lined hood.

	For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of
	the power tool.  Then, with one curved arm half pressing
	against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly
	steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the
	trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the
	grinding noise.

	She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her
	downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the
	next.

	The roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree,
	her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squints
	down toward the cabin's back lot.

	A tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted
	jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a
	large power tool which his body blocks from view.

	Marge advances.

	The man is forcing downward something which engages the
	roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.

	The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the
	cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams
	as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a
	shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.

	The roar is very loud.

	Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.

	Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we
	can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.

	Marge's eyes shift.

	A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.

	Grimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends
	down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.
	He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.

	Marge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward
	Grimsrud, who is still turned away.

	Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

	Marge closes in, grimacing.

	Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log
	that pushes down into the machine.

	The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of
	Carl Showalter's body.

	Marge has drawn to within twenty yards.  When she bellows it
	sounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the
	roar of the power tool.

				MARGE
		Stop!  Police!  Turn around and
		hands up!

	Startled, Grimsrud scowls.  He turns to face her.

	He stares.

	Marge bellows again:

				MARGE
		...  Hands up!

	Conscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her
	shoulder the armpatch insignia.

				MARGE
		...  Police!

	Grimsrud stares.

	With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at
	Marge and then starts running away.

	Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.

	No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands
	in the snow several feet short of her.

	Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep
	snow.

	Behind him:

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires in the air.

	She lowers the gun and carefully sighs.

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires.

	Grimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss.

	Marge sights again.

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires again.

	Grimsrud pitches forward.  He mutters in Swedish as he
	reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.

	Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand
	reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.

	It comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with
	a snap of the wrist.

				MARGE
		...  All right, buddy.  On your
		belly and your hands clasped
		behind you.

	THE CRUISER

	Marge drives.  Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed
	behind him.

	For a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and
	the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge
	grimly shakes her head.

				MARGE
		...  So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
		in there?

	She glances up in the rear-view mirror.

	Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the
	road.

	Marge shakes her head.

	At length:

				MARGE
		...  I guess that was your
		accomplice in the wood chipper.

	Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is
	motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.

				MARGE
		...  And those three people in
		Brainerd.

	No response.

	Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.

				MARGE
		...  And for what?  For a little
		bit of money.

	We hear distant sirens.

				MARGE
		...  There's more to life than money,
		you know.

	She glances up in the rear-view mirror.

				MARGE
		...  Don't you know that?...  And
		here ya are, and it's a beautiful
		day...

	Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out.

	The sirens are getting louder.  Marge pulls over.

				MARGE
		...  Well...

	She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling
	WHOOPS on her siren.

	She turns on her flashers.

	She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.

	She stares forward, shakes her head.  We hear the dull click
	of her flashers.

				MARGE
		...  I just don't unnerstand it.

	Outside it is snowing.  The sky, the earth, the road - all
	white.

	A squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white.
	It approaches in slow motion.

	An ambulance punches through after it.

	Another squad car.

							 FADE OUT:


	FADE IN:

	HIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL

	It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain.
	One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling
	police cruiser.

	MOTEL ROOM DOORWAY

	We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen
	who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting
	lightly on their holstered sidearms.  One of them raps at
	the door.

				COP ONE
		Mr. Anderson...

	A title fades in:  OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA

	After a pause, muffled through the door:

				VOICE
		...  Who?...

				COP ONE
		Mr. Anderson, is this your burgundy
		88 out here?

				VOICE
		...  Just a sec.

				COP ONE
		Could you open the door, please?

				VOICE
		...  Yah.  Yah, just a sec.

	We hear a clatter from inside.

				VOICE
		...  Just a sec...

	One of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone
	whose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys.
	This man turns a key in the door and then stands away.

	The two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel
	room.

	The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two
	men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns.

	The room is empty.

	Cop one indicates the open bathroom door.

				COP ONE
		Dale!

	The two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the
	ready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace.

	A man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window.

	The policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and
	drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room.

	His flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short,
	piercing screams.

	The cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing
	continues.  The policemen struggle to restrain him.

				COP ONE
		Call an ambulance!

				COP TWO
		You got him okay?

	Cop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts
	into uncontrolled sobbing.

				COP ONE
		Yah, yah, call an ambulance.

	Jerry sobs and screams.

	A BEDROOM

	We are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.

	After a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and
	climbs into bed, with some effort.

				MARGE
		Oooph!

	Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television.

	At length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV.

				NORM
		They announced it.

	Marge looks at him.

				MARGE
		They announced it?

				NORM
		Yah.

	Marge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay
	fixed on the television.

				MARGE
		...  So?

				NORM
		Three-cent stamp.

				MARGE
		Your mallard?

				NORM
		Yah.

				MARGE
		Norm, that's terrific!

	Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure.

				NORM
		It's just the three cent.

				MARGE
		It's terrific!

				NORM
		Hautman's blue-winged teal got the
		twenty-nine cent.  People don't
		much use the three-cent.

				MARGE
		Oh, for Pete's - a course they do!
		Every time they raise the darned
		postage, people need the little
		stamps!

				NORM
		Yah.

				MARGE
		When they're stuck with a bunch a
		the old ones!

				NORM
		Yah, I guess.

				MARGE
		That's terrific.

	Her eyes go back to the TV.

				MARGE
		...  I'm so proud a you, Norm.

	Norm murmurs:

				NORM
		I love you, Margie.

				MARGE
		I love you, Norm.

	Both of them are watching the TV as Norm reaches out to rest
	a hand on top of her stomach.

				NORM
		...  Two more months.

	Marge absently rests her own hand on top of his.

				MARGE
		Two more months.

	Hold; fade out.

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               FADE IN ON:

               EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT

               The sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night 
               air. People stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze. 
               The soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell.

               CLOSE SHOT - A PAIR OF SEXY HIGH HEELS

               and a woman's shapely legs, walking along the wooden pier. 

               OPENING TITLES & CREDITS OVER.

               After several steps, a discarded piece of gum sticks to one 
               of her shoes, stretching out stickily. Two steps later, a 
               piece of paper sticks to the gum, flopping awkwardly with 
               each step.

               The MOVING CAMERA PANS UP her gorgeous legs and sensuous 
               body. She wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer 
               around her soft curves. Her hair is long and blond.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         To some guys, women are like a cheap 
                         puzzle... with pieces that just don't 
                         fit. They think the soul of a woman 
                         is darker than a back alley... more 
                         tangled than a telephone cord... and 
                         colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada. 
                         But those guys don't even have a 
                         clue.

               She stops at the railing. We see an incredibly beautiful 
               face and cool, alluring eyes. This is LOLA CAIN. The term 
               "femme fatale" was coined for her. She's on display... and 
               knows it.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         When you know women the way I do, 
                         you understand exactly what what 
                         makes them tick... what makes them 
                         hum... what makes them jiggle up and 
                         down when they walk. And it's not 
                         the kind of thing you can learn from 
                         a correspondence course.

               The CAMERA MOVES with her as she walks on, passing TWO MEN 
               whose eyes are glued to her. We HOLD ON THEM.

               One is NED RAVINE, in his thirties, stalwart, handsome, hair 
               trimmed neatly, but with a feel of loose ends about him... 
               coat slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up, the sweat 
               dampening his shirt. He's a cop. A plain clothes detective 
               who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost.

               Next to him is ARCH, his partner. Older, if not in years, at 
               least in mileage. Dependable, solid, with no great aspirations 
               except to reach the end of a shift intact. He's eating Nachos 
               from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his 
               fingers.

               The CAMERA PUSHES IN to NED. His eyes are fixed on Lola.

               ANGLE - LOLA - NED'S POV

               She walks to the other side of the pier... as more paper 
               sticks to the gum on her shoe. She stands at the railing.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         There are two kinds of women in this 
                         world... and I've known 'em both.

               ANGLE - ARCH

               Arch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward Ned. The 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE NED. It isn't "voice-over" 
               narration at all. Ned is actually talking out loud.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         One will take you for a fast ride on 
                         a bumpy road with no seat belt. But 
                         the other kind...

                                     ARCH
                              (interrupts)
                         Jeez... knock off the chatter, will 
                         ya.

                                     NED
                         Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.

                         It's true. Women are very complex, 
                         but if you know how to read 'em... 
                         they're an open book. You can always 
                         tell the rotten apples from the 
                         peaches.

               In the b.g., MILO CRUMLEY, the "Support Hose Bandit", ambles 
               by casually, unnoticed, sucking on a cherry Snow-Cone through 
               the panty-hose pulled down over his head.

               He pops the last chip in his mouth, licks his fingers and 
               turns the container over.

               Ned shakes his head. Arch heads off to the Nacho stand. Ned 
               steps over to the railing... gazes out at the ocean.

               A SAXOPHONE begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody... a 
               recurrent tune that will come to be known as LOLA'S THEME.

               A beat later... Lola moves to Ned's side at the railing. He 
               tries to ignore her presence, peering into the darkness. 
               Lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes.

                         Sure.

               Ned pulls out a small flashlight, shines it in her purse. 
               She pulls a cigarette out of the pack, puts it to her lips... 
               her eyes on Ned, sizing him up.

               He pulls out a handful of matchbooks, shows her, then stuffs 
               them back in his pocket.

               He turns and walks along the pier. She falls into step beside 
               him, lighting her own cigarette. A saxophone player named 
               DIZZY follows behind them, continuing to play. He's the actual 
               source of the romantic THEME MUSIC we've been hearing.

               Lola turns to the hot dog VENDOR, raising two fingers.

                         Two dogs. Hot.

               She takes them... hands one to Ned. He picks up the plastic 
               mustard container to put mustard on her hot dog first.

                         Only when I'm in heat.

               Ned REACTS to this, squeezing the container. A stream of 
               mustard squirts out, hitting the front of Lola's dress.

                                     NED
                         Oh! Sorry.

               Flustered, he stuffs his hot dog into his inside jacket 
               pocket, then tries to wipe the mustard off Lola's dress, 
               smearing it all over her, making it worse. She watches him 
               with a cool, detached gaze as he fumbles ingenuously.

               Suddenly, Ned stops, looking off. He sees... Milo Crumley 
               going into the PUBLIC RESTROOM. Ned starts to leave. Lola 
               grabs his hand, holding it tightly against her breast.

               He heads for the men's room... signaling to Arch, who's 
               waiting in line at the Nacho stand. Arch motions at the long 
               line... all UNIFORMED COPS... shrugging helplessly.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM ON PIER - NIGHT

               Several MEN are at the urinals. Milo, still wearing the panty 
               hose over his head, washes his face at the sink. He looks 
               up, sees Ned enter. Ned sees Milo... reacts, pulling the 
               frankfurter out of his pocket and pointing it.

                                     NED
                         Hold it right there, Milo!

               The Men turn, seeing Ned pointing the frankfurter.

                         Look out! He's got a weenie!

               Milo bolts, slamming into Ned, knocking him back through the 
               door of a stall, into the lap of the MAN inside.

               EXT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Milo bursts out, colliding with Arch. They both go down in a 
               flurry of Nacho chips and cheese. Arch helps Milo to his 
               feet, apologizing profusely... picking up the gun that Milo 
               dropped, handing it back to him. Milo sprints off down the 
               pier.

               A beat later, Ned bursts out the door... dashing after Milo.

               ANGLE - ALONG THE PIER

               Milo runs frantically, knocking people aside! He ducks into...

               INT. BUMPER CAR PAVILION - NIGHT

               ...and drags a FLUSTERED MAN out of a bumper car, jumps in, 
               and speeds away!

               A beat later, Ned runs up, followed by Arch. Ned flashes his 
               badge at a FRECKLE-FACED KID in one of the bumper cars.

                                     NED

               He pulls the kid out, jumps in, slaps a portable FLASHING 
               RED LIGHT on the dashboard... then speeds off after Milo, a 
               SIREN WAILING! He zig-zags through the crush of other bumper 
               cars in the pavilion.

               Ned's bumper car catches up with Milo, pulling alongside. 
               Milo turns the wheel, RAMMING Ned! Ned RAMS him back, both 
               bumper cars swerving violently... spraying SPARKS!

               Ned SLAMS Milo's car again! Milo loses control, spins out 
               and SMASHES into the pavillion railing!

               Ned swerves to avoid a collision, but RAMS into two other 
               bumper cars, wrenching to a grinding halt. A BEAT. The AIRBAG 
               inflates in his bumper car.

               Arch runs up as Ned pulls himself from the wreckage. They 
               turn to see Milo leap from his mangled bumper car, leap over 
               the pavillion railing and dash down the pier and into an 
               alley between two buildings. A sign on the building says: 
               DEAD END ALLEY.

               Ned and Arch eye each other, shake their heads, and follow 
               after Milo.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               IN THE ALLEY

               Milo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of the 
               alley and scrambles up the wire mesh. Suddenly, Ned's hand 
               shoots out, grabs Milo's ankle, yanking him down hard.

               Milo jumps to his feet, swinging at Ned, who catches Milo's 
               fist with his hand, stopping it cold... neatly snapping a 
               handcuff on his wrist. He shoves Milo's arm against the fence 
               and snaps the other cuff to the chainlink.

               A SWITCHBLADE flashes out of Milo's other hand with a sharp 
               CLICK! Milo slashes the blade at Ned, just missing his face. 
               On the backswing, Ned parries with his own switchblade and 
               flips Milo's knife away.

               Milo pulls a .45 Calibre REVOLVER with his free hand! Ned 
               shoves his finger into the end of the barrel. Milo looks 
               surprised... then sneers, clicking the hammer back.

               Milo hesitates, unsure. Finally, he releases the gun. Ned 
               raises it up on the end of his finger. Arch pulls it off 
               with a loud POP!

               REVEAL ARCH

               holding up a series of "cue cards"... as Ned reads from them.

                                     NED
                         ...may be used against you in a court

                         Nahhhh!

                                     NED
                         Then today's your lucky day...

               He flips out a business card, handing it to Milo.

               ANGLE - THE BUSINESS CARD

               It reads... "Ned Ravine - Defense Attorney"

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - DAWN

               Large. Expensive. Impressive. The name on the mailbox reads 
               "Ned and Lana Ravine."

               We begin to HEAR the O.S. SOUND of passionate lovemaking!

               INT. HOUSE - DAWN

               The CAMERA MOVES up the stairs, into the bedroom. Still O.S., 
               we hear more heavy breathing... urgent whispers... lust... 
               passion... squeaky bedsprings!

               A trail of clothes is scattered before us on the way to the 
               bed... shoes, a dress, slip, bra, nylons, panties... greasy 
               coveralls with a "Frank Kelbo - Mobile Mechanic" namepatch, 
               dirty work boots, a wrench and a gigantic grease gun...

               The bed shakes violently. A female VOICE calls the shots as 
               various tools drop to the floor.

                                     LANA (O.S.)
                         Oh yes, Frank! Adjust the stroke by 
                         ten percent! That's it.
                              (CLUNK! A wrench)
                         Now tweak my points. Oh yes, oh yes!
                              (THUNK! Pliers)
                         You got it! Stabilize your ball joints 
                         and grind my rear differential!

                         Now accelerate! Floor it! Lay rubber, 
                         baby! VRRROOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!

               A beat. The LIGHT clicks ON. LANA; a sexy redhead with a 
               cool, manipulative edge, and FRANK; a slick, smarmy Lothario, 
               lay under the sheets, panting, glistening with sweat.

               Lana reaches for a pack of "Fatal 100's" on the bedside table.

                                     LANA
                         Not bad for an auto mechanic...

                                     FRANK
                              (grins, cocky)
                         Yeah, well you're not so bad 
                         yourself... for a lawyer's wife...

                                     LANA
                         Better watch your tongue, sweetie, 
                         or I'll have my husband arrest you.

                                     FRANK
                         Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When 
                         does he ever find time for you?

               She lights a cigarette... exhales a soft, gloomy cloud.

                                     LANA
                         He doesn't. That's why I need you to 
                         keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why 
                         drive a jalopy when you can have a 
                         hot rod?

                                     FRANK
                         Maybe you should trade him in on a 
                         new model.

                                     LANA
                         I would... if I could make any money 
                         on the deal.

                                     FRANK
                              (reaches for her)
                         Want to go for another test drive?

               The SOUND of an automobile engine outside. Lana stops him.

                                     LANA
                         Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm 
                         still under warranty.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Ned glances at the white van parked in the driveway, then 
               takes note of his wife's silver Mercedes... sitting on floor 
               jacks, the hood raised, tools spread out around it.

               INT. HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - MORNING

               Ned enters. Lana wears a diaphanous dressing gown, buttoned 
               unevenly, hair disheveled. She smokes a cigarette.

                                     NED
                         Morning sweetheart.

               Ned kisses her on the back of the neck as he passes through 
               the kitchen on his way to the dining room. She reacts with 
               bored, contemptuous disinterest, picking up the coffee pot.

                                     LANA
                         Uh huh. Want some coffee?

               Ned steps back into the kitchen with his briefcase.

                                     NED
                         No thanks.

               Ned sees Frank sitting at the kitchen table, hair messed up, 
               coveralls hastily pulled on inside-out. Frank is reading a 
               copy of INSURANCE DIGEST magazine. A headline on the cover 
               touts an article: "LIFE INSURANCE FOR YOUR CAT!... Cover All 
               Nine Lives For The Price of One!" Ned's smile fades.

                                     LANA
                         Frank here was just grabbing a little 
                         before going back to work on my car.

               He steps over to the table... gives Frank a cool stare.

                                     NED
                         How long you been working on Lana's 
                         Mercedes, Frank?

                                     FRANK
                              (shrugs)
                         Oh... I don't know... six, seven 
                         weeks.

                                     NED
                         And ya still haven't found the 
                         problem?

                                     FRANK
                              (a leering smile)
                         Think I got my finger on it though.

               Ned turns to Lana.

                                     NED
                         I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't 
                         born yesterday. He's not fixing your 
                         car. He's SCREWING you!

               Lana tenses up at this. Frank freezes. He figures they've 
               been busted. He sits there, holding the magazine, not moving 
               a muscle... as Ned turns on him.

                                     NED
                         YOU are screwing my wife! I can see 
                         what your game is, Frank. You open 
                         up her hood, poke around in there... 
                         squirt some lubrication in... play 
                         around with all her parts... then 
                         take an old used piston and stick it 
                         in... then pull it out... in, out, 
                         in, out! Every day! There's no end 
                         to it. You just keep coming and 
                         COMING!... and the bill just gets 
                         bigger and BIGGER!

               Lana braces herself against the sink, breathless... turned 
               on by Ned's description. Ned goes to her, sympathetic.

                                     NED
                         But you don't see it, do you, Lana? 
                         You're too good... too pure. You 
                         can't see the evil in people like 
                         him.
                              (turns to Frank)
                         Well, you're not getting away with 
                         it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're 
                         fired!

                                     LANA
                              (breathless)
                         Ned... don't you have to be somewhere?

                                     NED
                              (checks his watch)
                         Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late 
                         for court.

               He goes to kiss her mouth and she turns her cheek to him. He 
               looks at her lovingly... touches her face tenderly.

                                     NED
                         You are so naive.

               He picks up his briefcase, gives Frank a nasty look, then 
               exits thru the back door.

               Lana and Frank stare at each other lustfully, really hot 
               now! Frank sweeps the dishes off the table with his arm. 
               Lana leaps into his arms, wrapping her legs around his waist. 
               He lays her down on the kitchen table, standing over her.

               Suddenly, Ned opens the back door, glaring right at Frank... 
               not even noticing Lana on the table.

                                     NED
                         Finish your coffee... then GET OUT!

               He slams the door. A beat. Lana and Frank begin to devour 
               each other with passionate kisses. Another beat. The front 
               doorbell RINGS once... then again.

                                     FRANK
                         Who's that?

                                     LANA
                         Just the postman. He always rings 
                         twice.

               INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - DAY

               Richly appointed with stately oak, walls lined with law books. 
               As in all "Noir" thrillers, venetian blinds cast dramatic 
               slashes of light and ceiling fans turn lazily in every room. 
               Ned hurries in, rummaging through the files on his desk.

               LAURA, a strikingly lovely brunette, enters from the outer 
               office, files in hand. She is Ned's astute, dedicated, self-
               sacrificing "girl-friday" and legal secretary. She keeps his 
               life from spinning crazily apart. She absolutely adores him.

                                     NED
                         Laura... do you know where...?

                                     LAURA
                              (hands him file)
                         Right here. The judge decided to 
                         skip arraignment and take Milo direct 
                         to trial. You're six minutes late, 
                         but don't sweat it. You got Judge 
                         Allen. He's always eleven minutes 
                         late.

               She picks up a lawbook, flips it open to a dog-eared page.

                                     LAURA
                         I suggest you try Lemming versus 
                         Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped 
                         in the water and everybody followed.

                                     NED
                              (thinks about it)
                         Yeah. Good idea.

               He smiles gratefully... drops the file into his briefcase.

               Ned heads for the office washroom. Laura darts ahead of him 
               into the washroom and turns the water on.

               Ned steps in... splashes some water on his face. Laura grabs 
               a towel from the rack where three small towels hang neatly... 
               hands it to Ned. He dries his face, looking at her with 
               genuine fondness and gratitude.

                                     NED
                         I don't know what I'd do without 
                         you?

               She glances toward the toilet, notices it hasn't been flushed. 
               She FLUSHES it, lowers the seat.

                                     LAURA
                         Really?

               She sits down on the toilet seat, watching him adoringly as 
               he shaves with an electric razor.

                                     NED
                         Laura, how long have you worked for 
                         me?

                                     LAURA
                         Two years, seven months, twenty-three 
                         days, nineteen hours...
                              (checks her watch)
                         ...six minutes and fifty-two seconds.
                              (softly, to herself)
                         ...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty-
                         five... fifty-six...

                                     NED
                         And when was the last time I gave 
                         you a raise?

               Laura neatly folds the end of the toilet paper into a point.

                                     LAURA
                         Never. But that's okay. I don't need 
                         a raise. In fact... I was thinking 
                         of giving you a rebate on my salary.

               He clicks off the razor, turns to look at her for a long 
               moment, considering this, then...

                                     NED
                         Naw. That's okay. You keep it.

               He gives her a manly pat on the shoulder then casually tosses 
               the towel onto the rack, where it hangs sloppily askew... 
               right next to her face. He exits.

               Laura stares at the towel with a tortured expression. The 
               CAMERA PUSHES IN to her face as we see...

               INT. ULTRA-MODERN BEACH HOUSE - DAY

               Scrawled on a steamed-up bathroom mirror - FLASHBACK - CAPE 
               COD - THREE YEARS EARLIER. A hand wipes the mirror off, 
               revealing Laura... younger, longer hair, with a nasty black 
               eye.

               LAURA'S HUSBAND appears behind her, glaring insanely. He 
               looks toward the towel rack.

               There are three towels... with HIS - HIS - HIS embossed along 
               the bottom edge. One towel hangs longer than the others.

                                     LAURA'S HUSBAND
                         Did we forget something?

               She meekly lines up all the towels.

                                     LAURA'S HUSBAND
                         Did we forget something?

               She meekly lines up all the towels.

               INT. BEACH HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

               Laura's Husband pulls the cupboard open. All the cans and 
               boxes are neatly stacked in straight lines. All except one. 
               She straightens it... trembling with fear.

               EXT. DECK OF BEACH HOUSE - DAY

               He pulls her outside, nodding toward a line of tall PINE 
               trees behind the house. They are all straight and even... 
               except one, whose tall branches tower conspicuously above 
               the rest.

               He holds up a chainsaw, nodding toward the trees. Shaking 
               and tearful... she backs into the house.

               END FLASHBACK

               BACK TO LAURA

               SCREAMING out in terror! Ned rushes in, shaking her.

                                     NED
                         Laura. Laura! What is it?

                                     LAURA
                              (coming out of it)
                         I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a 
                         bit... claustrophobic... in the 
                         bathroom.

                                     NED
                         Maybe we should try some prune juice.

               He gives her shoulder a consoling squeeze, then exits. She 
               shakily straightens the towels and regains her composure.

               Ned opens a wardrobe closet in his office. He walks along, 
               looking at thirty exactly identical blue suits, hanging 
               neatly. Laura follows behind him. He stops and stares, 
               indecisive.

                                     LAURA
                         Wear the blue one.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Ned turns dramatically to face the jury.

                                     NED
                         Ladies and gentlemen... I ask you... 
                         does this look like the face of a 
                         crook?

               ANGLE - MILO CRUMLEY

               sitting next to Laura at the defense table... STILL wearing 
               the panty hose over his head.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     NED
                         Of course it does. But the question 
                         of my client's guilt or innocence is 
                         not the issue here today. I'm certain 
                         every member of the jury can clearly 
                         see that he's guilty!

                                     BLIND JUROR
                         I can't.

               ANGLE ON NED - JURY'S POV

               Ned ignores this, turning to look directly at the CAMERA as 
               he addresses the jury... holding up a pair of nylon pantyhose.

                                     NED
                         Put yourself in his shoes. Look 
                         through his eyes. See the world the 
                         way HE sees it!

               He puts the pantyhose over the LENS, obscuring our view.

                                     NED
                         Things just don't look the same. 
                         It's fuzzy... and frightening!

               NEW ANGLE - TO INCLUDE NED AND JURY

               The nylon pantyhose are draped over the frightened face of a 
               WOMAN JUROR. All the other Jurors are holding up their own 
               socks and nylon stockings, trying to peer through them.

               Ned steps over to Milo, motioning toward him.

                                     NED
                         Ladies and gentlemen... Milo Crumley 
                         is not the perpetrator here. He is 
                         the VICTIM!

               Milo unwraps a piece of bubble gum and pushes it into his 
               panty-hose covered mouth, chewing the nylon and gum together.

                                     NED
                         Like ALL of us... this man is the 
                         unfortunate victim of these tragically 
                         difficult economic times. And what 
                         does that mean? He can't support his 
                         family!

               Ned motions toward the gallery, where we SEE...

               ...MILO'S WIFE and TWO CHILDREN, all wearing panty hose over 
               their faces. Ned motions toward Milo.

                                     NED
                         For God's sake!... He can't even 
                         support his own FACE!

               JUDGE ALLEN notices that Milo is chewing gum.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         Mr. Crumley... you cannot chew gum 
                         in my courtroom... unless you have 
                         enough for everyone.

               Milo holds up a big plastic bag filled with bubble gum. Judge 
               Allen grabs it, takes a piece of gum and hands it to the 
               Bailiff.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         Bailiff. Pass these out.

               The Bailiff takes the bag, offers one to Ned... who takes a 
               piece, unwraps it and starts chewing. The Bailiff then 
               proceeds to pass out gum to EVERYONE in the courtroom.

               The JURY FOREMAN raises his hand and clears his throat.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         And don't forget the jury.

                                     NED
                         And so, desperate and broke, with no 
                         other options before him, Mr. Crumley 
                         went to eleven Savings & Loans and 
                         did what any of you would have done. 
                         He stole back the money that the 
                         S&Ls had stolen from him!

               The courtroom erupts in CHEERS! Judge Allen raps the gavel.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                              (interrupting)
                         Mr. Ravine... please approach the 
                         bench.

               He does. The Judge leans toward him, reaching out to cover 
               the microphone, covering the end of the gavel instead. The 
               Judge's voice is AMPLIFIED over the courtroom speakers.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         You're not running for congress here, 
                         so knock off the speeches and quit 
                         inciting these brainless morons! Now 
                         pick up the pace and wrap this son-
                         of-a-bitch up! Call your first 
                         witness.

               Ned turns... looking out over the courtroom.

                                     NED
                         I call... Detective Ned Ravine.

               There is a surprised GASP from the crowd... and a loud MURMUR.

               The BAILIFF holds out a video box. It's titled HOLY BIBLE - 
               THE VIDEO. Ned puts one hand on it, raises the other.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Do you swear to tell the truth, the 
                         whole truth and nothing but the truth, 
                         so help you God?

                                     NED
                         I do.

               Ned sits down... then gets up, his demeanor changing.

                                     NED
                         Detective Ravine, at the time of the 
                         arrest, did you read the defendant 
                         his Miranda rights?

               He slips back into the witness box.

                                     NED
                         Of course. That's standard procedure.

               Ned steps over to Arch, who is sitting in the first row of 
               the gallery. Arch hands him the Miranda "cue cards."

                                     NED
                         Are these the cards Officer Brooks 
                         used to prompt you while reading Mr. 
                         Crumley his rights?

               He lays them on the corner of the stand... then slips into 
               the chair. He picks the cards up and flips thru them. On the 
               back we can see scribbled... "NED'S IDIOT CARDS"

                                     NED
                         Yeah. These are them.

               Ned jumps to his feet, pacing dramatically, grabbing the 
               cards.

                                     NED
                         Reading from the cards now... quote 
                         "You have the right to remain silent, 
                         if you waive that right, anything 
                         you say... may be used against you 
                         in a court of law." Is that right?

                                     NED
                              (back in the chair)
                         That's right.

                                     NED
                              (stands up, announces)
                         WRONG! The official Miranda warning 
                         is... "anything you say CAN be used 
                         against you in a court of law." Not 
                         "may"... "CAN!"
                              (on the attack)
                         Don't you know the difference between 
                         "can" and "may", Detective? Every 
                         school kid knows "can" is a verb 
                         that indicates ability to perform, 
                         while "may" is a verbal auxiliary 
                         indicating the permission to act.

               Ned pivots into the witness stand, changing his attitude 
               from aggressive attorney to defensive, angry witness as he 
               hits the chair.

                                     NED
                         I didn't have time to worry about 
                         past participles or interrogative 
                         pronouns! I was trying to protect 
                         society from a deranged MADMAN!
                              (leaps up, pointing)
                         But this ivy league fop...!!!

               The courtroom ERUPTS! The Judge bangs the gavel. Ned strides 
               proudly toward the defense table.

                                     NED
                         I have no more use for this witness.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         Mr. Ravine...

               Ned turns. The Judge motions with a finger for Ned to approach 
               the bench. Ned does, resting his hand on it.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         I'm dismissing this case on the 
                         grounds of improper grammar.

               The Judge smacks Ned's hand with a ruler!

                                     NED
                         Ow!

                                     PROSECUTOR
                              (jumps up)
                         But your Honor...!

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         I know, I know. It's a technicality. 
                         But it's the kind of technicality 
                         that makes the American legal system 
                         what it is today! Court's adjourned!

               The Judge mistakenly picks up the microphone and whacks it 
               on the bench like a gavel. BAM! BAM! BAM! It is DEAFENING! 
               Everyone covers their ears in pain.

               The THX Sound System Logo appears at the bottom of the 
               screen... along with "The Courtroom Is Listening"

               INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Ned turns the key... enters through the private door. He 
               HEARS the plaintive sound of a saxophone playing Lola's 
               Theme... his eyes drawn to the slightly opened door to the 
               outer office.

               ANGLE - NED'S POV THRU OPENING

               A gorgeous pair of legs, sleek nylons, high-heeled shoes.

               There are several CANDY WRAPPERS, CIGARETTE BUTTS and other 
               pieces of TRASH stuck to the bottom of one shoe.

               NED

               pushes the door open. It's Lola. She wears a tight white 
               dress, long white gloves and broad-brimmed hat. The hat tips 
               up slowly, revealing her eyes.

                                     LOLA
                         I waited. You never came back.

               Ned reaches in his pocket, pulls out a wet paper towel.

                                     NED
                         I got busy. Here's that paper towel 
                         I promised.

                                     LOLA
                         Thanks...

                                     NED
                         How'd you get in? The door was locked.

               Lola proudly holds up a tiny bobbie pin. She smiles.

                                     LOLA
                         It's miraculous what a real woman 
                         can do... with a bobbie pin.

               Ned looks at the door. The frame and lock have been brutally 
               chewed away, as if someone used a jackhammer on them! She 
               pulls out a pack of cigarettes... BLACK LUNG LITES.

                                     LOLA
                              (offering)
                         Cigarette?

                                     NED
                         No... thanks. They're bad for ya.

               He goes to the water cooler. She lights up, exhaling a soft 
               cloud of smoke through a sleepy smile, her voice purring.

                                     LOLA
                         Yes, I know. I like things that are 
                         bad for me.
                              (touching lawbooks)
                         So... I hear you go both ways.

               Ned hesitates... about to drink from the paper cup.

                                     NED
                         Only once. It was a fraternity prank. 
                         I never saw him again.

               He gulps the water down, crumbles the cup in his hand.

                                     LOLA
                         No, I mean... you're a cop and a 
                         lawyer.

                                     NED
                         Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of 
                         scum out there on the streets... but 
                         they all deserve a fair and costly 
                         trial.

               Ned turns, tries to casually "dunk" the crumpled cup in the 
               waste basket. He misses.

               Laura enters with a huge pile of lawbooks in her arms. She 
               sees Ned miss the basket and darts over as he bends down to 
               pick it up.

                                     LAURA
                         I'll get that.

               She picks it up and tosses it into the waste basket.

                                     NED
                         Oh... Laura... this is, uh...

                                     LOLA
                         Lola Cain.

               Laura sets the heavy load of books on the desk and steps 
               toward Lola, extending her hand. Lola takes her time removing 
               the long white glove... finally reaching out and shaking 
               Laura's hand with a condescending air.

                                     LOLA
                              (sarcastic)
                         So lovely to meet you, Laura.

               Ned grabs the books and turns to the bookshelf, replacing 
               each lawbook in its proper slot.

               The "handshake" between Lola and Laura turns tense, then 
               aggressive, eventually becoming a "standing Indian wrestle" 
               as they try to force each other off balance with sheer force. 
               Ned is oblivious to the battle behind him, chattering away.

                                     NED
                         Gotta keep these darn books in their 
                         right place or we'll never find the 
                         ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M... 
                         R thru B... W thru F...

               Laura suddenly whirls Lola around, putting her in an arm 
               lock. But Lola elbows Laura in the stomach! Laura doubles 
               over. Lola feigns sympathy, taking her hand... then spins, 
               twisting Laura's arm, flipping her head over heels!

               Laura lands on the couch... upside down... gasping. Lola 
               strikes a haughty pose, still holding her lit cigarette. She 
               takes a drag. Laura checks her watch, then tumbles off the 
               couch, landing on her feet. She straightens her skirt.

                                     LAURA
                         It's getting late. I'll give you a 
                         ride home, Ned.

               Finished with the books, Ned turns... smiles.

                                     NED
                         I have my car.

                                     LAURA
                         I'll tow you.

                                     NED
                         Not today. You don't need to wait. 
                         I'll see you tomorrow.

               Lola looks at Laura... icy, haughty, triumphant. Laura moves 
               reluctantly toward the door, sees the lock and door frame 
               chewed to pieces... whirls around, heads back toward Ned.

                                     LAURA
                         I should call someone to fix this...

                                     NED
                         Tomorrow...

               She instantly spins around, heads back toward the door...

                                     LAURA
                         I'll call from home.

               ...and exits. Ned sits down on the corner of the desk. Lola 
               sits in the chair across from him.

                                     LOLA
                         I think I should warn you, Mr. 
                         Ravine... I'm not wearing any 
                         underwear.

               She crosses her legs suggestively... then slowly, enticingly, 
               re-crosses them in the other direction.

               Unimpressed, Ned opens Laura's desk drawer... pulls a pair 
               of sexy lace panties from a Kleenex-style dispenser box 
               labeled "PANDORA'S POP-UP PANTIES"... which pulls another 
               pair up into position. He tosses the panties to Lola.

                                     NED
                         Try these on.

               She does... very, very slowly and seductively... as they 
               talk.

                                     NED
                         So... what can I do for you?

                                     LOLA
                         I've run across some... papers... 
                         and I thought you might be able to 
                         tell me what they are. You see, I'm 
                         not very experienced when it comes 
                         to... papers.

                                     NED
                         I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able. 
                         Do you have the... papers... here?

                                     LOLA
                         No... they're at home. I thought you 
                         might stop by...

                                     NED
                         I'm on duty tonight.

                                     LOLA
                         Don't they ever give you a night 
                         off?

                                     NED
                         Yeah. Tomorrow.

                                     LOLA
                              (picks up cigarette)
                         Why don't we meet tomorrow evening 
                         then?

               She finishes pulling the panties on with a sultry smile... 
               "snapping" the elastic waistband. She goes to the door, 
               pauses... turns to him.

                                     LOLA
                         I'll let you know where.

                                     NED
                              (steps over to her)
                         What's wrong with my office?

               She looks around, exhaling another cloud of smoke.

                                     LOLA
                         Nothing a good interior decorator 
                         couldn't fix.

               She opens the door. Behind her, in the hall, we see Dizzy, 
               the saxophone player, wailing away on "Lola's Theme."

               CLOSE ON LOLA

               She takes a final, long drag on her cigarette, then reaches 
               O.S. with it... toward Ned.

                                     LOLA
                         Take care of this for me, will ya?

               With a sultry smile, she turns and leaves, closing the door.

               ANGLE ON NED

               The cigarette is stuck in his nose.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The front door swings open. Frank is standing there, dressed 
               in a cheap, loose-fitting suit and a T-shirt.

                                     FRANK
                         I came back for my shower cap.

               Lana, now wearing the diaphanous gown, pulls him inside. She 
               kisses him hungrily, slipping a frilly plastic shower cap 
               with a gaudy floral design on his head.

                                     LANA
                         Yeah, well you came to the right 
                         place.

               She walks to the living room. Frank follows, still wearing 
               the shower cap. Lana snaps her fingers.

                                     LANA
                         Sit down.

               He sits in a chair, looking around.

                                     FRANK
                         Where is he?

                                     LANA
                         On duty all night. By the time he 
                         wraps up his reports, it'll be close 
                         to noon tomorrow.

               She sits on the couch, picks up a stack of papers.

                                     LANA
                         I was just reading over...

               She looks up at Frank. Sees the shower cap.

                                     LANA
                         Take off the hat, Frank.

               He slips the shower cap off as Lana continues.

                                     LANA
                         I was just reading over my husband's 
                         insurance policies. You wouldn't 
                         know anything about insurance, would 
                         you, Frankie?

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies 
                         part-time. I got half a brain... or 
                         didn't you notice?

                                     LANA
                         I musta had my eye on something else.
                              (hands him papers)
                         How about a translation.

               He flips through, scanning the pages, shrugging.

                                     FRANK
                         Standard accident policy... all the 
                         usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The 
                         face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three 
                         million bucks!
                              (flips page)
                         And there's a triple indemnity rider.

                                     LANA
                         Meaning?

                                     FRANK
                         Aw, it's just something agents throw 
                         in so we can boost the premium. If 
                         the policy holder dies under very 
                         specific conditions, it pays off 
                         three times the face value of the 
                         policy.

                                     LANA
                         Nine million dollars...?

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the 
                         company. Nobody ever collects.

                                     LANA
                         Why not?

                                     FRANK
                         Well, like here... it only pays off 
                         if he's shot with a pistol, falls 
                         from a moving northbound train and 
                         drowns in a fresh water stream.

                                     LANA
                         All three?

                                     FRANK
                         See what I mean, sweetheart? What 
                         are the odds of that?

                                     LANA
                         It could happen.
                              (dramatic beat)
                         Suppose it did happen?

                                     FRANK
                         Then you'd be rich.

                                     LANA
                         Then we'd be rich.

                                     FRANK
                         What're you sayin'...?

               She drops to her knees in front of him, her face close to 
               his, speaking with a persuasive urgency.

                                     LANA
                         We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch! 
                         And I know exactly how! He has a 
                         legal symposium in Santa Barbara 
                         this weekend... All we have to do is 
                         get him to take the train up instead 
                         of driving.

                                     FRANK
                         How we gonna do that? Didn't you 
                         tell me he hates trains?

                                     LANA
                         That's where you come in, baby. You're 
                         gonna rig his car so it doesn't work. 
                         That should be no problem for you.

               She gets up, walks to the adjoining room... snapping her 
               fingers at her side. He follows.

               She steps to a table, pulls the cover off an elaborate scale-
               model of Dealey Plaza and a train station, complete with HO-
               Scale model trains chugging around the tracks.

               She uses a pointer to trace the route to the depot.

                                     LANA
                         Then... we give him a lift to the 
                         train station... through Dealey Plaza, 
                         past the Book Suppository and around 
                         the grassy knoll...

                                     FRANK
                         Isn't that out of our way?

               Ignoring this, she turns the LIGHTS OFF, walks over to a 
               screen and picks up a remote control. She clicks the button. 
               A SLIDE PROJECTOR comes on, throwing an IMAGE on Frank's 
               back. We can read the words: THE PLAN.

                                     LANA
                         Move, Frank.

               He moves over. "THE PLAN" appears on the screen.

                                     LANA
                         And pay attention.

               As she talks, IMAGES appear on the screen, accompanying her 
               rapid spiel. We see: a shot of the depot, a map of the rail 
               route, a gun, a river, a Bingo game, baseball action and a 
               huge dollar sign!

                                     LANA
                         Ten minutes out of the station he'll 
                         be standing in the vestibule between 
                         cars... trying to avoid a panic 
                         attack. Fourteen minutes and ten 
                         seconds out, the train crosses the 
                         Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen 
                         minutes and fifty-four seconds, I 
                         shoot him, shove him out the door... 
                         he hits the river and drowns. Bingo! 
                         A triple play. We're rich!

               The lights click ON.

                                     FRANK
                         You been thinking about this a lot, 
                         haven't you?

                                     LANA
                         No. It just came to me.
                              (closer, seductive)
                         I had this image of a big, powerful, 
                         throbbing train... plunging into a 
                         long, dark, wet tunnel.

               They embrace, kissing passionately, dropping out of frame. 
               The model train CHUGS faster, the train whistle SHRIEKING a 
               long "Woooooooo-woooooooooo!"... racing into a model tunnel.

               INT. POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

               Ned and Arch drag in a bunch of bad-ass, multi-ethnic GANG 
               MEMBERS they've just busted. Ned angrily shoves one of the 
               toughest gang members against the wall... losing his cool.

                                     NED
                         Stand over there and shut up!

                                     GANG MEMBER #1
                         Hey, man, we got rights! Don't you 
                         be layin' no deleterious malfeasance 
                         on us.

               Ned goes ballistic and slams him into the wall again!

                                     NED
                         Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want 
                         to hear language like that!

               Arch grabs Ned by the shoulder, pulling him back, calming 
               him.

                                     ARCH
                         Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy. 
                         You seem a little tense tonight. 
                         What is it?

               Ned regains his composure. He's depressed.

                                     NED
                         Aw... I don't know. I guess it's 
                         Lana. It's just... I know she wants 
                         to have a baby so bad...

               Gang Member #1 steps closer, listening.

                                     NED
                         ...but I never get to spend any time 
                         with her. And when I am home... it's 
                         like she's, you know... avoiding 
                         sex.

               Gang Member #1 steps closer, listening.

                                     GANG MEMBER #1
                         You should try to be more sensitive, 
                         man. More romantic. Bring her flowers.

               He steps between them, putting his arm around Ned's shoulder.

                                     GANG MEMBER #1
                         Try to understand how she feels. 
                         After all...

               He steps back, begins to SING "Try A Little Tenderness"...

                                     GANG MEMBER #1
                         She may be weary... Women do get 
                         weary... Wearing that same old shabby 
                         dress... But when she's weary... Try 
                         a little ten-der-ness...

               The other Gang Members join in on the SECOND VERSE with a 
               sweet, mellow street-corner harmony as back-up... and some 
               smooth group choreography.

               The COPS on duty listen raptly, getting maudlin and dewey-
               eyed. Tears roll down the cheeks of the BOOKING SERGEANT.

               The lights dim. A big, gruff COP makes eyes at a HOOKER being 
               booked... and they start to slow dance.

               Arch watches all this with a sentimental smile, munching on 
               his Nachos. When the song ends, Arch puts a comforting hand, 
               covered with Nacho cheese, on Ned's shoulder.

                                     NED
                         That can't be it. I'm the tenderest 
                         guy on the force. Nah... I think 
                         she's just afraid she won't be able 
                         to get pregnant.

                                     ARCH
                         What's to be afraid! It's like making 
                         breakfast! You bring home the bacon... 
                         she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it 
                         up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got 
                         an omelette in the oven!
                              (a beat, then)
                         Why don't you knock off early... go 
                         home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake 
                         up in the morning and find you there 
                         for a change.

                                     NED
                         Naw... I can't. I got all this 
                         paperwork.

                                     ARCH
                         Don't worry about that.

                                     GANG MEMBER #1
                         We'll do our own paperwork, man!

                                     OTHER GANG MEMBERS
                         Yeah! We'll fill out all that shit.

               Ned nods, smiles and gratefully "high-fives" the Gang Members 
               as he heads for the door.

               INT. THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

               The house is dark. A key turns in the lock and Ned enters.

               IN THE BEDROOM

               It's dark. Ned quietly undresses and slips into bed.

               INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON LANA - DAWN

               Sunlight creeps through the windows. Lana's eyes flutter 
               open. She sees Ned beside her... sleeping. Suddenly, it hits 
               her. She turns! Frank is on the other side, curled up, 
               snoring. She's laying between both men!

               Lana elbows Frank. He stirs, groggy. She covers his mouth... 
               indicating Ned. Frank's eyes bug out! He slips out of bed. 
               The bed frame SQUEAKS LOUDLY! Frank freezes. Ned sleeps on 
               steadily.

               Frank grabs his clothes. An unending torrent of coins fall 
               out of his pants pockets, CLANGING on the floor! He freezes. 
               Ned sleeps on. Frank retrieves the coins, clumsily stepping 
               on the TV REMOTE CONTROL.

               A high-tech, sleekly designed TELEVISION MONITOR rises up... 
               clicks ON. Frank tries frantically to push the set down, but 
               it keeps rising into position. An IMAGE appears. It's WILLARD 
               SCOTT, doing the weather on the TODAY SHOW.

               Frank grabs the remote control, frantically pounding on all 
               the buttons. The VOLUME goes up... SOUND BLASTING!

                                     WILLARD SCOTT
                              (on television)
                         ...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of 
                         Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and 
                         thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of 
                         female! Smokes three cigars a day, 
                         drinks a straight shot of vodka at 
                         bedtime... and still has sex!

               The alarm clock goes off, CLANGING LOUDLY! Lana dives for 
               it, slamming her hand down, killing the alarm.

               Going for a double-play, she flings the clock at the TV, 
               nailing the on/off switch! Silence. Ned is still out cold.

               Frank moves toward the door... but with each step the floor 
               CREAKS LOUDLY! He turns the knob. It CLUNKS! He pulls the 
               door open v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y and it CRE-E-E-E-A-K-S like 
               the piercing metal brakes of a train!

               He blows Lana a kiss, then pulls the door closed very gently. 
               It sticks. He pulls harder. The knob pops off in his hand 
               and he falls backward, tumbling down the stairs with a HUGE 
               RACKET! Ned doesn't stir. Finally it's SILENT. Lana exhales.

               A SMALL BIRD lands on the sill of the open window, trilling 
               a sweet little "CHIRP." Ned sits bolt upright, irritated.

                                     NED
                         Damn birds!

               He grabs his shoe, heaving it toward the open window.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Frank glances back up at the bedroom window with an arrogant 
               smirk. WHAP! Ned's shoe hits him right in the face!

               EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

               Ned comes down the courthouse steps. He pauses in the street, 
               glimpsing the back of a WOMAN passing nearby... a STUNNING 
               BLOND decked out in a clinging dress and fashionable hat... 
               a long strip of toilet paper trailing from her high heel 
               shoe. It must be LOLA. He turns to watch her.

               A HORN BLARES! BRAKES SCREECH! The SOUND OVERLAPS to...

               INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - DAY

               The door opens. Ned enters, looking terrible. Suit ripped, 
               hair messed up, bruised and battered, briefcase crushed.

                                     LAURA
                         My God, Ned... you look like you 
                         were hit by a bus.

                                     NED
                         I was.
                              (notices)
                         Who's in my office?

                                     LAURA
                         Max Shady's mother.

                                     NED
                         Not again.

               INSIDE THE OFFICE

               MRS. SHADY, an older woman with a pleasant appearance, sits 
               in an overstuffed leather chair. Ned and Laura enter.

                                     NED
                         Hello, Mrs. Shady.

               Ned goes straight to his office closet, pulls out an identical 
               blue suit... and starts stripping off his tattered clothes.

                                     NED
                         Laura... check on my insurance. Make 
                         sure it's paid up.

               Laura reluctantly returns to the outer office.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max, 
                         is getting out of prison tomorrow.

                                     NED
                              (checks his watch)
                         Gee, has it been seven years already?

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Seven long, miserable years in the 
                         slammer. And he's a bit pissed off.

                                     NED
                         Well, being locked in a tiny room 
                         with no TV can make a guy feel pretty 
                         tense.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         I'm very concerned about him, Mr. 
                         Ravine. He said you were a two-bit 
                         shyster... and he's going to rip 
                         your head off and use it for a bowling 
                         ball!

               He goes to her, putting a comforting hand on her shoulder, 
               looking her right in the eye, attempting to provide solace.

                                     NED
                         I'm sure the experience wasn't all 
                         negative. He probably made a lot of 
                         friends...

                                     MRS. SHADY
                              (ever hopeful)
                         You think?

                                     NED
                         ...learned a useful trade...

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Oh yes... live autopsies...

                                     NED
                         ...caught up on all those books he 
                         wanted to read...

               She struggles to her feet feebly...

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Maybe so... but he said he's going 
                         to punch you in the testicles...

               She hauls off and PUNCHES him like a pile driver! WHAM! He 
               doubles over, gasping.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         ...smash your face...

               She KNEES him in the face, raising him up... then nails him 
               with a devastating RIGHT CROSS, spinning him around. He 
               collapses over the desk.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         ...and decimate your wardrobe.

               She grabs the tail of his suit jacket and rips it up the 
               back!

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         And I wouldn't want that to happen.
                              (spanks his butt)
                         He's a naughty naughty boy. I just 
                         thought I should warn you.

               She turns and shuffles out, passing through the outer office.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                              (to Laura)
                         Bye for now.
                              (pauses by desk)
                         Oh... may I have a cookie?

                                     LAURA
                              (at file cabinet)
                         Sure.

               She grabs a handful of cookies and casually flings them at 
               Laura... as she heads out the door.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Thank yooooooooou.

               Laura rushes into Ned's office with the file folder. He 
               staggers unsteadily by the desk.

                                     LAURA
                         Oh my God, Ned.

                                     NED
                         I hate when she comes to see me.

                                     LAURA
                         Don't you realize, Ned?... you could 
                         be in real danger.

                                     NED
                              (sees file)
                         What's that?

                                     LAURA
                         Extreme peril. You know, the risk of 
                         personal bodily harm.

                                     NED
                              (points at file)
                         No... I mean that.

                                     LAURA
                         Your insurance file. But the policy's 
                         missing. Did you take it home?

                                     NED
                         I don't think so.

               Laura looks puzzled... wondering where it might be. Then...

                                     LAURA
                         Oh, wait a second...

               She goes to her desk in the outer office, digs through a 
               drawer. Suddenly, she GASPS!

               She is holding...

               A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH

               of her abusive HUSBAND... sneering. A circle has been drawn 
               around his head with lipstick and a diagonal line slashed 
               across his face.

               MATCH DISSOLVE TO: FLASHBACK

               HER HUSBAND'S FACE

               peers out through a sailboat porthole at stormy seas. A piece 
               of masking tape stuck to the glass matches the diagonal line.

               INT. CABIN OF SAILBOAT - NIGHT

               Laura's Husband turns from the porthole. Laura cowers.

               The boat pitches and heaves, disturbing all the neatly hung 
               towels, emblazoned with MINE - MINE - MINE across the bottom 
               edge. Laura's Husband reacts with a crazed look in his eyes.

               Laura makes a break for it, running up on deck.

               EXT. SAILBOAT IN STORM - NIGHT

               Laura's Husband scrambles up onto the deck, looking fore and 
               aft. Laura's vanished! He looks out to sea, calling...

                                     LAURA'S HUSBAND
                         Lau-raaaaa!

               EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

               Laura paddles ashore, grasping a little kid's inflatable 
               float ring. She struggles onto the sand and looks out to 
               sea, triumphant... tossing the plastic float aside.

               MONTAGE - ULTRA CONTEMPO BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

               -- Laura rushes in, tracking water all through the house.

               -- Laura cuts an inch of hair from her amazingly long, very 
               wet tresses, then puts on a WIG... that is also LONG and 
               WET!

               -- Laura retrieves a bra and a package of Twinkies from a 
               secret hiding place... and stuffs them into a small brown 
               paper bag.

               -- Laura hurriedly mops up her water tracks, then...

               -- She uses an industrial buffer to wax the hardwood floor.

               -- Laura removes her wedding ring... throws it in the toilet. 
               She reaches for the handle to flush it... hesitates, seeing 
               the "CONSERVE WATER - THIS MEANS YOU!" sticker on the toilet. 
               She reaches into the bowl and retrieves the ring.

               -- On the deck, Laura throws the wedding ring toward the 
               ocean. A SEAGULL swoops down, snatching it in mid-air and 
               flies off.

               OMIT

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               -- In the bathroom... the Seagull flies in through the open 
               window, lands on the back of the toilet and drops the ring... 
               into the toilet bowl!

               EXT. THE BEACH - NEXT MORNING

               Laura's Husband reaches into the surf and picks up the 
               deflated float ring. He looks at it with a cruel sneer.

               INT. BEACH HOUSE - BATHROOM

               Laura's Husband fishes Laura's wedding ring out of the toilet 
               bowl... looking off with demonic rage!

               END FLASHBACK MONTAGE

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK

               from Laura's SCREAMING mouth! Her eyes are filled with pure 
               terror! A GIGANTIC wave of WATER splashes in her face!

               We see Ned... holding a tiny empty paper cup in his hand. 
               Laura is completely drenched!

                                     NED
                         Laura! Are you alright? That was a 
                         very long flashback you had.

               She snaps out of it, sputtering.

                                     LAURA
                         Yes... I know. It's okay. I'm just a 
                         little... pre-menstrual.

               She goes to her desk, still upset. She picks up the message 
               spike and turns to Ned.

                                     LAURA
                         That Lola Cain... "person"... stopped 
                         by. She left this!

               She thrusts it toward Ned's face! There's a business card 
               stuck on the end. He pulls it off.

               ANGLE - CLOSE ON BUSINESS CARD

               It reads: LE HOT CLUB! No Air Conditioning... And Proud Of 
               It! Scribbled next to it is the message... "Meet me at 7:30". 
               The edges of the card are scorched.

               INT. LE HOT CLUB - NIGHT

               It's dark, seductive, smoky, crowded... and HOT. Everybody 
               is dripping with sweat and holding unlit cigarettes.

               Ned enters, sees Lola sitting on a stool at the bar, one leg 
               crossed provocatively over the other. A beer can is stuck to 
               the gum on the bottom of her shoe. It falls off with a CLUNK.

               He sits on the stool next to her. She looks at him, smiles.

                                     NED
                         Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked 
                         me to take care of this.

               He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a LIT CIGARETTE. 
               It has a very long ash.

                                     LOLA
                         Thanks...

               She takes it... inhales a drag, then lets the smoke flow out 
               through her smile. It flows out for a loooooooooong time! 
               More smoke than she could ever have inhaled. Then...

                                     NED
                         You smoke too much.
                              (looks around, then)
                         It's hot tonight.

                                     LOLA
                         Is it? I never know. My body heat 
                         runs about twenty degrees above 
                         normal.

               He notices the drink in her hand is BOILING. A saxophone 
               begins to softly wail Lola's Theme. Ned looks over to see a 
               QUARTET, featuring Dizzy on sax. The GUITARIST spontaneously 
               bursts into FLAME! A FIREMAN, in full gear, jumps up from 
               the bar and puts out the blaze with a fire extinguisher. 
               None of the band members miss a beat.

                                     NED
                         Maybe we should look for a cooler 
                         place.

                                     LOLA
                         I doubt we'll find one. Even the 
                         wind chimes on my porch aren't moving 
                         much these days. They keep thudding 
                         softly, like dairy cows bumping butts 
                         in the night. I go out there expecting 
                         to find a cool breeze... but it's 
                         just a lot of hot air.

               Ned glances at the MALE CUSTOMERS... sitting at the bar across 
               from them. They're staring coldly at Ned.

                                     NED
                         What're they lookin' at?

                                     LOLA
                         A lot of them have tried that seat. 
                         You're the first one's lasted this 
                         long.

                                     NED
                         I feel honored.

                                     LOLA
                         Don't. It's broken.

               A beat of realization, then the stool collapses with a CRASH! 
               Ned pulls himself back up and drags another stool over.

                                     NED
                         Did you bring the... papers?

                                     LOLA
                         No. I thought you might come over...

                                     NED
                         Sure. I'll drive you.

                                     LOLA
                         I brought my own car.

                                     NED
                         I'll follow you then.

                                     LOLA
                         I know it sounds silly, but would 
                         you leave first... wait in your car? 
                         I come here a lot and I wouldn't 
                         want those men to think I'm "easy"... 
                         a slut who'll jump into bed with 
                         anyone at the drop of a hat. But if 
                         you leave first...

                                     NED
                         ...they'll think I'm a putz for 
                         passing up a sure thing.

               Lola stares at Ned for a long moment... then SLAPS his face. 
               He doesn't move, remaining staunchly macho. Then, suddenly, 
               she SLUGS HIM so hard it knocks him over the top of the bar!

                                     LOLA
                              (for all to hear)
                         Now leave me alone!

               She pauses to give him a flicker of a COY SMILE... then picks 
               up her drink and moves to a nearby table. Ned struggles to 
               his feet and staggers to the door.

               INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT

               Ned is a mess! Blood trickles from the side of his mouth. 
               Shirt soaked in sweat. He turns the radio ON. LOLA'S THEME 
               starts playing.

               A small ceiling fan hangs from the interior roof of his car, 
               turning slowly. The venetian blinds on his side windows are 
               partially open, letting in slashes of dramatic light.

               ANGLE - HIS POV OF ROAD

               He's following Lola's car. It signals and turns left.

               INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT

               Still hot, Ned pulls the chain on the ceiling fan. It spins 
               faster. MUCH faster! The car becomes like a wind tunnel!

               EXT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The two cars enter a long drive, coming to a stop near a 
               large two story house surrounded by lush greenery.

               Ned climbs out... his wind-blown hair flattened on one side 
               and sticking out crazily.

               ANGLE - LOLA'S CAR DOOR - NED'S POV

               It opens. Lola's legs swing out. The CAMERA PANS DOWN her 
               long legs to her feet. The car floormat is stuck to one shoe. 
               She casually shakes it off... going to the front door.

               INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               They enter. It's DARK. Ned squints into the shadows.

                                     NED
                         Well, here we are... in the dark.

                                     LOLA
                         I have The Clapper.

                                     NED
                         You what?

               Lola CLAPS her hands twice and all the LIGHTS COME ON. She 
               smiles at him... drops her car keys on the hall table, then 
               goes up the stairs.

               Ned drops his car keys on the table too and follows her.

               EXT. PORCH OFF BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Lola clicks on a porch light. She and Ned step out. Dozens 
               of small boxes hang around the perimeter of the porch.

                                     LOLA
                         My wind chimes.

               Ned steps over, running his hands along the boxes. They "thud" 
               against each other.

                                     NED
                         You know, these would work a lot 
                         better if you took them out of the 
                         boxes.

               He slips several boxes off, releasing clusters of the metal 
               chimes. They "tinkle" and "clang" melodically in the breeze.

                                     LOLA
                         Well well... I guess you have been 
                         around. I'm impressed.

               She moves close, coming on to him. Ned feels uneasy.

                                     NED
                         Why don't we take a look at those... 
                         papers?

                                     LOLA
                              (remembering)
                         Papers. Right.

               INT. DRESSING AREA OFF BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Lola comes in, looks around, then down. She removes her shoe, 
               pulling off two scraps of paper stuck to the gum on her heel.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Ned is looking through a book... "KAMIKAZE KAMA SUTRA - The 
               Encyclopedia of Deadly Sexual Positions." Lola comes back 
               in, hands Ned the two scraps of paper.

                                     NED
                         That's it? These are the... papers?

                                     LOLA
                         Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can 
                         you tell me what they are?

               He checks them out... shrugs. It's obvious.

                                     NED
                         This one's a laundry receipt... and 
                         the other one's an expired lottery 
                         ticket.

               He hands them back to her, but she gently pushes them away.

                                     LOLA
                         No. You keep them... as a memento of 
                         our time together.

               She slips them into his jacket pocket... then sensuously 
               slides her hands around him, grabbing his buns, pulling him 
               closer.

                                     LOLA
                         I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay 
                         you for all you've done?

                                     NED
                         Cash would be nice.

                                     LOLA
                         Isn't there some other way?

                                     NED
                         I suppose you could wash my car.

                                     LOLA
                         No, I mean, isn't there something 
                         else you want? Something I could 
                         give you?

               She seductively starts to slide the jacket off his shoulders.

                                     NED
                         Hey... slow down... there's a speed 
                         limit in this state. Sixty-five miles 
                         an hour.

                                     NED
                         Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three.

                                     LOLA

                         me?

                                     NED
                         Suppose I let you off with a warning?

                         Suppose I find a cop with a bigger 
                         nightstick?

                                     NED
                         Suppose I put you under arrest for 
                         being a bad girl with bad thoughts?

                                     LOLA
                         Suppose you handcuff me to the bed?

                                     NED
                              (rapid run-on)
                         Suppose I do and then we lose the 
                         key and while I'm gone to get a 
                         duplicate made the house catches on 
                         fire and I can't get back to save 
                         you because the bridge is washed out 
                         and so you die a horrible death 
                         toasted like a Polish sausage on a 
                         flaming spit!
                              (shakes his head)
                         Nah... I better be going.

               He turns and leaves. She is stunned, confused, breathless.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

               Ned opens the door, pauses, turns... as Lola joins him there. 
               She looks into his eyes with desire.

                                     LOLA
                         You're not so tough. Last chance.

               She moves her lips close to his, about to kiss him. Then...

                                     NED
                         No thanks. I got a cold shower and a 
                         wife who trusts me waiting at home.

                                     LOLA
                         What's the matter? Don't you want 
                         me? It's the way I look, isn't it?

               He steps out, pauses... turns to her.

                                     NED
                         Don't forget to lock up.

               Ned pulls the door shut. The lock CLICKS. He pauses by his 
               car, realizing something, heaves a sigh, goes back to the 
               door.

               He tries the knob, but the door is locked. He looks through 
               the small window. He sees Lola standing inside... breathing 
               heavily, bracing herself against the staircase bannister, 
               hand to her heaving chest as if to calm a pounding heart.

               He pushes against the door. It won't budge. He goes to the 
               large window, gazing inside. She slides one hand enticingly 
               across her breast and thigh, striking a seductive pose.

               He points toward the door, motioning for her to unlock it. 
               She looks away. Frustrated, Ned tries the window. It's locked.

               He picks up a wrought iron chair, SLAMS it into the window! 
               The heavy chair falls apart. The glass doesn't even vibrate!

               He sees a riding power mower in the driveway... jumps into 
               the seat, starts the engine... barreling toward the front of 
               the house! THUNDER CRASHES and LIGHTNING FLASHES in the sky!

               He PLOWS into the side of the house, SMASHING a huge hole 
               thru the wall!... MOWING a swath in the carpet!

               Lola GASPS. Ned climbs off the mower, moving toward her. She 
               opens her arms, breathless. The MUSIC SWELLS dramatically! 
               She intercepts him, embracing him passionately.

                                     LOLA
                         I knew you'd come back...

                                     NED
                              (looking past her)
                         I forgot my car keys.

               He struggles free, grabbing his car keys from the hall table. 
               She follows, embracing him again, even more tenaciously.

                                     LOLA
                         That's not what you came back for.

                                     NED
                         Yes it is.

               Impatient, she crushes her mouth against his, kissing him 
               hard, desperately clawing at his clothes. She's relentless... 
               devouring him with her lips and tongue.

               Overwhelmed, he succumbs to her passion. His car keys drop 
               from his hand. She pushes him down toward the floor.

               LOW ANGLE - AT FLOOR LEVEL

               Her hands grasp his shirt, ripping it open. The buttons fly 
               in all directions! She grabs at his leather belt, twisting 
               it in her hands... ripping it in two!

               She grabs his pants by the cuffs... rips one pant leg off! 
               Then the other!... tossing them over each shoulder!

               Ned and Lola tumble across the floor, arms and legs 
               entangled... rolling themselves up in a rug in the process.

               ANGLE - FIREPLACE

               A roaring fire. We HEAR O.C. MOANING and HEAVY BREATHING. 
               The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a sheepskin rug in front of the 
               fireplace. No one is there! A crystal vase falls, CRASHING 
               on the stone hearth. The CAMERA TILTS UP to REVEAL Ned and 
               Lola... stretched out on the mantle, ravishing each other.

               ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR

               The door suddenly BURSTS OPEN! Ned and Lola tumble out... 
               wrapped in each other's arms, food tumbling out with them.

               OMIT

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               ANGLE - THE DINING ROOM TABLE

               The table wiggles. The CAMERA MOVES UP to REVEAL Ned and 
               Lola kissing passionately. She lays on the table, arms and 
               legs stretched upward... a spinning plate balanced on the 
               pointed finger of each hand... and a large spinning platter 
               balanced on the end of her pointed left toe. Her right foot 
               brushes the platter to keep it spinning. The Ed Sullivan 
               Show position.

               SEVERAL ANGLES - IN BED

               -- Ned and Lola's entangled legs, moving under the sheets.

               -- Ned sitting, wrists tied to the brass bed with silk 
               scarves.

               -- Lola, also with her wrists tied to the bed with silk 
               scarves.

               -- Then... A WIDER ANGLE... revealing that they are BOTH 
               tied... at opposite ends of the same bed!

               ANGLE - THE BASEMENT STAIRS

               Wrapped in each other's arms, they tumble down the stairs... 
               crashing into a workbench, still kissing passionately!

               ANGLE - A WALL SOCKET

               Ned's hand plugs in a cord. RACK FOCUS to a soft lamb's wool 
               BUFFER WHEEL rising into frame, WHIRRING. It dips into an 
               open can of FLOOR WAX... then moves over to Lola's naked 
               body, buffing the surface of her skin to a high gloss. The 
               CAMERA MOVES to her EYES. They're CROSSED in ecstasy.

               ANGLE - THE BEDROOM FLOOR

               HEAVY BREATHING. SQUEAKY BED NOISES. The CAMERA MOVES up 
               along the mattress. The bed moves with a jerky rhythm. The 
               CAMERA REVEALS Lola's hand, grasping the sheet tightly. WE 
               MOVE UP to Lola, lying face down against the pillow.

                                     LOLA
                              (breathless)

               FULL SHOT - THE BED

               Ned jumps up and down on the bed like a trampoline! Lola is 
               on her stomach, bouncing each time Ned's feet hit the bed.

                                     LOLA
                         ...Oh Ned... please... don't... 
                         stop...

               He does a complete BACK FLIP!... then keeps bouncing.

               EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               The wind blows. THUNDER and LIGHTNING! RAIN pours down.

               Ned and Lola, both in yellow rain slickers, ravish each other 
               lustfully on the roof, sliding down the incline of shingles. 
               Oblivious to the peril, they slip right over the edge!

               They hang from the eaves trough, each clutching it with one 
               hand while still holding one another with their free arms... 
               kissing passionately. The trough breaks! They fall!

               ANGLE - THE GROUND BELOW

               They roll out of the bushes onto the lawn, arms and legs 
               entangled. They fall apart, gasping for breath. A beat.

                                     LOLA
                         That takes care of foreplay.

               Ned's eyes widen. Lola grins lustily, rolling on top of him.

               INT. PRISON CELL - MORNING

               The cell wall is a clutter of PHOTOS: Hitler... Mussolini... 
               Charles Manson... and his mother, Mrs. Shady.

               A man's muscular naked torso rises into frame, his back to 
               us. He's doing pull-ups, his body covered with TATTOOS!

               Quotes on each arm... "Don't have a cow, man!" - Bart 
               Simpson... and "I know you are, but what am I?" - Pee Wee 
               Herman.

               On one shoulder, a gravestone with the epitaph "I told you I 
               was sick!"

               In the center of his back... we see a big tattoo of Ned's 
               face labeled "DEAD MEAT."

               A GUARD opens the cell door.

                                     GUARD
                         It's time, Max.

               The prisoner turns. He's butt-ugly, hard, nasty looking. 
               It's MAX SHADY... with a HUGE "Double Corona" CIGAR in his 
               mouth. On his chest is a tattoo that reads: THIS SPACE FOR 
               RENT. He walks right toward the CAMERA LENS and the FRAME 
               goes TO BLACK.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               EXT. FEDERAL PRISON - MORNING

               Two huge iron doors swing open and a mob of milling REPORTERS 
               rushes forward, surrounding Max Shady. He wears a blue suit 
               just like Ned's. The Reporters have no microphones, but shove 
               their empty hands at Max as if they do. They shout questions.

                                     MAX SHADY
                         Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a 
                         gift... to make up for losing my 
                         case. Now I'm going to wear it to 
                         his friggin' funeral!!

               Shady sees someone o.s., waves like a gleeful little kid.

                         Ma!

               INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               A ceiling fan rotates slowly... a pair of shorts and a nylon 
               stocking hanging from the blades. The house is a wreck!

               The CAMERA MOVES DOWN to Ned and Lola, both reclining in a 
               big claw-foot bathtub, facing each other, their arms draped 
               lazily over the sides. Ned's eyes are closed.

               "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" plays on the stereo in the b.g.

               Lola's hand reaches for an ICE PICK on the floor, raising it 
               up slowly. Then... CLICK!... ignites the cigarette lighter 
               in the handle, touching the flame to the end of her cigarette.

               She chips away a big chunk of ice from the block in a silver 
               ice bucket beside her... then sensuously rubs the ice across 
               her breasts. Ned winces at the sight of this.

               Lola smiles at him, then lets the chunk of ice slide into 
               the water... and pushes it between Ned's legs. He cringes, 
               eyes crossed. The familiar repetition of MUSICAL notes from 
               the stereo DRONES LOUDER... grabbing Ned's attention.

                                     NED
                         That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it?

                                     LOLA
                         It tells the sad story of a woman 
                         who is rejected by her lover after a 
                         brief, but torrid, affair... so she 
                         stalks him with an ice pick and stabs 
                         him with it more than a thousand 
                         times.

                         Really? I never could understand the 
                         lyrics.

               He lifts his feet out of the water, dangles them over each 
               side of the tub. He's still wearing one blue sock. Lola raises 
               her feet out of the water. She's still wearing her high heel 
               shoes. They are dripping.

                                     NED
                         You know, what happened last night 
                         was very, uh...

                                     LOLA
                         Yes... it was. I should check on my 
                         homeowners insurance.

                                     NED
                         But we can't ever let it happen again. 
                         Ever!

                                     LOLA
                         What are you saying, Ned? That you're 
                         rejecting me, your lover, after a 
                         brief, but torrid, affair?!

               Ned pulls his feet in, sits up... suddenly feeling vulnerable. 
               He measures his words very, very carefully.

                                     NED
                         I wouldn't put it exactly like that. 
                         It's just that... well, I'm married 
                         to a wonderful woman... who is very, 
                         very attractive...
                              (but adds quickly)
                         ...not that you aren't very 
                         attractive!

               His voice begins to ECHO and FADE as the CAMERA MOVES IN to 
               a CU of Lola's enraged EYES!

                                     NED
                              (voice echoing)
                         ...you aren't very attractive... you 
                         aren't very attractive... you aren't 
                         very attractive...

               And then WE SEE...

               A CLOSE SHOT of her hand, grasping the ice pick... scratching 
               it along the side of the tub, peeling back the porcelain. A 
               GRATING SCREECH OVERLAPS to...

               INT. PET STORE - DAY

               TIGHT on a SCREECHING TROPICAL BIRD. We PULL BACK to reveal 
               Ned looking around the store. His ripped pants have been 
               temporarily repaired with big pieces of masking tape. A CLERK 
               steps over with two big Parrots on her shoulders.

                                     CLERK
                         Don't touch anything. You bond with 
                         it... you buy it. Whatdya want?

                                     NED
                         I'd like to buy a pet.

               She eyes him suspiciously.

                                     CLERK
                         Yeah. For what purpose?

                                     NED
                         It's a gift... for my wife.

                                     CLERK
                         Right. They all say that.

                                     NED
                         She spends a lot of time alone. I 
                         thought it might be nice if she had 
                         something to keep her company.

                                     CLERK
                         Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know 
                         you're not the kind of guy who punches 
                         out parakeets? Or takes some poor 
                         defenseless animal, throws it in a 
                         sack and runs over it with your car 
                         five or six times.

                                     NED
                         I would never hurt an animal.

                                     CLERK
                         Boy, I would. They're driving me 
                         CRAZY!

                                     CLERK
                         Shuddup!

               They do. She turns back to Ned.

                                     CLERK
                         Okay... tell me more about this broad 
                         you're married to. I like to match 
                         people with the pets they deserve.

               INT. POLICE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

               A typical police squad room... smoke-filled, cluttered, busy. 
               Arch sits at a desk doing paperwork, surrounded by the Gang 
               Members... who are also filling out papers. Arch SINGS to 
               himself, munching on nachos from a big pile of chips. The 
               Gang Members harmonize with him.

               A Gang Member reaches for a nacho chip. Arch grabs for the 
               gun in his shoulder holster.

                                     ARCH
                         Uh-uh.

               The Gang Member drops the chip. Arch pops it in his mouth, 
               continues singing. The Gang Members join in with harmony.

               Ned enters in the background, carrying a box with airholes 
               in it. He steps over to his desk, looking at the singing 
               Gang Members, then motions like a choir leader, cutting them 
               off neatly.

                                     NED
                              (doubtful)
                         You do all my paperwork?

               They all hand over their completed paperwork. Ned stares at 
               them for a beat... surprised.

                                     NED
                         Get out of here.

               They do. He opens the files... checks out the papers. Arch 
               notices something O.S. and gets up.

                                     ARCH
                         And a damn good job, too. One of 'em 
                         even did it in Spanish.

               Arch turns the sound up on a wall-mounted TV monitor.

                                     ARCH
                         Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours.

               On the screen... it's Max Shady speaking to the press.

                         trying to find a constructive outlet.

                         He gets a little melon-dramatic.

               Arch slumps in his chair, really stunned.

                         Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit.

               Ned laughs it off. He starts checking through the messages 
               and paperwork on his desk. The PHONE RINGS. He picks it up.

               from the holes she's punctured in the side of the tub. She 
               flings the ice pick at the wall. It sticks!

               EXT. PARK - DAY

               Lana is seated on a park bench wearing a trenchcoat, hat and 
               sunglasses. Frank walks up, looks around nervously, pretending 
               not to know Lana. He sits down next to her.

                                     FRANK
                         How come we gotta meet here?

                                     LANA
                         We have to be careful now. We can't 
                         risk being seen together at the house 
                         or someone might connect us to the 
                         murder later on.

               She hands him a hat.

                                     LANA
                         Here... put this on.

               She takes her sunglasses off, looks at him. He hesitates, 
               staring at the hat. A dignified looking OLDER GENTLEMAN 
               approaches. Frank quickly slips the hat on his head.

               The Older Gentleman sits on the bench across from them. He 
               opens a paper sack and begins neatly laying his lunch out 
               next to him. An apple, sandwich, napkin, Mountain Dew.

                                     LANA
                              (whispers to Frank)
                         Speak Yiddish.

                                     FRANK
                         What?

                                     LANA
                         Red Yiddish.

               We see the SUB-TITLE "Speak Yiddish." From this point on, 
               all their dialog is in YIDDISH... but it appears in ENGLISH 
               SUB-TITLES across the bottom of the screen.

                                     FRANK
                         Ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der

                              (I been thinkin'... 
                              maybe this plan is 
                              too complicated.)

                                     LANA
                         Zein nisht azoy meshige! Der plan iz 
                         kosher vi yosher.
                              (Quit worrying. The 
                              plan is perfect.)

               INTERCUT - ANGLE ON OLDER GENTLEMAN

               He tosses crumbs of his sandwich to the pigeons, occasionally 
               glancing up at Frank and Lana. Whenever they speak, however, 
               his eyes look down toward their legs.

               INTERCUT - MEDIUM TWO-SHOT ON FRANK AND LANA

               with SUB-TITLES across the bottom of screen, about knee-level.

                                     FRANK
                         Yo! Ober mir darfen imvarfen in tsug. 
                         Un schissen un schtippen in vasser

                         bakackt.
                              (Yeah, but we gotta 
                              get him on the train, 
                              shoot him... then 
                              push him in the river. 
                              There's a million 
                              ways we can screw 
                              up.)

                                     LANA

                              soft on me, are you?)

                                     FRANK
                         Ven hob ich gehat a vaichen schmoke?
                              (When have I ever 
                              gone soft on you?)

                                     LANA
                         Lest'n Yomkippur.
                              (Last Yom Kippur.)

                                     FRANK
                         Nu shoin, ein mul. Es paseert tsie 
                         yeyden man.
                              (Okay... once! It 
                              happens to every 
                              guy.)

               He looks around nervously.

                                     FRANK
                         Oy! Mir vellen zein oif groise tsures. 
                         Me'vet unz chap'n.
                              (We're going to be in 
                              big trouble. They're 
                              going to catch us.)

                                     OLDER GENTLEMAN
                         There's very little risk involved. 
                         Statistics reveal that less than 
                         thirty-two percent of all murderers 
                         are ever apprehended.

               They both look at him... stunned. A long beat.

                                     LANA
                         You speak Yiddish?

                                     OLDER GENTLEMAN
                         No. But I can read sub-titles.

               Frank and Lana are speechless. But across the bottom of the 
               screen we see a SUB-TITLE reflecting their thoughts.

                                     SUB-TITLE
                         Oy vay!

               INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - DAY

               Ned enters, carrying the box. He sets it down on her desk.

                                     LAURA
                         Oh gee, you shouldn't have...

                                     NED
                         I didn't. It's for my wife.

               He goes into his office, starts to change out of his tattered 
               suit. Laura talks to him from the outer office.

                                     LAURA
                         She called. Wondered why you never 
                         came home last night. I told her you 
                         were working with a client, 
                         undercover.

               She steps into the doorway of his office.

                                     LAURA
                         Were you?

                                     NED
                         What?

                                     LAURA
                         There's lipstick on your collar.

               She returns to her desk. Disturbed, Ned quickly pulls the 
               shirt collar out, checks it.

                                     NED
                         No there isn't.

                                     LAURA
                         No... there isn't. But you answered 
                         my question. She's a real looker, 
                         huh?

                                     NED
                         Who?

                                     LAURA
                         Lola Cain.

                                     NED
                         I hadn't noticed.

               She opens the blinds behind her and looks at Ned through the 
               window between their offices.

                                     LAURA
                         Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't 
                         noticed.
                              (returns to work)
                         That's alright. She noticed enough 
                         for both of us.

               She picks up a stack of papers from the FAX machine. Ned 
               steps into the doorway, wearing a clean shirt.

                                     LAURA
                         I worry about you, Ned. I worry a 
                         lot.
                              (hands him papers)
                         Max Shady's been faxing death threats 
                         to you all morning.

                                     NED
                              (reading bits)
                         ...stick a knife in your...
                              (reacts, next)
                         ...rip the eyeballs out of your...
                              (next)
                         ...drive razor-sharp spikes under 
                         your...

                                     LAURA
                         Did you get to the one...?

                                     NED
                         ...cut it off... shove it in a 
                         blender.

                                     LAURA
                         Yeah... that one.

                                     NED
                              (tosses them aside)
                         He's just getting it out of his 
                         system. Once they say it... they 
                         never do it. You know... like the 
                         President.

               There's a KNOCK at the door. They look up to see an ominous 
               SILHOUETTE of a MAN on the milkglass. Ned starts toward the 
               door. Laura grabs his arm, stopping him.

                                     LAURA
                              (whispers)
                         Wait. It might be him.

               She opens her purse, pulls out a big COLT .45, holding it 
               out to him. Ned stares at it, taken aback.

                                     NED
                         Where did you get that?

                                     LAURA
                              (as if obvious)
                         From my purse.

                                     NED
                         What are you doing with it?

                                     LAURA
                              (still obvious)
                         Handing it to you.

                                     NED
                         Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun 
                         for?

                                     LAURA
                         You shoot it. A bullet comes out. 
                         Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a 
                         cop, I'd think you'd know these 
                         things.

                                     NED
                         Laura... put the gun away.

               He hands the gun back to her... goes to the door... opens 
               it. There's a young DELIVERY MAN holding a bouquet of flowers.

                                     DELIVERY MAN
                              (checks card)
                         Flowers for Ned Rav...
                              (looks up)
                         Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy? 
                         Man, you are dead meat!

               Ned grabs the flowers, slams the door. Laura takes the 
               envelope from the flowers... opens it.

                                     LAURA
                         Is this another sick joke from Max 
                         Shady?

               She looks at the card... her expression turning cold.

                                     NED
                         What is it...?

                                     LAURA
                              (hands it to him)
                         Lola Cain.

               She grabs the flowers... takes them into the bathroom.

                                     LAURA
                         I'll put these in water for you.

               Ned opens the envelope. An audio cassette drops into his 
               hand. Written on the label: PLAY ME.

               From the bathroom, we hear the LOUD SOUND of a TOILET 
               FLUSHING.

               INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT

               It's raining. Ned pops the cassette into the tape player.

                                     LOLA'S VOICE
                         Ned, darling... I know this seems 
                         like a strange way to talk with you... 
                         but since you won't take my calls, I 
                         have no other choice.
                              (then suddenly)
                         Watch it! That red car's turning 
                         left!

               Ned swerves to avoid a collision, HONKING his horn.

                                     LOLA'S VOICE
                         I love you, Ned. We're meant to be 
                         together... forever.
                              (then suddenly)
                         The light's changing! Floor it! Go! 
                         Go! Go!

               Ned guns it!... accelerating through a yellow light.

                                     LOLA'S VOICE
                         Nice move!
                              (then sincere again)
                         Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not 
                         even your wife. I'd hate to have to 
                         tell her about us, but if necessary... 
                         I will.

               We see HEADLIGHTS behind Ned's car.

               INT. LOLA'S CAR - NIGHT

               She is following him, her eyes intense, obsessed. Dizzy sits 
               in the back seat, noodling softly on his saxophone.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ned steps into the living room carrying the box. Lana comes 
               down the stairs, pulling on a bathrobe.

                                     LANA
                         What happened to you last night?

                                     NED
                              (guilty as charged)
                         Why? What have you heard?

                                     LANA
                              (sarcastic)
                         You could have called. But then, I 
                         suppose you were tied up.

                                     NED
                              (reflecting back)
                         Only part of the time.

                                     LANA
                         I never know when you're coming home, 
                         Ned. How can I ever make any plans?

               In the b.g., through the window, WE SEE Frank drop from the 
               second floor, right onto the seat of a waiting motorcycle. 
               He ZOOMS OFF into the night.

               Ned steps up behind Lana, slips his arms around her.

                                     NED
                         I promise I'll spend more time with 
                         you. I know it's been rough, being 
                         alone so much. But I'll make it up 
                         to you. Maybe we should try again, 
                         you know... to have a baby.

               She rolls her eyes at this... changes the subject.

                                     LANA
                         So what's in the box?

                                     NED
                         Oh... I brought you a present!

               He hands it to her. She opens it, looks in. She looks up, 
               struggling unsuccessfully to hide a look of displeasure.

                                     LANA
                         What is it?

                                     NED
                         It's... sorta like a cat.

               Ned pulls out a PET SKUNK and puts it in Lana's lap. She 
               forces a weak smile.

                                     LANA
                         Not enough like a cat.

                                     NED
                         It's a little skunk. I got it at 
                         Birds-and-Skunks-R-Us.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               Lola stands in the pouring rain outside, drenched... staring 
               at Lana and Ned through the window.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     NED
                         So... what're you going to name him?

                                     LANA
                         How about... Ned?

                                     NED
                              (thinks about it)
                         Yeah. Got a nice ring to it. I've 
                         always liked the name Ned.

                                     LANA
                         No kidding.

               He puts his arms around them both.

                                     NED
                         So whatdya think? You love Ned Junior 
                         as much as you love me?

                                     LANA
                         At least.

               The phone RINGS. Lana stands up, unceremoniously dropping 
               the Skunk into Ned's arms. She goes into...

               THE ADJOINING ROOM

               ...to answer the phone.

                                     LANA
                         Hello?... Hello?... Hello?
                              (then, whispering)
                         Frank? Is that you?

               EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

               Lola is in a glass telephone booth with venetian blinds and 
               a ceiling fan. She cracks the blinds open. In the background, 
               through a window, we can see Lana in the house on the phone.

                                     LANA
                              (filtered)
                         I told you not to call. Frank? FRANK!

               INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

               Ned enters the cavernous marble rotunda, turns down a hallway 
               crowded with milling attorneys and defendants. Lola suddenly 
               intercepts him... a newspaper trailing from her high heel 
               shoe.

                                     LOLA
                         Who's Frank?

                                     NED
                         Frank? The only Frank I know is an 
                         auto mechanic... but I sure as hell 
                         wouldn't recommend the guy. He's 
                         really slow.

               He starts to move off, but she stops him, impassioned.

                                     LOLA
                         I had to see you, Ned. I need to 
                         feel your arms around me! I wanna 
                         suck your toes til the nails pop 
                         off!

               Lola's voice ECHOES. BYSTANDERS gather, listening. Ned looks 
               around self-consciously, embarrassed.

                                     NED
                         I told you, what happened was a big 
                         mistake. A one night stand. It's 
                         over. I have a wife...

               The CROWD presses closer... not missing a thing. A WOMAN 
               snaps a FLASH PICTURE! A MAN turns on his video camera.

                                     LOLA
                         It doesn't matter. She'll know all 
                         about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In 
                         my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE!

               Mortified, Ned spins on his heels and makes a bee-line for 
               the safety of the Men's Room. Lola holds up two tickets.

                                     LOLA
                         I got us tickets to see Iron 
                         Butterfly!

                                     NED
                         I hate opera!

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY

               Ned bursts in, goes to the urinal... not noticing BEN ARUGULA, 
               an older gentleman in a business suit, standing at the urinal 
               next to him. A beat later... Lola enters.

                                     LOLA
                         Why are you running from me? Didn't 
                         it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing 
                         my buns with carnuba wax?
                              (looks down)
                         Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey 
                         want to go exploring?

                                     NED
                         He's busy right now.

               Arugula glances sideways at Ned, curious and uneasy.

                                     NED
                         Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a 
                         big mistake! One lousy mistake in 
                         his whole stinkin' life! So why don't 
                         you give him a BREAK! Besides... he 
                         belongs to my wife!

               EXT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

               Lana FIRES her gun rapidly... BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!... 
               over her shoulder, behind her back, under her leg.

               ANGLE ON TARGET

               A full-body cut-out of a man, wearing one of Ned's trademark 
               gray suits. A HUGE SMOKING HOLE has been blown right through 
               the crotch! Lana smirks, inhales the SMOKE from the gun 
               barrel... and blows it out.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               TILT DOWN from an official government seal that reads "ARS 
               GRATIA ARTIS." JUDGE Ben Arugula... the distinguished looking 
               gentleman from the men's room, sits on the bench. Ned, Laura 
               and a SLIMY DEFENDANT stand at the defense table.

                                     JUDGE ARUGULA
                         I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey 
                         for setting yet another unusual legal 
                         precedent. This is the first time 
                         I've ever tried a case in which the 
                         JURY was found to be insane.

               ANGLE - JURY AND BAILIFF

               The BAILIFF is handing out straitjackets to all the JURORS. 
               The Jury Foreman struggles to get his on and laced up.

                                     BAILIFF
                              (to another Juror)
                         What're you? A thirty-eight long?

               BACK TO JUDGE ARUGULA

                                     JUDGE ARUGULA
                         The jury will be remanded to the 
                         Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi 
                         Valley. Court's adjourned.

               INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

               The JURY is led from the courtroom in straitjackets and 
               chains. Ned and Laura follow them out.

                                     NED
                         Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you 
                         tell me?

                                     LAURA
                         It's not important. I just had one 
                         last year.

                                     NED
                         Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate!

               In the b.g. the Slimy Defendant pulls a gun and forces 
               CITIZENS... including Judge Arugula... up against the wall, 
               robbing them!

                                     LAURA
                         Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll 
                         have another one sometime.

                                     NED
                         I insist. And I want to get you a 
                         nice present.

                                     LAURA
                         You're so sweet. You don't have to. 
                         You gave me a present last year. 
                         Those lovely Ginzu knives.

                                     NED
                         Yeah... aren't they great! They last 
                         forever. And you can cut right through 
                         a shoe with 'em!

               As they walk off, we HOLD ON a CLOSE SHOT of a newspaper. 
               The headline reads: EX-CON STALKS COP/LAWYER NED RAVINE! 
               Below it is a picture of Max Shady, eyes wide with psychotic 
               rage... a huge cigar in his mouth, wearing a garish Hawaiian 
               shirt.

               Hands lower the newspaper... revealing Max himself, with the 
               same cigar, shirt and crazed look on his face.

               INT. LE MISS FASHION BOUTIQUE - DAY - MONTAGE

               Laura models hats... each one becoming more outrageous. She 
               coaxes Ned into joining her. They BOTH try on WOMEN's hats... 
               smiling and laughing... as "Brown Eyed Girl" plays.

               In one of the mirrors, we SEE Max Shady's reflection... as 
               he also tries on women's hats, watching them, puffing his 
               cigar.

               INT. LE HULA BOWL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Laura wears a baseball cap with beer cans attached to each 
               side with long, curved plastic straws. The cap emblem reads 
               "BEER BIMBO." A price tag hangs from it. She is beaming.

               In the b.g., Hawaiian DANCERS juggle flaming torches as they 
               dance around an ICE SCULPTURE of a Hula Dancer.

                                     NED
                         It's nice to be off the streets... 
                         away from all the pain and misery 
                         out there.

               Ned motions casually toward the world "out there"... sticking 
               his thumb into the eye of a WAITER who is bending over to 
               pick up a spoon, setting off a chaotic CHAIN REACTION of 
               small disasters that finally culminates with someone near 
               the dance floor bumping into the Torch Juggler, throwing his 
               rhythm off.

               Distracted, he starts catching the FLAMING ENDS of the 
               torches! OW! OH! YI! OUCH! YIPES!

               He drops them all. The Waiter who bumped into him, politely 
               picks up one of the flaming torches and hands it back to the 
               Torch Juggler. He grabs the flaming end of the torch... and 
               lets out a SCREAM!

               He lunges toward a voluptuous HULA GIRL ICE SCULPTURE, 
               grabbing the frozen breasts. His burned hands SIZZLE!

               Ned and Laura don't even notice... gazing only at each other.

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         What's he thinking when he looks at 
                         me with that goofy smile...?

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         Boy, does she look stupid in that 
                         hat.

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         If I told him how I really feel, 
                         he'd probably fire me. What am I 
                         saying? He probably doesn't even 
                         know I exist.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         Laura's incredible. And so smart. 
                         Smart enough to recognize that Ginzu 
                         knives are the gift of a lifetime.
                              (then, concerned)
                         But she never goes out with guys. I 
                         wonder why?

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         I guess I'll just have to wait. But 
                         he's married. I could wait forever. 
                         Than again... maybe Lana will get 
                         hit by a runaway truck. There's always 
                         a chance that...

                                     NED (V.O.)
                              (interrupting)
                         But who cares if she... Oh, sorry.

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         That's alright. I was just rambling.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         Go ahead...

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         No, no, really... you first...

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         I insist... please...

                                     LAURA
                         Oh, uh... I just wanted to remind 
                         you about...

                                     NED

                         Yeah. I'm driving up in the morning.

               ANGLE - MAX SHADY

               sits at a corner table wearing a chic beret from the hat 
               store, voraciously devouring a huge Hawaiian Pit Roasted 
               Pig. He wrenches the apple from the Pig's mouth... takes a 
               huge bite!

               BACK TO NED AND LAURA

               A saxophone begins to wail "Lola's Theme." Ned looks up, his 
               eyes drawn to the lounge. He sees...

               Lola... striking a sexy pose on a bar stool, eyes locked on 
               Ned. Dizzy walks thru, behind the bar, playing his sax.

               She grabs a handful of cherries from a glass on the bar, 
               shoves them in her mouth, cheeks bulging, tongue moving 
               furiously. A moment later, she pulls out a long chain of 
               inter-locked cherry stems.

               Ned reacts, shaken, glancing nervously at Laura. She smiles, 
               unaware. His eyes flash back to Lola.

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         He's so cute. He can't even look me 
                         in the eye.

               Ned's reacts intensely to...

               LOLA - NED'S POV

               She stretches out sensuously on the bar, executing a series 
               of humanly impossible erotic gymnastic positions! Then, 
               wrapping her legs around a brass pole, she spins no-handed... 
               until her thighs begin to SMOKE!

               REVERSE ANGLE - ON ENTIRE ROOM

               The eyes of every MALE in the restaurant are riveted on Lola!

               CLOSER ON NED AND LAURA

               The table starts to rise slowly on Ned's side, glasses sliding 
               toward Laura. She reaches out to stop them... noticing Ned's 
               distracted expression.

                                     LAURA
                              (touching his arm)
                         What is it, Ned? You can tell me.

                                     NED
                              (sighs, reluctant)
                         I'm a man, Laura. And all men feel 
                         passion at one time or another. Even 
                         me.

                                     LAURA
                              (hopeful)
                         Really?

                                     NED
                         What would you think of a married 
                         man who gave in to those wild, 
                         sensual, raging desires?

                                     LAURA
                         Oh... wow... golly...

               She gulps, eyes wide. The DRUMS pound faster as the Dancers 
               in the b.g. pick up the frenetic tempo!

                                     NED
                         What if, for just one crazy moment, 
                         he couldn't resist...? He got knocked 
                         for a loop and lost control?

                                     LAURA
                              (smiles, eager)
                         Gosh... that might be okay.

               Breathless, she breaks a sweat, gasping for air. The DRUMS 
               beat LOUDER, FASTER. The b.g. Dancers whip into a frenzy!

                                     NED
                         What if a tidal wave of lust crashed 
                         over him and he was sucked into a 
                         vortex of wild, thrashing urges?

               Both of Laura's ballcap beer cans EXPLODE! Beer SPRAYS out 
               in a huge gush, drenching her! Ned is so preoccupied with 
               his own dilemma, he doesn't even notice. He heaves a sigh... 
               pats her hand... smiles philosophically.

                                     NED
                         Well... it's not your problem. I'll 
                         work it out.

               ANGLE - AN ICE PICK

               grasped tightly in Lola's hand. She walks toward Ned and 
               Laura, a seething rage in her eyes.

               As she passes the ice sculpture, she stabs the ice pick into 
               the crystalline Hula Dancer's neck! The head breaks off. She 
               catches it and keeps coming, tossing the head casually in 
               one hand, like a basketball.

               Lola appears suddenly at Ned and Laura's table. They look 
               up.

                                     LOLA
                              (to Laura)
                         Like some ice for your drink?

               She drops the ice Mermaid head. It shatters Laura's glass to 
               bits! Lola turns to Ned with a cold glare.

                                     LOLA
                         Does your wife know you're... 
                         "working" late? I certainly hope so, 
                         Mr. Ravine.

               She lights her cigarette with the ice pick lighter, then 
               flips it like a jackknife. It STICKS into Ned's chair, right 
               between his legs.

               Lola flashes a coldly arrogant smile at Laura... then exits.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING

               Frank opens the hood to Ned's car, holding a screwdriver in 
               one hand... a wrench in the other. He doesn't know where to 
               start.

               CLOSE ANGLE - MAX SHADY'S FEET - MORNING

               A NEWSBOY tosses a folded newspaper. It lands at Max Shady's 
               feet. Max picks up the paper, opens it. The headline says: 
               SHADY READS NEWSPAPER IN FRONT OF RAVINE RESIDENCE! Max looks 
               around self-consciously, eyes shifting uneasily.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Lana stands by the front door. She calls upstairs to Ned.

                                     LANA
                         Hurry up, darling. You'll be late!

               Frank slips in, wearing his greasy overalls. He wipes his 
               hands on a rag... giving Lana a sly wink.

                                     FRANK
                              (whispering)
                         It's all taken care of. When do I 
                         knock on the door?

                                     LANA
                         Wait until I signal you. When I raise 
                         the blinds... you knock.

               She steps over to the blinds and demonstrates. He knocks.

                                     LANA
                         Not now!

                                     FRANK
                         Oh, later... right... okay.

               She nods, patronizing. Frank exits. Lana picks up the Skunk, 
               cuddling him. Ned comes down wearing his trademark gray suit. 
               Lana kisses him passionately... a final farewell.

                                     LANA
                         Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye-
                         bye to Little Ned. He loves his 
                         daddy... don't you Stink Pot?

                                     NED
                              (pets the skunk)
                         See you tonight, Junior.

               As soon as Ned closes the door, Lana's smile vanishes and 
               she casually tosses the Skunk aside with a LOUD CRASH O.C.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING

               Ned turns the car key. Nothing. He gets out, opens the hood. 
               He stares... dumbfounded.

               INT. THE HOUSE - MORNING

               Ned comes in, visibly upset. Lana acts surprised.

                                     LANA
                         What's wrong?

                                     NED
                         This neighborhood is getting worse 
                         all the time! Damn kids stole my 
                         engine!

                                     LANA
                         Why don't you catch the train to 
                         Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty 
                         minutes.

                                     NED
                         I'll just fly up.

                                     LANA
                         No!

               Ned looks at her strangely. She catches herself.

                                     LANA
                         I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists 
                         seized the airport this morning. A 
                         plane crashed into the tower... and 
                         all the runways are on fire!

                         And it's fogged in.

                                     LANA
                         For my peace of mind... take the 
                         train.

               Lana goes to the window, starts to raise the blinds.

                                     NED
                         I can't do it. You know how I feel 
                         about riding trains.

               She stops... letting the blinds drop down.

                                     LANA
                         Darling... it's only a short trip.

                         Yeah... right. A short trip.

               She starts to raise the blinds again. He picks up the phone.

                              (he hesitates)
                         A short trip to hell in a metal tomb!

               He slams the receiver down. Lana drops the blinds again...

                         All killed by trains!

                                     LANA
                              (very convincing)
                         Coincidence, Ned. Beside... that's 
                         the past. They're gone.

                                     NED
                              (sighs, resigned)
                         Yeah. I guess I can't bring them 
                         back by not riding on a train.

                                     LANA
                         That's right.

               She starts to raise the blinds again...

                                     NED
                         But I just can't get over this stupid 
                         nagging fear that...

               She abandons the blinds, leaving them raised part way...

                                     LANA
                         Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I 
                         don't want to raise a child in a 
                         home filled with fear!

               There's a KNOCK at the door. Lana tugs on the cord and the 
               blinds drop with a CRASH. The KNOCKING stops. She pretends 
               it didn't even happen, racing on.

                                     LANA
                         But if you can conquer your fear... 
                         maybe I can conquer my fear of having 
                         a baby with a father who's fearful.
                              (goes for broke)
                         Ned... don't let a train kill our 
                         child before it's even conceived!

                                     NED
                              (heaves a sigh)
                         I guess you're right.

               She grabs the cord, then hesitates...

                                     LANA
                         You're sure now...?

               A beat. He nods. She quickly pulls the blinds up.

                                     NED
                         But we'll never make it to the 
                         station. By the time a cab gets 
                         here...

               A LOUD KNOCK at the front door. Lana opens it. It's Frank.

                                     FRANK
                         I was in the neighborhood. Thought 
                         I'd stop by and pick up my tools.

                                     LANA
                         Frank will drive you. Won't you Frank?

                                     FRANK
                         Sure, I'll take you to the train 
                         station.

               They all freeze. Lana glares at Frank, who is completely 
               unaware of his faux pas... while Ned tries to figure out why 
               that response didn't sound right.

               INT. FRANK'S VAN - DAY

               They climb into the van. Ned nervously checks his watch.

                                     NED
                         Twelve minutes. We'll never make it.

               EXT. FRANK'S VAN - DAY

               The CAMERA BOOMS DOWN LOW to reveal Max Shady under the van, 
               hanging on like a leech, his back only inches from the road. 
               The van drives off.

               INT. FRANK'S VAN - MINUTES LATER

               At an intersection... they see a "DETOUR" sign. Frank and 
               Lana exchange concerned looks. Frank turns the corner. The 
               van starts vibrating violently, tossing them around.

                                     NED
                              (checks his watch)
                         We're not going to make it.

                                     FRANK
                         We'll make it!

               He shifts gears, guns the engine. They rocket ahead, BOUNCING 
               WILDLY, their heads THUMPING the car roof! The van SPLASHES 
               through deep water, a huge fantail spraying out on both sides.

               EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

               The train is pulling in. The CAMERA PANS to Frank's muddy 
               van as it drives up nearby. Frank waits in the van as Ned 
               and Lana get out and walk toward the train.

               They pass a feeble OLD WOMAN struggling to drag a HUGE STEAMER 
               TRUNK along the platform... inches at a time. A REDCAP passes 
               her also, carrying a small overnight case for an attractive, 
               elegantly attired SOCIALITE. Everyone ignores the Old Woman.

               Ned looks nervously at the train, already pale.

                                     LANA
                         Okay... now what're you going to do 
                         if you feel queasy going through the 
                         tunnel?

                                     NED
                         I'll stand in the vestibule between 
                         the cars.

                                     LANA
                         That's right. When you get queasy... 
                         go stand in the vestibule between 
                         the cars.

               She kisses his cheek. He reluctantly boards the train. Her 
               smile vanishes.

               She hurries back to the next car, nods at Frank, boards the 
               train. Frank peels off his coveralls, follows her on.

               ANGLE - COACH PLATFORM

               Laura's Husband steps from the train, holding the deflated 
               Ninja Turtle float ring. He looks around, then walks toward 
               the cab stand. The CAMERA MOVES with him, then HOLDS ON...

               MAN READING NEWSPAPER - TIGHT SHOT

               The headline says: SHADY VOWS BLENDER VENGEANCE ON RAVINE! 
               Under the headline is a picture of Max Shady... muddy, bloody, 
               greasy, clothes ripped, cigar shredded... looking off.

               The paper lowers, revealing Max... a battered mess, looking 
               off. He picks up a small violin case and quickly moves toward 
               the train as it starts to pull out.

               We now SEE that the seat of Max's pants has been ripped out, 
               his naked buttocks scratched and scraped raw by the road.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned stares out the window... apprehensive, nervous.

               Frank and Lana enter at the opposite end of the coach. They 
               spot Ned, quickly ducking into a seat where they can observe 
               him yet remain hidden from view behind the tall seatbacks.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               Max walks through the car looking for Ned. He pauses, puffing 
               on his big cigar. A WOMAN PASSENGER looks up and is shocked 
               to see Max's scraped bare butt hanging out only inches away.

                                     WOMAN PASSENGER
                         OH! My dear gracious!

               Max swivels around to look at her... turning his bare behind 
               toward an IRRITABLE MAN across the aisle.

                                     IRRITABLE MAN
                         SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish 
                         that foul smelling cigar?

                                     MAX
                              (turning slowly)
                         You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU 
                         want me to put out my cigar? You 
                         want ME to put out my CIGAR?

                                     IRRITABLE MAN
                         Yeah.

                                     MAX
                         Certainly.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Max enters through the vestibule, without his cigar, stopping 
               in his tracks when he sees Ned. He smiles to himself, then 
               ducks back into the lavatory.

               INT. LAVATORY - DAY

               Max looks at himself in the mirror. He's a disaster. He opens 
               the violin case, pulling out his trademark "Ned Ravine" gray 
               suit on a hangar. It's not even wrinkled.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned looks pale... sweating... reacting tensely to every lurch 
               and bump the train makes. The feeble Old Woman strains to 
               pull her huge steamer trunk down the aisle, inch by inch, 
               toward Ned.

               ANGLE ON FRANK AND LANA

               Lana peers over the seat, watching Ned with a cruel smile.

                                     LANA
                         It's already getting to him. He'll 
                         be out of that seat and into the 
                         vestibule within ten minutes... I 
                         guarantee it.

               INT. LAVATORY - DAY

               Max is cleaned up, dressed in the suit. He straightens his 
               tie, slicks his greasy hair back, sticks a big cigar in his 
               mouth and grins at himself in the mirror.

                                     MAX
                         You talkin' to me? You talkin' to 
                         ME? You... talkin'... to... ME?

               He reaches into the violin case, pulls out a complex 
               assortment of metal parts, assembling them swiftly. CLICK... 
               SNAP... CLUNK! It's an incredibly nasty looking high-tech, 
               automatic weapon with gigantic cartridge clip.

               He screws on a long silencer and points the gun at the 
               ceiling. POOF!... a muffled gunshot! Debris fall around him. 
               He looks up. He has blown a HOLE through the roof of the 
               coach.

               He adjusts the Silencer Volume Control, which has a scale 
               from 1 thru 11. He turns it all the way down to "0"... DEAD 
               SILENT. He pulls the trigger. The gun RECOILS, but there is 
               absolutely NO SOUND! He has blown another HOLE in the ceiling.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned looks across the aisle to see a GROSS SLOB pulling all 
               kinds of strange food items from a paper bag, making a big, 
               sloppy, disgusting SANDWICH that squirts and drips all over. 
               Ned turns away... really queasy now.

               INT. LAVATORY - DAY

               Max reaches into the case, pulls out A BLENDER! He plugs it 
               into the outlet and REVS it a couple times, grinning wickedly.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Max steps out of the lavatory and sees the CONDUCTOR coming 
               his way collecting tickets. He quickly spins around, slides 
               the door open and steps into the vestibule between cars.

               The Conductor can't get past the Old Woman, so he climbs 
               over the top of her trunk, with no thought of helping her.

               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Max looks out the side window, trying to conceal the weapon 
               in front of him. The Conductor enters, sees him.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Ticket?

               Without turning, Max holds the ticket up over his shoulder. 
               The Conductor takes it, punches it, notices the gun barrel.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Sorry pal... automatic weapons are 
                         only allowed in the club car after 
                         nine p.m.

               Max turns, raising the gun with a nasty GROWL. The Conductor 
               casually snaps a baggage tag to the barrel, taking the gun.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         I'll check it with baggage. You can 
                         claim it at the depot in Santa 
                         Barbara.

               The Conductor drops the weapon into a big mesh bag... along 
               with a dozen other guns he's collected. He exits. Max whirls 
               around facing the window, eyes filled with rage. Now what?

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               A gun barrel slowly protrudes between the seats in front of 
               Frank and Lana. Their eyes widen. Suddenly, a stream of water 
               hits Frank in the face! He sputters. A LITTLE KID named JEFF 
               scrambles into the aisle.

                                     JEFF
                         Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years 
                         old. Didja know if ya put a penny on 
                         the track it'll make the train crash? 
                         No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck? 
                         My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really 
                         neat. Everybody gets creamed! All 
                         bloody guts... heads ripped off and 
                         stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song 
                         "Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy 
                         Gopher Guts"?

               Lana turns to Frank... inspired. She leans toward Jeff.

                                     LANA
                         You want to earn a couple bucks, 
                         kid?

               ANGLE ON NED

               Jeff bounces into the seat across from Ned.

                                     JEFF
                         Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years 
                         old. Didja know if ya put a penny on 
                         the track it'll make the train crash?

               ANGLE ON FRANK AND LANA

               Lana peers over the seat at Ned. She smiles.

                                     LANA
                         He's losing it. You better get up to 
                         the next car. Remember, give me the 
                         high sign as soon as you see the 
                         river. It'll be two minutes and nine 
                         seconds past the tunnel. I'll take 
                         care of the rest. Anything goes 
                         wrong... just make sure you back me 
                         up.
                              (grabs his collar)
                         And don't let him see you.

               Frank gets up, moves down the aisle slowly, eyes on Ned. He 
               can't squeeze past the Old Woman, who is still struggling to 
               pull her huge trunk down aisle. So... he climbs right over 
               the top of it... oblivious to her.

               Frank stares at Ned warily as he gets closer. Suddenly, Jeff 
               squirts a stream of water in Ned's eyes. Frank sees his 
               chance, rushing past Ned toward the vestibule.

               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Frank races through the vestibule behind Max's back. By the 
               time Max turns to see who's there... Frank is gone.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned wipes the water from his eyes, blinking. He grabs the 
               squirt gun away from Jeff, holding it up angrily.

                                     NED
                         This... is not a toy!

                                     JEFF
                         Yes it is.

               A beat. Ned realizes he's right. Acting tough, he pulls the 
               plug and drains the water out of the gun, then tosses it 
               back to Jeff.

               Without missing a beat, Jeff drops the empty water magazine 
               from the grip and jams a full one in... just like loading a 
               cartridge clip. He smirks, ready for action.

               In the aisle next to them, the Old Woman now pulls her trunk 
               back toward the vestibule. Jeff points the squirt gun at 
               her. Suddenly, she whips around and SQUIRTS HIM in the face 
               with her own squirt gun! He sputters!

               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Max stares out the window, still seething. Behind him, the 
               Old Woman moves into the vestibule, inch by inch, trying to 
               drag her trunk into the first coach car.

               Max turns, sees her struggling and goes to her aid.

                                     MAX
                         Here... let me help you with that.

               He pushes the trunk into the first coach car, then very 
               politely holds the door open for her. She smiles sweetly at 
               him as she shuffles through.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         What a nice young man. You are so 
                         polite.

                                     MAX
                              (smiles)
                         I try to be.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Jeff is SINGING to Ned... to the tune of "The Old Gray Mare."

                                     JEFF
                         Great green gobs of greasy, grimy 
                         gopher guts... mutilated monkey 
                         meat... chopped up dirty birdie's 
                         feet... one pint jar of all-purpose 
                         porpoise pus... cooked in a Mulligan 
                         stew.

               Ned turns queasy. The train lurches. He stiffens.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               The Old Woman has unpacked her huge trunk. She has hung up 
               clothes... set out a vase with flowers... hung up a big framed 
               painting... and turned on a floor lamp. She pulls out a set 
               of dumbbells, pumps them a couple times... and drops them on 
               the floor with a loud CLUNK!

               Frank watches her from his seat across the aisle with a blank 
               expression... only his eyes moving.

               The Conductor punches the Old Woman's ticket, then holds out 
               his hand, waiting. She pulls out a Smith & Wesson .44 
               Magnum... drops it in his bag. He waits. She pulls out an 
               Uzi.

               EXT. THE TRACKS AHEAD - MOVING SHOT - DAY

               Up ahead, we see a tunnel approaching.

                              (still singing)
                         French fried eyeballs and ugly scabs 
                         you wanna pick... stuff to make your 
                         mother sick... dog poop on a stick... 
                         puke and snot all mixed together in 
                         a pot...

               Ned is looking very pale and queasy. Suddenly, Jeff jumps 
               up... presses his face against the window.

                                     JEFF
                         Oh boy! Here comes the tunnel!

               Ned can't take it anymore. He gets up, pale and sweating.

               EXT. TRACKS AHEAD - MOVING SHOT - DAY

               ...racing toward the tunnel!

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana sees Ned stumble shakily into the aisle, moving toward 
               the vestibule.

                                     LANA
                         Way to go, Ned. Right on time.

               The train enters the TUNNEL. Everything goes PITCH BLACK. A 
               few beats, then... LIGHT fills the car again as they emerge 
               from the tunnel. Lana looks. Ned is gone! She heads down the 
               aisle.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               The Conductor is still tagging weapons as the Old Woman comes 
               up with a Ruger Mini 14 machine gun, a Mauser C96 automatic 
               handgun, a sawed-off double-barreled .12 gauge shotgun... 
               and an old wooden slingshot.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana looks through the small window into the vestibule and 
               catches a glimpse of a gray suit. She ducks back, leaning 
               against the lavatory door.

               INT. LAVATORY - THE MIRROR - DAY

               Ned's dripping face rises up from the sink into view. He 
               splashes more water on, trying to overcome his queasiness.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana reaches into her purse, pulls out a gun. She looks 
               through the vestibule windows into the first coach car, her 
               eyes searching for Frank.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - LANA'S POV - DAY

               Frank pokes his head out into the aisle, looking toward Lana. 
               He waves at her.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana ducks back, pressing herself against the lavatory door... 
               gripping the gun, tense.

               INT. LAVATORY - DAY

               Ned starts to open the door, then stops. He notices the violin 
               case. Opens it. A couple of bullets roll around inside. Then, 
               he sees the blender... puzzled.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana leans forward, looking through the vestibule windows, 
               watching desperately for Frank's signal.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               Frank looks out the window and sees...

               EXT. THE RIVER - FRANK'S POV

               It looms ahead.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana sees Frank's frantic signal. She raises the gun, pulls 
               the hammer back and steps quickly into...

               INT. THE VESTIBULE - DAY

               Max hears someone enter. He stiffens...

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned steps out of the lavatory.

               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Lana FIRES!... blowing a hole right through Max and the window 
               behind him! She keeps firing! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
               BLAM! More bullets than the gun could ever possibly hold!

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned hears the GUNSHOTS and whirls around, looking into the 
               vestibule through the glass window, just as...

               INT. VESTIBLE - DAY

               ...Max turns to face Lana, filled with bloody bullet holes.

                                     MAX
                         You shootin' at me?

               Shocked to see it's Max, Lana empties the rest of the bullets 
               into him... BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Max is SLAMMED back into 
               the vestibule door by the impact!

                                     MAX
                         Yeah... you're definitely shootin' 
                         at me.

               She fires one last shot... BLAM!!!

               EXT. TRAIN ON BRIDGE - DAY

               Max flies out the door, executing a perfect "full gainer 
               with a triple twist and a half-tuck"... a flawless Olympic 
               style dive... ending with a dead body "belly flop" into the 
               water!

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               Frank sees Max hit the river and lets out a loud "WHOOP!" 
               The Old Woman shoots him a nasty look. He stifles himself.

               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Ned slides the vestibule door open... steps toward Lana. In 
               a daze, she raises the gun, points it at him, pulling the 
               trigger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. He takes the gun from 
               her gently.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               Frank jumps up, rushing forward. He skids to a stop... seeing 
               Ned through the glass! Shocked, he ducks back.

                         And look, look... he autographed it.

               Arch pulls the front cover of the book open, pointing.

                         sometime... Hannibal.
                              (hands it back)
                         Very nice.

               Arch points toward the cage.

                                     ARCH
                         They're waiting for ya. They didn't 
                         want to start without her attorney 
                         being present.

               CLOSE ON LANA - CANTED ANGLE

               There's a BIG MOTH on her mouth. The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY. 
               A beat... she spits the moth off, irritated.

                                     LANA
                         PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could 
                         use a good exterminator.

               Three POLICE INVESTIGATORS sit opposite Lana at a long table. 
               Moths flutter everywhere.

                                     INVESTIGATOR # 2
                              (to Police Guard)
                         Let's get the SWAT Team in here.

               Ned, Laura and Arch enter the cage as the Guard exits.

                                     LANA
                         Can't you get me out of this cage, 
                         Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here.

                                     NED
                         Judge said no bail. Don't worry. 
                         Just tell the truth, you'll be fine.

               He turns to the Investigators.

                                     NED
                         Who's gonna handle the interrogation?

                                     INVESTIGATOR 1
                         It's your collar... your bust... 
                         your call... your show... your play... 
                         your move... your wife...

                                     NED
                         Okay, okay!... I'll handle it.

               Laura sits at the far end of the table and opens her notebook. 
               Lana pulls out her mirrored compact, starts to apply lipstick.

                                     INVESTIGATOR 2
                         Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup 
                         allowed in this building.

               He nods toward a warning sign: a circle around a LIPSTICK 
               with a diagonal line thru it. She responds, cool, confident.

                                     LANA
                         What're you gonna do... arrest me 
                         for primping?

               In the b.g., members of the SWAT Team desperately swat at 
               the fluttering moths.

               Ned spins his chair around, plants one foot on it, leans on 
               his knee, looking hard at Lana.

                                     NED
                         Don't give us a tough time. Just 
                         spill it! What were you doing on 
                         that train?

                                     LANA
                         Well...

               Ned raises his hand, sits down, leans close, changing his 
               tone.

                                     NED
                              (confidential)
                         As your attorney, I must advise you... 
                         you don't have to answer that 
                         question.

               Ned stands, paces, agitated... plants his foot on the chair 
               again. He leans toward her... getting tough again.

                                     NED
                         Alright, quit playing games with us!
                              (fires questions)
                         Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get 
                         the gun? What's your link with the 
                         CIA?

                                     LANA
                         I...

               Ned jumps in, motioning with his hands for this to stop.

                                     NED
                         Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I 
                         will not tolerate this unwarranted 
                         badgering of my client. She'll have 
                         her day in court, gentlemen.

               He slams his briefcase shut and turns to Lana, sincere.

                                     NED
                         I want to thank you, Mrs. Ravine, 
                         for being so cooperative with these 
                         gentlemen.
                              (turns to Laura)
                         Did you get all that down, Laura. 
                         Every word she said?

                                     LAURA
                         Yep. Both of 'em.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

               The CAMERA MOVES IN to a wire mesh cage at the very back of 
               the yard. A small sign on it says: NED JUNIOR. The door is 
               open. The cage is... empty!

               EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY

               Lola rides the roller coaster with Lana's pet Skunk. She 
               LAUGHS maniacally as they plunge down a steep grade!

               The Skunk stands stiffly on her lap, his paws planted on the 
               guard rail, eyes bulging out!... his fur standing straight 
               up!

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - DAY

               Ned hesitates at the front door. It's open a crack. He moves 
               inside cautiously. There is a strange BUBBLING SOUND coming 
               from the kitchen. He moves toward it... apprehensive.

               He enters the kitchen and SEES... a huge bubbling pot on the 
               stove, foam spilling over from under the lid! His mind reels! 
               He charges out the back door.

               EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - DAY

               Ned bursts out the back door... CAMERA TRACKING with his 
               feet as he dashes across the huge back yard... MUSIC POUNDING!

               He SEES the EMPTY animal cage! The door is open. A fuzzy 
               blanket hangs halfway out.

               Shocked, Ned spins around... running back toward the house... 
               CAMERA TRACKING HIS FEET, struggling to keep up. The CAMERA 
               SLAMS into a tree!... CRACKING the LENS!

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - DAY

               Ned bursts in... SEES the bubbling pot!... a huge butcher 
               knife on the counter!... and LOLA, arms outstretched to greet 
               him.

                                     NED
                         NO!

                                     LOLA
                         Yes.

                                     NED
                         NOOOOO!

                                     LOLA
                         Yes!

                                     NED
                         NOOOOOOOooooooo!!!

               She whips the cover off the bubbling pot.

                                     LOLA
                         YES! Cappelini pomodoro!

                                     NED
                         What?

               She lifts up pasta with a spaghetti spoon... tossing a sprig 
               of basil into the pot from the basil-leaf crown she wears.

                                     LOLA
                         Pasta with tomato sauce. Whatsa matta? 
                         You don't like Italian?

                                     NED
                         Where's Ned Junior? WHERE IS HE?!

                                     LOLA
                         I thought he might like to get out, 
                         so I took him to the amusement park.

               He grabs Lola's arm and drags her toward the front door.

                                     NED
                         You can't just break into my house, 
                         cook my food... borrow my skunk!
                              (opens the door)
                         Leave me alone. Stay out of my face! 
                         Out of my neighborhood! Out of my 
                         LIFE!

               She steps outside... turns to him.

                                     LOLA
                         You haven't seen the last of me, 
                         Ned.

               He SLAMS the door in her face... hesitates a beat, curious... 
               then pulls the door open. Lola's still there.

                                     LOLA
                         I told you.

               Ned SLAMS the door again.

               EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY

               It's a media circus! Vendors sell "TRIAL BALLOON" balloons.

               PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS cluster around a squad of CHEERLEADERS 
               wearing sweaters emblazoned with "FREE LANA OR BUST!" across 
               their chests.

               They perform a rousing CHEER in front of a sign on the 
               building that reads... "LE COURTHOUSE".

                                     CHEERLEADERS
                              (with choreography)

               A BBC COMMENTATOR speaks to a TV camera.

                                     COMMENTATOR
                         Once again, Americans are making a 
                         mockery of their courts, turning a 
                         murder trial into a media circus! 
                         How can justice ever prevail when it 
                         is ridiculed and reviled in such a 
                         heinously revolting manner? This is 
                         Clement Von Franckenstein returning 
                         you to our BBC studios in London for 
                         the latest photographs of Lady Di 
                         naked in the bath.

               Ned and Laura push their way through the crush of REPORTERS.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Spectators pour through several turnstiles, shoving in their 
               tokens. TV cameras have been set up to broadcast the trial.

               A UNIFORMED THEATER USHER escorts JURY MEMBERS in, checks 
               their tickets, hands them programs and directs them to their 
               seats.

               Ned and Laura sit at the defense table, next to Lana... who 
               is oblivious to everything, deeply engrossed in a pocket 
               video game. Ned looks toward the gallery and does a disturbed 
               take.

               It's Lola!... sitting in the back row wearing a tailored 
               suit, large brimmed hat with dark veil... and a SKUNK SKIN 
               STOLE draped around her shoulders!

               Dizzy sits next to her, playing softly on a MUTED SAX.

               Laura is on the stand. Ned hands her a sheet of paper.

                                     NED
                         And can you tell us what this is?

                                     LAURA
                         Yes. It's a death threat that Max 
                         Shady FAXED to you on the day he was 
                         released from prison.

               Ned snatches it back, pacing, folding it into a paper 
               airplane.

                                     NED
                         A FAX in which he threatened to puree 
                         certain parts of my anatomy in a 
                         blender! I'd like to submit this 
                         into evidence.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                              (jumps up)
                         Objection! Who cares about the FAX 
                         in this case?

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         I'll allow it.

               Ned sails the paper plane toward the COURT CLERK, who is at 
               an evidence table already piled high with tagged guns, 
               appliances, knickknacks, auto parts and other junk.

               The plane sails toward an open window. The Clerk grabs it... 
               going OUT the window with the plane!

               EXT. COURTHOUSE LAWN - DAY

               The Cheerleaders lead the SPECTATORS in an exuberant CHEER.

                                     CHEERLEADERS
                         U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi! 
                         You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A-
                         M-A! How you think you got that way? 
                         Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama!

               In the b.g., the Court Clerk plummets to the ground, then 
               staggers to his feet, and stumbles... dazed... back toward 
               the courthouse.

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               One of the JURORS watches a "DICK VAN DYKE" re-run on a small 
               portable TV monitors, oblivious to the testimony. In the 
               b.g., the battered Clerk stumbles back in with the paper 
               plane. The Conductor is on the stand. Ned holds up a BLENDER.

                                     NED
                         And is this the blender you found in 
                         the lavatory of the train?

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Yes... it is.

                                     NED
                         I'd like this marked as evidence.

               The Bailiff reaches out, Ned waves him off... instead, tossing 
               the blender over several heads to the Court Clerk... who 
               runs to catch it, CRASHING into the wall. The blender falls, 
               SHATTERS.

                         Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's 
                         check out the re-play.

               On the RE-PLAY SCREEN we see the action repeated in SLOW 
               MOTION as the Sportscaster draws lines, circles, x's and 
               squiggles.

                         Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide 
                         open! But instead of handing it off, 
                         Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh! 
                         The pass is wide! A real wobbler! 
                         There's no way! He scrambles, but he 
                         just can't get his hands on it... 
                         And RIGHT THERE!...
                              (freezes the frame)
                         ...WHAM! That blender is gone!

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               At the defense table, Laura glances over at Lana, who is 
               casually browsing through a copy of GALS & GUNS magazine. 
               Laura reacts, then, trying to be as diplomatic as possible...

                                     LAURA
                         Ned... did you ever consider that 
                         maybe you don't know women as well 
                         as you think you do?

                                     PROSECUTOR (O.S.)
                         Now would you tell the court, in 
                         your own words, what you said to Mr. 
                         Ravine?

               They both look toward the witness stand. Ned is shaken.

                                     NED
                              (whispers)
                         I'm really worried about this guy. 
                         He could blow our whole case right 
                         out of the water.

               Jeff, the little boy from the train is on the witness stand. 
               The Prosecutor stands by, listening as...

                              (singing)

                         gopher guts... and me without a spoon!

               The JURORS turn pale and reach for the air sickness bags in 
               front of them. The Courtroom erupts. The Judge pounds his 
               gavel LOUDLY.

                                     JEFF
                              (pointing at Lana)
                         That lady paid me two bucks to sing 
                         it to him...!

               But NO ONE hears this in all the confusion. The Judge, also 
               looking ill now, bangs his gavel again.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY

                         defensive play of the afternoon.

               INT. COURTROOM - SAME TIME

               Mrs. Shady is on the stand. Ned paces.

                                     NED
                         Mrs. Shady... would you tell us about 
                         your son, Max. Was he a... a good 
                         boy?

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         He was the best. And that's not just 
                         a mother talking. You can ask anybody.

                                     NED
                         But he got into trouble once in 
                         awhile... like all kids do?

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Well, you know, pranks. Little jokes 
                         and things. But he was so cute. I 
                         have pictures!

               She reaches down into her huge purse, pulling out a photo 
               album. She opens it, showing Ned.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Here. This is when he set the cat on 
                         fire...
                              (then, assuring him)
                         Oh... but the cat deserved it.

                                     NED
                              (looks, points)
                         And what, uh... what are these...?

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Marshmallows. He just loved to toast 
                         marshmallows over a roaring cat. 
                         Burned on the outside... all soft in 
                         the middle.
                              (turns page)
                         And right here... this was taken on 
                         the day he left the priesthood to 
                         join the Green Berets.

               They rise slowly out of their seats, craning their necks, 
               trying to see the photos.

               Ned is now seated next to Mrs. Shady in the witness box, 
               looking at the photo album with her. Judge Skanky peers over 
               the side of the bench.

                                     NED
                         This is cute.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                              (laughs, delighted)
                         Oh yes! That was during his Ku Klux 
                         Klan phase. He would take the sheets 
                         right off my bed... cut those little 
                         holes in them. What a stitch he was!

               are now on their feet, all straining to catch a glimpse of 
               the photos in the album.

                         tools... fixing his bike?

               She snatches the photo out of the album.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Why that shouldn't even be in there! 
                         It's his rotten little half-brother.
                              (rips up photo)
                         Stinkin' little pecker... he never 
                         was any good...

               The Sportscaster is pushing his face against the broadcast 
               booth glass, trying to see what everyone's looking at.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     MRS. SHADY
                              (points at another)
                         Oh! I didn't like these neo-Nazi 
                         boys. They were all so fussy and 
                         persnickety about everything. Heil 
                         this and heil that.
                              (flips the page)
                         Oh look... here's Max with his 
                         chainsaw. He loved to go to the 
                         national park and cut down those 
                         giant old trees. It made him feel so 
                         patriotic. You know, if he hadn't 
                         been such a successful criminal... I 
                         think he would have been a lumberjack.

               The Court Clerk, Bailiff and Court Recorder have all moved 
               around behind the witness stand, peering over Mrs. Shady's 
               shoulder at the photos.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                              (tearful, angry)
                         But now he'll never be anything! Not 
                         since...
                              (stands up, points)
                         ...that woman, your wife, pulled the 
                         trigger and put my little Max in his 
                         grave!

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Mrs. Shady! Do not POINT your finger 
                         in my courtroom. It's discourteous, 
                         impolite and disrespectful.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Don't you tell me what to do with my 
                         finger! It's been more places than 
                         you've ever dreamed of!

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                              (bangs gavel)
                         Sit down!

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         I'll point my finger wherever I want!

               Mrs. Shady goes berserk... leaping from the witness stand, 
               pointing several different fingers at Judge Skanky.

               The Bailiff attempts to restrain her, but she breaks free... 
               scurrying around the courtroom, pointing fingers at everyone!

               CHAOS prevails!

               The Irritable Man from the train is on the stand... Max's 
               huge cigar stuck in his ear! The hair around his ear is 
               scorched.

                                     NED
                         Did you encounter the victim... Max 
                         Shady... on board the train?

                                     IRRITABLE MAN
                         Yeah. And I told him... "this is the 
                         NO SMOKING car! Would you please put 
                         out your damn cigar!"

                                     NED
                         And is that the cigar in your ear?

               The Man strains to see the cigar out of the corner of his 
               eye. Impatient, Ned finally holds up a small pocket mirror.

                                     IRRITABLE MAN
                         I believe it is.

                                     NED
                         I'd like the cigar and the head of 
                         this witness entered into evidence.

               The Bailiff picks up the Irritable Man and dumps him on the 
               evidence table, where he is tagged by the Court Clerk.

                                     NED
                         The defense calls... Lana Ravine!

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               Lana is on the stand. The Bailiff swears her in.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Do you swear to tell the truth, the 
                         whole truth and nothing but the truth 
                         so help you God?

                                     LANA
                              (looks to Judge)
                         Do I have to answer that, Harlan?

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         No, no dear. I'll vouch for her.

               Ned approaches.

                                     NED
                         Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you 
                         Lana?

                                     LANA
                         No. Call me Angel Tits.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         I object!

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Sustained. Counselor... you will 
                         address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine.

                                     NED
                              (after a beat)
                         Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell 
                         the court... what were you doing on 
                         that train?

                                     LANA
                         I saw Max Shady at the station... 
                         saw him get on board. I knew he'd 
                         made threats to kill you and mutilate 
                         your reproductive organs...

               Ned and EVERY MALE in the courtroom winces at this, doubling 
               over in imagined agony. Lana pauses, then continues...

                                     LANA
                         ...so I got on the train too... so I 
                         could warn you.

                                     NED
                         Do you want to have children?

                                     LANA
                         Someday. With the right man.

                         But you couldn't have children if 
                         my...
                              (makes a gesture)

                                     LANA
                         It would be difficult.

                                     NED
                         So you followed him, knowing you had 
                         to protect me... your husband... 
                         your best friend... the man you 
                         love... the future father of your 
                         children.

                         And when you saw that maniac standing 
                         in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize 
                         my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and 
                         fired and fired and FIRED!

                         fired and fired and fired and fired...

               She pauses to count off on her fingers, then...

                         ...and fired and fired and fired.

                         The defense rests, your Honor.

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               The COURTROOM ARTIST has been sketching intensely throughout 
               the trial. We finally see... he's been sketching a BOWL OF 
               FRUIT on the Court Recorder's desk. Ned picks up some fruit 
               from the bowl and approaches the defense table.

                                     NED
                         How can you convict a courageous 
                         woman who risked everything to save 
                         the life of her beloved husband? A 
                         woman who acted boldly to stop a 
                         demented maniac from doing THIS!...

               Ned shoves the BANANA and two PLUMS into a demonstration 
               blender on the defense table. He hits the puree button and 
               the blender WHIRRS loudly!

                                     NED
                              (shouts over)
                         ...pulverizing the private parts of 
                         the man she loves!

               All MALES in the courtroom react with pained expressions, 
               cringing and doubling-over. Ned turns the blender off.

                                     NED

                         child. I challenge YOU to strike a 
                         blow for motherhood and the American 
                         justice system! Put the "con" back

                         back in American. And put the "dom" 
                         back in freedom. Find this woman 
                         INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed 
                         happy tonight!

               INT. PRESS ROOM - LATER

               A REPORTER opens the door marked PRESS ROOM. Inside, a DOZEN 
               REPORTERS press their pants on a dozen ironing boards.

                                     REPORTER
                         The jury's back!

               The Reporters scramble for the door, pulling their pants on!

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               The CAMERA FOLLOWS a folded piece of paper as the Jurors 
               pass it along to the FOREMAN... who hands it to the Bailiff... 
               who hands it to the Judge. He unfolds it, reads it... then 
               winks flirtatiously at the FEMALE JUROR who wrote it. She 
               blushes.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                              (back to business)
                         So... has the jury reached a verdict?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                              (stands up)
                         Yes we have, your Honor.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         How do you find the defendant... on 
                         the count of manslaughter?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         Not guilty.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         On the count of murder in the first 
                         degree?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         Not guilty.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         On the Count of Monte Cristo?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         Not guilty.

               A BOISTEROUS CLAMOR in the court. The electronic signs FLASH 
               "NOT GUILTY!"... "NOT GUILTY!"... "NOT GUILTY!"

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Good. Then on the count of three, 
                         let's all get the hell out of here! 
                         One... two...

               The Jury and Spectators start to rise. The Judge hesitates, 
               gavel poised, shooting them a warning look.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Wait... for... it...

               Everyone FREEZES halfway out of their seats... waiting.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Two and a half... THREE!

               He smacks his gavel. Everyone scatters for the doors, but 
               Judge Skanky beats them out of the room.

               Lana turns cool, dropping her courtroom facade. She plucks 
               off her earrings, unbuttons the neck of her dress, reaches 
               in and magically pulls out her bra, tossing it away.

                                     LANA
                         Well, counselor, looks like you won 
                         another case. Lucky for me.

               TWO LEGAL AIDES sneak up behind Ned and dump a big plastic 
               barrel of Gatorade cans over his head!

                                     BAILIFF (O.S.)
                              (over P. A. system)
                         Attention courtroom shoppers! All 
                         trial evidence now on sale. Forty to 
                         sixty percent off all exhibits! 
                         Everything must go!

               They turn to SEE: Spectators and Jurors browse through the 
               clutter of junk in front of the Court Clerk on the evidence 
               table. An IRRITABLE WOMAN claims the Irritable Man, grabbing 
               the cigar from his ear and throwing it down.

                                     IRRITABLE WOMAN
                         I told you, Bernard... smoking cigars 
                         is bad for your hearing!

               She pulls him away as Lana steps up, with a cigarette dangling 
               from her lips. Lana picks up her gun and spins the cylinder. 
               It's loaded. The battered Court Clerk limps over, smiling.

                                     COURT CLERK
                         Mrs. Ravine! What can I do for ya?

                                     LANA
                         How much for my gun?

               Laura sees this... turns to Ned with a look of shock.

                                     LAURA
                         I don't believe it! She just bought 
                         her gun back! The gun she used to 
                         kill a man!

               Ned looks off toward Lana with admiration.

                                     NED
                         Yeah... the same gun that saved my 
                         life. I'm sure it has sentimental 
                         value.

               As Lana wades into the crowd of REPORTERS, some still without 
               pants, the CAMERA MOVES TO Lola, who is watching Lana from 
               the back of the courtroom.

               Lola pulls a small cord hanging from the side of her hat... 
               opening her veil like window drapes. She's not happy.

               INT. FRANK'S GARAGE - DAY

               Frank lays on a mechanic's "creeper", working under a car. 
               Lana steps between his feet. He hears her and rolls out, his 
               crotch sliding to a stop against her legs. He looks up, 
               covered with black grease.

                                     FRANK
                         So... you did it. Ya beat the rap.

                                     LANA
                         No thanks to you.

               He gets to his feet, cocky.

                                     FRANK
                         Hey... I knew he'd spring ya.

               She walks toward him, her voice cold, accusing. He backs up.

                                     LANA
                         You didn't lift a finger, Frank. You 
                         let me take all the heat.

                                     FRANK
                         Heeeee-eeey... what could I do?

               Lana pulls the gun from her purse, pointing it at him.

                                     LANA
                         You were gonna let me rot in the 
                         slammer... never say a thing.

                                     FRANK
                         Look... you're out... free. Now we're 
                         together. That's what counts. We can 
                         try again! Forget triple indemnity. 
                         We'll whack him and split three mil.

                                     LANA
                         I'm not splitting anything, Frank.
                              (cocks the gun)
                         And you know too much.

                                     FRANK
                              (arrogant)
                         Come on, Lana. You're not gonna shoot 
                         me.

               He brashly turns his back to her, putting some tools away. 
               She sees a huge electric powered SCREWDRIVER on the workbench 
               next to her, smiling diabolically. She lowers the gun.

                                     LANA
                         You're right.
                              (then, seductive)
                         Maybe I'll just screw you to death.

               He laughs arrogantly... starts to unbutton his shirt.

                                     FRANK
                         Now you're talkin' baby.

               EXT. THE GARAGE WINDOW - DAY

               We see Lana's SILHOUETTE on the window as she raises the big 
               power screwdriver and turns it on. WHIRR-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R!

               The CAMERA WHIPS AROUND and PUSHES IN TO...

               LOLA

               watching the murder from her car. There is a... FLASH! Then 
               another! And another! We are...

               INT. THE GARAGE - LATER

               A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER takes FLASH pictures of the crime scene. 
               The CORONER, COPS, FORENSIC MEN... all do their thing. Ned 
               and Arch amble in, looking around. Arch is eating Nachos.

                                     FORENSIC MAN
                         Watch your step, guys. There's a lot 
                         of blood.

               Throughout this scene, in the b.g., the milling COPS and 
               INVESTIGATORS slip on all the blood, as if on slick ice, and 
               fall out of frame, their arms and legs flailing helplessly!

               One of the Coroner's INVESTIGATORS approaches Arch and Ned.

                                     INVESTIGATOR
                         Looks like a suicide. We found a 
                         note.

               He holds up a rolled piece of paper with a pair of tweezers. 
               Ned takes it, trying to unroll it.

                                     INVESTIGATOR
                         It was stuck up his nose.

               Ned hands it off to Arch, who casually unrolls it. The 
               Investigator slips, arms waving, and falls out of frame.

                                     ARCH
                              (reading it)
                         "I can't take it anymore. I'm a 
                         mediocre mechanic... and a lousy 
                         lover."

                                     NED
                         He's sure got that right.

               Arch gives Ned a very strange look. Ned feels his stare.

                                     NED
                         The "mechanic" part, I mean.

               In the b.g., various COPS pair up to have their pictures 
               taken by the Police Crime Scene Photographer... posing, 
               grinning.

                                     NED
                              (stares at the body)
                         I don't know why, Arch, but I just 
                         can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't 
                         suicide.

               THE CAMERA MOVES

               behind Ned on his line, revealing Frank... pinned to the 
               wall by the power screwdriver stuck in his back! It's still 
               running... vibrating with a GRINDING HUM.

               Ned reaches out and turns the screwdriver OFF.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - DAY

               Ned enters, pausing. He hears VOICES. He goes to the living 
               room. Lana and Lola turn to see him in the doorway. He is 
               shocked. Lana looks shaken. But Lola is cool... in control.

                                     LANA
                         Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um...

                                     NED
                              (nervous, defensive)
                         Um? She told you her name was Um? 
                         And what other lies did she tell 
                         you? I've never seen this woman in 
                         my life! Never followed her home! 
                         Never had sex with her in the 
                         refrigerator! It's all a sick 
                         fantasy... and I deny everything!

               He turns to Lola.

                                     NED
                         When will women like you learn, you 
                         can't tear apart a perfectly good 
                         marriage with your vicious lies... 
                         Miss UMMMM!

                                     LOLA
                         Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith. 
                         I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine. 
                         The big powerful kind that suck up 
                         everything in sight. I was just 
                         telling your wife, if she wants to 
                         get rid of all her dirt, she has to 
                         be willing to pay the price.

               She turns to Lana with a cold and contemptuous glare.

                                     LOLA
                         Let me know what you decide, Mrs. 
                         Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a 
                         convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure 
                         meeting you... Ned.

               Lola exits. As soon as the door closes, Lana whirls around 
               in a fury!... SMASHING a lamp! She SHRIEKS furiously!

                                     LANA
                         I... hate... SALESMEN!

               He puts his arms around her, comforting.

                                     NED
                         I know it's been a tough ordeal... 
                         with the trial and everything. Tell 
                         you what... let's take a trip.

                                     LANA
                         A trip?

                                     NED
                         Yeah. Just the two of us.

                                     LANA
                              (darkly inspired)
                         I like that. Just you and me... all 
                         alone. I'll start packing.

                                     NED
                         Great. Listen... I got something to 
                         take care of. I'll be back in awhile.

               He kisses her and exits. Lana turns to look up toward the 
               landing, a vengefully insane smile clouding her face.

               INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - DUSK

               A demanding KNOCK at the door. Lola hesitates at the door.

                                     LOLA
                         Who is it?

               The door CRASHES OPEN! Ned is silhouetted in the doorway. He 
               looks really pissed! Lola turns and runs. Ned sprints after 
               her, leaping through the air... bringing her down with a 
               tackle!

                                     NED
                         I just want to talk.

                                     LOLA
                         Why didn't you say so?

               Her foot shoots out, smashing him right in the face... WHAM! 
               She jumps up and scrambles away. Ned pursues her. She grabs 
               a bottle of scotch from the counter, spins around.

                                     LOLA
                         Would you like a drink?

               She throws the bottle! He ducks and it shatters on the wall!

                                     NED
                         No thanks. I'm driving.

               She whirls on one foot, nailing him in the head with a FLYING 
               SPIN KICK! He stumbles back, dazed. She grabs an ice pick.

                                     LOLA
                         Then let's get to the point!

               Lola charges! Ned rolls onto his back, jamming both feet 
               into her stomach, heaving her up over him... thru the air! 
               She SLAMS into the wall!... then slowly turns... still cool 
               and collected. She raises a cigarette... lights it with the 
               ice pick "lighter."

                                     LOLA
                         So what's your problem, tough guy?

                                     NED
                         Stay away from my life, my wife, my 
                         home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on 
                         a vacation and when I come back, I 
                         don't ever want to see your face 
                         again!

               He shoves her against the wall... the cigarette flying away.

                                     LOLA
                              (shocked)
                         A VACATION! She doesn't deserve a 
                         VACATION! She's a brat! A bad girl! 
                         She always was and always will be!

               He grabs her by the shoulders, shaking her.

                                     NED

                         know anything about Lana?

                         you? TELL ME!

               She clams up. He slaps her.

                                     NED
                         Who is she!

                                     LOLA
                         She's your wife!

                         She's your wife!

               He raises his hand to slap her hard.

                                     NED
                         WHO IS SHE!

               She SLAPS him!

                                     LOLA
                         She's my sister!

               She continues to slap him... back and forth... repeating her 
               answers... "She's your wife"... "She's my sister!"... "Your 
               wife!"... "My sister!"... "Wife!"... "Sister!"

               He reaches a boiling point, raising two fingers, preparing 
               to give her the Three Stooges "two-fingered eye poke." She 
               blocks it with her hand and shoves him away. Then, she 
               executes a perfect Three Stooges "wiggly-hand head slap", 
               telling him...

                                     LOLA
                         She's your wife... AND my sister!

               Ned is stunned. MUSIC THUNDERS dramatically! Lana clicks the 
               stereo off. The MUSIC STOPS.

                                     LOLA
                         She was spoiled rotten! She stole

                         Including him.

                         Dwayne. The boy's gym teacher. He 
                         was older. So mature... so strong. 
                         He smelled like dirty sweat socks 
                         and old basketballs. And he was all 
                         mine. For awhile.
                              (turning bitter)
                         But Lana wasn't satisfied with her 
                         own things. She had to have mine 
                         too. She took it all... my makeup, 
                         my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear...

                         I had fifty-three operations. When 
                         the doctors were finished with me... 
                         I looked like THIS! I'm ugly. UGLY!

                         Tell that to Dwayne. When he saw my 
                         face, he left me for HER... because 
                         she looked more like me than I did! 
                         First she stole my looks... then she 
                         stole the only man who ever loved 
                         me!

               She comes toward him... feeling in control once more.

                         marriage!

                         me... harrassed me... the tape...

                         murdered that greasy auto mechanic.

                         Yeah. Why? Did he burn you on car 
                         repairs too?

                         Dwayne's name was Kelbo. He had a 
                         son. Frankie Kelbo.

               INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT

               Ned wanders to his car, climbs in, sits there... stunned.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         The pieces of the puzzle were falling 
                         into place and I didn't like the 
                         picture they were making. If Lana 
                         really killed Frank Kelbo, then I 
                         had misjudged her by a mile. Sure... 
                         he was a lousy mechanic. But murder?

               Ned rubs his temples, shuts his eyes.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         It was all starting to give me a 
                         headache bigger than the national 
                         deficit.

               INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" plays on the stereo. Lola sits on the 
               floor by an end table, eyes dazed, staring blankly. A lamp 
               with a "clapper" switch sits on the table.

               As the CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY to her, she absently "claps" 
               the light off... then on... then off... then on... then off...

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON female hands using a keyhole saw to cut through a 
               railing on the second floor landing above the foyer.

               Outside... the SOUND of a car... headlights! The sawing stops.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ned pulls up. The house is dark and ominous. So is the MUSIC.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The front door is open a crack. He cautiously pushes it and 
               the door CR-E-A-K-S open very slowly. The door STOPS, but 
               the LOUD CREAKING continues. Ned touches it lightly with the 
               tip of his finger. The CREAKING STOPS.

                                     NED
                         Lana?

               Ned moves up the stairs. The CAMERA BOOMS UP with him, HOLDING 
               ON an ECU of the partially severed railing.

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Ned enters. Hot water gushes from the faucet into a clawfoot 
               bathtub. He turns the water off, looking around, puzzled.

               Loosens his tie, rubs his head. A splitting headache. Opens 
               the medicine cabinet and... SCREECH! YEOW! CRASH! A CAT leaps 
               out!... darts away. There's a NOISE from downstairs.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

               Someone is POUNDING on the door. Ned enters and opens it. 
               It's Laura.

                                     LAURA
                         Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so 
                         much to tell you.

                                     NED
                         Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab 
                         a chair.

                                     LAURA
                         Thanks... I brought my own.

               She drags a chair in behind her, sits at the kitchen table. 
               Ned puts a kettle on the burner, turns it on. He starts 
               searching through the cupboard for teabags.

                                     NED
                         So... what have you got?

                                     LAURA
                         A lottery ticket and a laundry 
                         receipt.
                              (lays them on table)
                         I found them in the pocket of that 
                         suit you wore the night you were 
                         working under cover with a client.

               Ned freezes, staring out the window, unable to face her.

                                     LAURA
                         You remember that night, don't ya 
                         Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts 
                         with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L-
                         O... L-A. Lola.

               Ned turns to her when he hears Lola's name... looking baffled 
               by this convoluted piece of logic.

                                     LAURA
                              (shrugs it off)
                         Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's 
                         mind works.

               He turns back to the cupboard, picking up a container.

                                     NED
                         How about Ovaltine?

                                     LAURA
                         Fine. Then I remembered you told me 
                         some guy named Frank had been working 
                         on your wife's car for two months. 
                         You with me so far?

                                     NED
                         I'm way ahead of you.

               He brings the Ovaltine container to the table.

                                     LAURA
                         Well back it up. You probably took a 
                         wrong turn. Remember your insurance 
                         policy... the one we couldn't find? 
                         I started thinking, who else had 
                         access to it beside you and me? The 
                         answer came up... Lana. And since 
                         she's a woman, it's probably hidden 
                         right here.

               A huge ceramic cookie jar sits on the table in front of them. 
               Laura SMASHES it with her fist, breaking it open! Cookies 
               spill out... and the insurance policy.

                                     NED
                         So that's where she hid the Oreos.

               He sits down... starts eating Oreos... twisting them apart.

                                     LAURA
                         Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your 
                         life when she shot Max Shady. She 
                         and Frank were plotting to kill you 
                         and collect on your insurance policy. 
                         But she shot the wrong guy.

                                     NED
                         That's the craziest thing I ever 
                         heard.

                                     LAURA
                              (she presses on)
                         Don't you see... Frank was going to 
                         let her take the fall. So she murdered 
                         him and tried to make it look like 
                         suicide.
                              (beat)
                         That's when I realized there was a 
                         connection between Lola and Lana...

                                     NED
                         Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters.

                                     LAURA
                         Well, hang on to your jock strap, 
                         Ned. There's more.

               She unrolls a complex genealogical chart... walks him thru 
               it.

                                     LAURA
                         Not only is Frank's father Dwayne 
                         Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher 
                         and Lola Cain's former lover... 
                         Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max 
                         and Frank are half-brothers who never 
                         met.

               Laura pauses dramatically, then announces.

                                     LAURA
                         Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered 
                         both of Helen Shady's sons.

                                     NED
                         This is so unbelievable.

                                     LAURA
                         And you haven't even heard my story.

               INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT

               The keyhole saw cuts through the railing. The CAMERA REVEALS 
               Lana, eyes filled with Machiavellian rage.

               She enters the bathroom, lays the saw blade down. Suddenly... 
               a PAIR OF HANDS plunge into frame, grabbing her by the throat!

               We GO WITH HER as she is pushed back into the tub, the hands 
               forcing her head under water. Lana grabs a diving mask, clamps 
               it over her face. One of the attacking hands rips it away! 
               Lana grabs a snorkel, sticking it in her mouth. The hand 
               pulls it from her, tossing it aside.

               The hand shoves a little RUBBER DUCKIE into Lana's mouth! 
               Lana struggles, finally going limp. Her open eyes stare up 
               from beneath the water. The last few bubbles rise to the 
               surface.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

                                     LAURA
                         He turned into a monster. And that's 
                         when I left him. I just couldn't...

               The tea kettle WHISTLES! Laura pulls it off the burner. The 
               whistling subsides... replaced by the distant SOUND of water 
               running upstairs. Ned cocks his head, listening.

                                     NED
                         That damn faucet keeps turning on 
                         all by itself. I'll go check it.

                                     LAURA
                         Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine.

               Ned exits. Laura opens the Ovaltine container. It's empty. A 
               DARK SHADOW moves past the window behind Laura. Suspense 
               MUSIC. Laura opens the cupboard. PIGEONS explode out, wings 
               beating furiously! She catches her breath, looks in the 
               cupboard. The cans and boxes are covered with pigeon shit. 
               She shoves them aside, looking for the Ovaltine.

               INT. FOYER - SAME TIME

               Ned looks up toward the light from the bathroom. Water seeps 
               over the edge of the landing and down the steps. As he moves 
               up the steps, the SOUND of MUSIC... the familiar strains of 
               "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"... grows louder and LOUDER.

               INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

               It's filled with steam. He waves the steam away... STARTLED 
               to see Lana's lifeless body beneath the water, the rubber 
               duckie jammed into her mouth. The tub overflows on the floor.

               He turns the faucet off. The water stops... and so does the 
               MUSIC. Puzzled, he turns the faucet on. The MUSIC STARTS. 
               Turns it off. The MUSIC STOPS.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               As Laura turns away to enter the pantry... her Husband's 
               twisted face suddenly appears in the kitchen window!

               INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME

               Ned enters. The MUSIC is coming from the closet. Ned yanks 
               the door open! A flock of PIGEONS bursts out!... revealing a 
               GUEST MUSICIAN playing an instrument.

                                     GUEST MUSICIAN
                         I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a 
                         gig tonight.

               Ned shuts the door, eyes shifting. Lola must be near.

               INT. PANTRY OFF KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura searches the large walk-in pantry for tea bags. She 
               hears a LOUD CRASH of BREAKING GLASS in the kitchen... stops 
               and listens... then casually shrugs it off.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura's Husband stands in the kitchen. The back door is 
               open... the window shattered. He SEES... the kitchen towels 
               hanging sloppily on the rack! The disorganized clutter of 
               cans and boxes in the cupboard! WE PUSH IN to his wildly 
               insane eyes!

               INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME

               As Ned enters the upstairs landing, we hear VOICES in his 
               mind.

                                     NED
                              (ECHOING V.O.)
                         Women are an open book. You can always 
                         tell the rotten apples from the 
                         peaches. I'd stake my career on it... 
                         stake my career on it... stake my 
                         career on it...

               The repetitive ECHO gets to him. He smacks his head with the 
               palm of his hand. The skipping stops... followed by...

                                     NED
                              (ECHOING V.O.)
                         ...If anyone ever proves me wrong, 
                         I'll throw away my badge.

               IN THE DARKNESS

               A woman's HAND unrolls a leather kit... the "U-Pick an Ice 
               Pick Porta-Pik-Pak!"... with seven ice picks in separate 
               slots, each labeled with a day of the week.

               The hand selects "Wednesday's" ice pick, pulls it out. Then... 
               BONG... BONG... BONG... BONG...!

               CANTED ANGLE ON - A GRANDFATHER CLOCK

               It CHIMES loudly. It's twelve midnight!

               THE HAND

               returns the ice pick to its slot, selects the one for 
               Thursday.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura comes out of the pantry. She stops... gasps! Everything 
               in the cupboard is neatly stacked! All the towels are 
               straight!

               She whirls around... coming face to face with her Husband! 
               He smiles demonically, holding up the Ninja Turtle float 
               ring.

                                     LAURA'S HUSBAND
                         Forget something, sweetheart?

               INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME

               Ned nears the bathroom door and suddenly... A PIERCING SCREAM! 
               Lola charges, an ice pick raised over her head! She knocks 
               him backward, into the bathroom, slashing at him. But he 
               deflects the attack, grabbing at her arms.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura backs away from her Husband. He holds her wedding ring.

                                     LAURA'S HUSBAND
                         You forgot to flush, darling.

               INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME

               As Ned and Lola continue their violent struggle... Lola grabs 
               toiletries to aid in her attack. She squirts Ned with SHAVING 
               CREAM... squeezes TOOTHPASTE in his hair... and throws BATH 
               POWDER in his face!

               Ned is blinded. Gaining the advantage, Lola shoves him back, 
               slamming his head into the wall. He's dazed, helpless.

               Lola raises the ice pick, moving forward to strike! But Ned 
               grabs a HAIR BLOWER and swings it around, pointing it at her 
               like a gun! She freezes... then smiles contemptuously.

                                     LOLA
                         What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me 
                         away?

               She LAUGHS arrogantly. Ned clicks on the hair blower to HIGH, 
               a blast of HOT AIR hitting Lola's face, puffing her cheeks 
               out, pushing her back, hair flying wildly!

               Her backside hits the railing where Lana has cut it... the 
               wood splintering!

               Lola tumbles over backward, SCREAMING! She hangs suspended 
               in mid-air for a moment, like a cartoon character, arms 
               flailing. Then... WHOOM!... she FALLS to the marble floor 
               below, hitting with a LOUD THUD!

               INT. THE KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura's Husband hears Lola fall, turning. Laura grabs the 
               iron skillet and CLOBBERS him with it! BONG! He goes down.

                                     LAURA
                         I never forget anything... honey.

               INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME

               Ned stares at the hair blower in his hand. Filled with disgust 
               and revulsion, he throws the "weapon" down.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura pulls TWO REVOLVERS from her purse... spinning them 
               like John Wayne... expertly tossing one over her back, 
               catching it in front! She heads for the foyer.

               INT. FOYER - A MOMENT LATER - ON LOLA'S BODY

               Laura pauses, looks down at Lola's body... notices something. 
               She pushes Lola's skirt a bit higher with the toe of her 
               shoe.

                                     LAURA
                              (outraged)
                         Those are MY panties!

               She looks up... sees a light emanating from the bathroom.

               ON THE LANDING

               Laura moves through the shadows... stops outside the bathroom, 
               pressing her back against the wall, guns up and ready.

               She swivels into the doorway... taking a shooter's stance... 
               guns pointed! She sees... LANA... submerged in the tub, face 
               up, the rubber duckie in her mouth.

               Laura steps back and turns... right into a THING covered in 
               white! Startled, she SHRIEKS! Ned drops the white towel he's 
               using to wipe off all of the shaving cream and toothpaste. 
               Relieved to see it's Ned, she throws her arms around him!

                                     LAURA
                         Oh Ned!

                                     NED
                         You were right... there's a million 
                         things I don't know about women. 
                         Maybe you can teach me a few hundred.

               He pulls out his police badge, looks at it.

                                     NED
                         Hell... I had too many careers anyway.

               He tosses it away, over the railing.

               INT. FOYER - ECU LOLA - SAME TIME

               The badge drops from above, landing on the floor right in 
               front of Lola's lifeless face. A beat. Her eyes pop open!

               INT. BATHROOM - ECU ON BATH WATER - SAME TIME

               Suddenly, the rubber duckie pops to the surface.

               ON THE LANDING

               Laura hugs Ned again, arms locked around his neck, still 
               gripping a gun in each hand.

                                     LAURA
                         Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved 
                         you!

               INT. FOYER

               Lola sits bolt upright, bloody but still bouncy.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Lana suddenly SITS UP in the tub, inhaling a huge GASP of 
               air, her eyes wild!

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Laura's Husband's eyes POP OPEN! He SITS UP suddenly... 
               smashing his head into the sharp corner of the kitchen table! 
               He topples back slowly... really dead! Finally.

               INT. THE STAIRCASE

               Lola's feet move steadily up each stair... her bloody hand 
               grasping the ice pick.

               INT. BATHROOM FLOOR - LOW ANGLE

               Lana's feet step out of the tub, water dripping all around. 
               She picks up the pointed saw from the floor.

               ON THE LANDING

               Ned and Laura still embrace, her forearms crisscrossed behind 
               his neck. It's been a long embrace.

               Suddenly, Lana and Lola both appear, SCREAMING like banshees!

               Lana charges from the bathroom, grasping the sharp saw blade! 
               Lola races at them from the stairway... with the ice pick!

               Without missing a beat, Laura raises the barrels of both 
               guns and FIRES at them simultaneously... right next to Ned's 
               ears.

               The impact of one bullet knocks Lana all the way back through 
               the bathroom, CRASHING spectacularly out the window! The 
               other bullet sends Lola flipping down the staircase!

               Ned looks stunned, his eyes crossed... the thundering gunshots 
               still ringing in his ears. Laura proudly blows the gunsmoke 
               away from the end of each barrel.

                                     LAURA
                         Got 'em!

                                     NED
                              (deafened)
                         WHAT?

                                     LAURA
                         I said... I GOT 'EM!

                                     NED
                         HUH?!!!

                                     LAURA
                              (yells)
                         THEY'RE DEAD! GONE! KA-PUT!

               He strains to make out what she's saying, ears still ringing.

                                     NED
                              (yells back)
                         SURE I'LL MARRY YOU! NEXT TUESDAY 
                         WOULD BE PERFECT!

               A beat. Laura opens her mouth to correct him, then decides 
               against it. She smiles... speaking softly, almost shyly.

                                     LAURA
                         Okay. But I want to have kids.

               He hears THIS... smiles at her.

                                     NED
                         Great.

               They embrace.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - NEAR DAWN

               We MOVE IN SLOWLY toward the house.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         So... maybe I was wrong. Maybe women 
                         really are like a big jigsaw puzzle... 
                         with pieces that never seem to fit 
                         where you want 'em to.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - SAME TIME

               Ned and Laura are in bed, wrapped in each other's arms.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         All I know is, there are three things 
                         that men can't possibly ever do...

               NEW ANGLE - NED AND LAURA

               Revealing that it's NOT "voice over narration." Ned is 
               actually rattling on aloud again.

                                     NED
                         ...understand women... give birth... 
                         and program a VCR. And giving birth 
                         is the easy one.

                                     LAURA
                         Ned...

                                     NED
                         Yeah, Laura?

                                     LAURA
                         Knock off the chatter, will ya?

               He smiles at her. They kiss. Romantic SAXAPHONE MUSIC begins 
               to play... only this time, it's "Laura's Theme."

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY... revealing Dizzy laying on 
               the bed beside them... playing the sax.

               After a beat, Laura turns to Dizzy.

                                     LAURA
                         We won't need you anymore.

               Ned casually slips him a twenty dollar bill. Dizzy slips off 
               the bed and out the door. Laura turns to Ned.

                                     LAURA
                         We can make our own music.

               Her hand reaches slowly over the edge of the bed, toward the 
               floor. Suddenly... she comes up with a CONCERTINA, a small 
               accordian... and begins to play it!

               Ned lays there listening for a few moments, a stunned look 
               frozen on his face. Then... he reaches under the pillow and 
               pulls out a HARMONICA and joins in.

               The CAMERA BOOMS UP to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT... as they play 
               MEDLEY of all the MUSIC heard in the film.

               FADE TO BLACK

               ROLL END CREDITS

               After the final credit, WE HEAR:

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         Ned, do you know... I want you to 
                         make love to me all night long?

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         No. But if you hum a few bars... 
                         I'll fake it.

                                         THE END
FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS

 





              FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS

                           by

              Terry Gilliam & Toy Grisoni




BLACK SCREEN

A desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind
comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters
singing "My Favorite Things." A series of sepia images of
anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after
another on the screen.

In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title
FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A
beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:

TITLE: "He who makes a beast of himself
       Gets rid of the pain
       Of being a man."
       Dr. Johnson

The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:

                         DUKE (V/O)
            We were somewhere around Barstow on
            the edge of the desert when the
            drugs began to take hold.

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black
screen.

EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred
miles an hour.  THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares.

AT THE WHEEL

STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,
BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.

BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND
WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY
UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.

The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths
up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I remember saying something like:
            "I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe
            you should drive..."

GONZO starts shaving.

                                                            2.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Suddenly there was a terrible roar
            all around us and the sky was full
            of what looked like huge bats, all
            swooping and screeching and diving
            around the car...

Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The
reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close
to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            ... and a voice was screaming: Holy
            Jesus!  What are these goddamn
            animals?

CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -

DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.
GONZO casually looks over...

                         GONZO
            What are you yelling about?

DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench
makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.

                         DUKE
            Never mind.  It's your turn to drive.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            No point mentioning these bats.  I
            thought.  The poor bastard will see
            them soon enough.

DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,
frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A
MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles
through the impressive stash.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            We had two bags of grass, seventy-
            five pellets of mescaline, five
            sheets of high powered blotter
            acid, a salt shaker half full of
            cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-
            colored uppers, downers, screamers,
            laughers... Also a quart of tequila,
            a quart of rum, a case of beer, a
            pint of raw ether and two dozen
            amyls.

                                                            3.


DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the
SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with
another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives
back into the car.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Not that we needed all that for the
            trip, but once you get locked into
            a serious drug collection, the
            tendency is to push it as far as
            you can.

THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,
weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A
BAT?

EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

IN THE RED SHARK

GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a
lousy driver.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The only thing that really worried
            me was the ether.  There is nothing
            in the world more helpless and
            irresponsible and depraved than a
            man in the depths of an ether binge.
            And I knew we'd get into that
            rotten stuff pretty soon.

The radio news wars with "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" on a tape
recorder.

                         RADIO NEWS
            An overdose of heroin was listed as
            the official cause of death for
            pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby
            whose body was found stuffed in a
            refrigerator last week...

GONZO changes the station - "ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET
JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE" vies with "SYMPATHY"... He
sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.
The RED SHARK fishtails.

                         GONZO
            "One toke over the line, sweet
            Jesus."

                                                            4.


                         DUKE
                   (muttering to himself)
            One toke.  You poor fool.  Wait
            till you see those goddamn bats.

UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD

A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a
thumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down
the road...

                         GONZO
            Let's give that boy a lift.

GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side
of the road.

                         DUKE
            We can't stop here - this is bat
            country!

GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The
HITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.

                         HITCHHIKER
            Hot damn!  I never rode in a
            convertible before!

Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the
sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-
NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.

                         DUKE
            Is that right?  Well, I guess
            you're about ready, eh?

The HITCHHIKER hesitates.

                         GONZO
            We're your friends.  We're not like
            the others.

                         DUKE
                   (hissing sharply)
            No more of that talk or I'll put
            the leeches on you.

DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.

EXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED
SHARK screams down the road.

                                                            5.


GONZO sings along to the tape player.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out
and taking his chances.

DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear
view mirror.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            How long could we maintain, I
            wondered.  How long before one of
            us starts raving and jabbering at
            this boy?  What will he think then?
            This same lonely desert was the
            last known home of the Manson family.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling
down GONZO's neck.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Would he make that grim connection
            when my attorney starts screaming
            about bats and huge manta rays
            coming down on the car?

DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with
the words, sometimes not.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            If so - well, we'll just have to
            cut his head off and bury him
            somewhere.  Because it goes without
            saying that we can't turn him loose.
            He'd report us at once to some kind
            of outback Nazi law enforcement
            agency, and they'll run us down
            like dogs...

                         DUKE
                   (out loud to himself)
            Jesus!  Did I say that?

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Or just think it?  Was I talking?
            Did they hear me?

                         GONZO
                   (reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)
            It's okay.  He's admiring the shape
            of your skull.

DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER
giggles nervously.

                                                            6.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Maybe I better have a chat with
            this boy I thought.  Perhaps if I
            explain things, he'll rest easy...

                         DUKE
                   (roaring over the
                   road noise)
            THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD
            PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --

The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.

                         DUKE
                   (yells)
            CAN YOU HEAR ME?

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs
into the back seat.

                         DUKE
            That's good.  Because I want you to
            have all the background.  This is a
            very ominous assignment -- with
            overtones of extreme personal
            danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!
            This is important, goddamnit!  This
            is a true story!...
                   (WHACKS the BACK OF
                   THE DRIVER'S SEAT
                   with his fist)


The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.

                         GONZO
                   (screams)
            Keep your hands off my fucking neck!

The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS
HIM BACK DOWN.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Our vibrations were getting nasty --
            but why?  Was there no communication
            in this car?  Had we deteriorated
            to the level of dumb beasts?

The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.

                                                            7.


                         DUKE
                   (to HITCHHIKER)
            I want you to understand that this
            man at the wheel is my attorney!
            He's not just some dingbat I found
            on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I
            think he's probably Samoan.  But it
            doesn't matter, does it?  Are you
            prejudiced?

                         HITCHHIKER
            Hell, no!

                         DUKE
            I didn't think so.  Because in
            spite of his race, this man is
            extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I
            forgot all about this beer.  You
            want one?
                   (HITCHHIKER shakes
                   his head)
            How about some ether?

                         HITCHHIKER
            What?

                         DUKE
            Never mind.  Let's get right to the
            heart of this thing.  Twenty-four
            hours ago we were sitting in the
            Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
            Hotel...

INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY

A uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE
through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They
are the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL
BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore
Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED
VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            ... in the patio section, of
            course, drinking Singapore Slings
            with mescal on the side, hiding
            from the brutish realities of this
            foul year of Our Lord, 1971.

The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and
shades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank
top undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious
conversation.

                                                            8.


                         DUKE
            I'm telling you, the Salazar story
            is getting too complicated.  The
            weasels have started closing in.

The DWARF sneers.

                         DWARF
            Perhaps this is the call you've
            been waiting for all this time,
            sir...

DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...

                         DUKE
            Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...

DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A
MOVIE SPY.

                         DWARF
            That was headquarters.  They want
            me to go to Las Vegas at once and
            make contact with a Portuguese
            photographer named Lacerda.  He'll
            have the details.  All I have to do
            is check into my sound proof suite
            and he'll seek me out.

GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!

                         GONZO
            God hell!  I think I see the
            pattern!  This one sounds like real
            trouble!  You're going to need
            plenty of legal advice before this
            thing is over.  As your attorney I
            must advise you that you'll need a
            very fast car with no top and after
            that, the cocaine.  And then the
            tape recorder, for special music,
            and some Acapulco shirts...
                   (GONZO tucks his
                   khaki undershirt into
                   his white
                   bellbottoms -- he
                   means business!)
            This blows my weekend, because
            naturally I'll have to go with
            you -- and we'll have to arm
            ourselves.

                                                            9.


                         DUKE
            Why not?  If a thing's worth doing,
            it's worth doing right.

DUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them
with the (very large) check in his hand.

They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it
swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.

                         DUKE
            I tell you, my man.  This is the
            American Dream in action!  We'd be
            fools not to ride this strange
            torpedo all the way to the end.

                         GONZO
            Indeed.  We must do it.  What kind
            of story is this?

EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO emerge.

                         DUKE
            The Mint 400!  The richest off-road
            race for motorcycles and dune-
            buggies in the history of organized
            sport!
                   (handing parking
                   ticket to Valet)
            -- a fantastic spectacle in honor
            of some fatback grossero who owns
            the luxurious Mint Hotel in the
            heart of downtown Vegas... at least
            that's what the press release says.

Their car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They
jump in.

                         DUKE
            We're going to have to drum it up
            on our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.

And they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-
bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY

The PINTO races through shot.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Getting hold of the drugs and
            shirts had been no problem...

                                                           10.


EXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back
window full of Hawaiian shirts.

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            ... but the car and tape recorder
            were not easy things to round up at
            6:30 on a Friday afternoon in
            Hollywood.

INT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

TORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile
as GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four
Singapore Slings.

                         GONZO
            O.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.
            We'll be there in thirty minutes.
                   (to DUKE -- hand over
                   the PHONE)
            I finally located a car with
            adequate horsepower and the proper
            coloring.
                   (into PHONE)
            What?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has
            a major credit card!  Do you
            realize who the fuck you're talking
            to?

                         DUKE
            Don't take any guff from these
            swine.
                   (GONZO slams the
                   phone down)
            Now we need a sound store with the
            finest equipment.  Nothing dinky.
            One of those new Belgian Heliowatts
            with a voice-activated shotgun
            mike, for picking up conversations
            in oncoming cars.

                         GONZO
            We won't make the nut unless we
            have unlimited credit.

                         DUKE
            We will.  You Samoans are all the
            same.  You have no faith in the
            essential decency of the white
            man's culture.

                                                           11.


EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK

The PINTO races down street.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The store was closed, but the
            salesman said he would wait, if we
            hurried...

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK

They're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE
BANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            But we were delayed en route when a
            Stingray in front of us killed a
            pedestrain.

Directly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered
corpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.

EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

                         DUKE (V/O)
            We had trouble, again, at the car
            rental agency.

Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with
satisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out
a clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.

                         AGENT
            Say... uh... you fellas are going
            to be careful with this car, aren't
            you?

                         DUKE
            Of course.

DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the
gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.

                         AGENT
            Well, good god!  You just backed
            over that two foot concrete abutment
            and you didn't even slow down!
            Forty-five in reverse!  And you
            barely missed the pump!

                         DUKE
            No harm done.  I always test the
            transmission that way.  The rear
            end.  For stress factors.

                                                           12.


GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box
of rum and ice into the RED SHARK.

                         AGENT
            Say.  Are you fellows drinking?

                         DUKE
            Not me.  We're responsible people.

He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The
AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.

                         GONZO
            There's another worrier.  He's
            probably all cranked up on speed.

EXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

STRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted
figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            We spent the rest of that night
            rounding up materials and packing
            the car.  Then we ate some mescaline
            and went swimming.

The surf crashes in the distance...

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself
float up through the silvery bubbles...

DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING
MOONLIT SURF.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Our trip was different.  It was to
            be a classic affirmation of
            everything right and true in the
            national character; a gross,
            physical salute to the fantastic
            possibilities of life in this
            country.  But only for those with
            true grit...

EXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

DUKE's intense face.

                         DUKE
            ...and we're chock full of that!

                                                           13.


                         GONZO
            Damn right!

                         DUKE
            My attorney understands this
            concept, despite his racial handicap.
            But do you?!

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            He said he understood, but I could
            see in his eyes that he didn't.  He
            was lying to me.

                         GONZO
            My heart!

GONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and
screeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
            Where's the medicine?

                         DUKE
            The medicine?  Yes, it's right here.

DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.

                         DUKE
            Don't worry, this man has a bad
            heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we
            have a cure for it.

DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO
falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The
HITCHHIKER looks petrified.

                         GONZO
                   (suddenly flailing
                   his naked arms at the sky)
            Turn up the fucking music!  My
            heart feels like an alligator!
            Volume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must
            have bass!  What's wrong with us?
            Are you goddamn old ladies?

                         DUKE
                   (turns up music to
                   full volume)
            You scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch
            your language!  You're talking to a
            Doctor of Journalism!

                                                           14.


                         GONZO
                   (laughing uncontrollably)
            What the fuck are we doing out here?
            Somebody call the police!  We need
            help!

                         DUKE
                   (to HITCHHIKER)
            Pay no attention to this swine.  He
            can't handle the medicine.
                   (he begins laughing)


                         GONZO
                   (to the HITCHHIKER)
            The truth is we're going to Vegas
            to croak a scag baron named Savage
            Henry.  I've known him for years
            but he ripped us off -- and you
            know what that means, right?

GONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
            Savage Henry has cashed his check!
            We're going to rip his lungs out!

                         DUKE
            And eat them!  That bastard won't
            get away with this!  What's going
            on in this country when a scum
            sucker like that can get away with
            sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

GONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.

The HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,
AND FLEES.

                         HITCHHIKER
            Thanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.
            I like you guys.  Don't worry about
            me.

                         DUKE
                   (yells)
            Wait a minute!  Come back and have
            a beer!

The HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.

                                                           15.


                         GONZO
            Good riddance.  That boy made me
            nervous.  Did you see his eyes?
                   (laughing)
            Jesus, this is good medicine.

DUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.

                         DUKE
                   (suddenly clambering
                   into the front seat)
            Move over!!  We have to get out of
            California before that kid finds a
            cop!

DUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...

EXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead
driving.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It was absolutely imperative that
            we get to the Mint Hotel before the
            deadline for press registration.
            Otherwise, we might have to pay for
            our suite.

GONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off
and the powder swirls away on the wind.

                         GONZO
            Oh, Jesus!  Did you see what god
            just did to us?

                         DUKE
            God didn't do that!  You did it!
            You're a fucking narcotics agent,
            that was our cocaine, you pig!

                         GONZO
                   (waving his .357
                   Magnum at Duke)
            You better be careful.  Plenty of
            vultures out here.  They'll pick
            your bones clean before morning.

                         DUKE
            You whore!

GONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.

                                                           16.


                         GONZO
            Here -- chew this.  It's your half
            of the acid.

DUKE takes his half -- chews it.

                         DUKE
            How long do I have?

                         GONZO
            Maybe thirty more minutes.  As your
            attorney, I advise you to drive at
            top speed.  It'll be a goddamn
            miracle if we can get there before
            you turn into a wild animal.  Are
            you ready for that?  Checking into
            a Vegas hotel under a phony name
            with intent to commit capital fraud
            and a head full of acid.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Thirty minutes.  It was going to be
            very close.

The RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:
"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20
YEARS; SALE - LIFE!!"

EXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK

The RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner
spanning the street announces the MINT 400.

DUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a
buckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the
TICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.

                         DUKE
            I need this, right?

                         ATTENDANT
            I'll remember your face.

DUKE stares -- losing it...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There is no way of explaining the
            terror I felt.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP
ENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to
queue jump and failing.

                                                           17.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            I was pouring sweat.  My blood is
            too thick for Nevada.  I've never
            been able to properly explain
            myself in this climate.

A COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes
fixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            Be quiet, be calm... name, rank,
            and press affiliation, nothing
            else...

DUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the
tension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING
AROUND -- absolutely no success.

Something catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his
eyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET
WHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE
INEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            ...ignore this terrible drug,
            pretend it's not happening...

The LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE
comes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND
EXPLODES!

                         DUKE
            HI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL
            DUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S
            FOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL
            WISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT?
            I HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I
            REALIZE OF COURSE...

As DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH.
He tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.

                         DUKE
            ... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE
            LIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE.
            YES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND
            YOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S
            THE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?

DUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES.

                                                           18.


                         RESERVATIONS CLERK
                   (hands him an envelope)
            Your suite's not ready yet.  But
            there's somebody looking for you.

Her face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...

                         DUKE
                   (shouts)
            NO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
            YET!

The FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS.
DEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm
intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.

                         GONZO
            I can handle this.  This man has a
            bad heart, but I have plenty of
            medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.
            Prepare our suite at once.  We'll
            be in the bar.

GONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks
back -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green
jowls and fangs.

INT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY

The bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.
DUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the
wall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone...

                         GONZO
                   (to the bartender)
            Two Cuba Libres with beer and
            mescal on the side.
                   (opens the envelope)
            Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us
            in a room on the twelfth floor?

                         DUKE
            Lacerda?

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I couldn't remember.  The name rang
            a bell, but I couldn't concentrate.
            Terrible things were happening all
            around us...

DUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY
onto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.

                                                           19.


                         DUKE
            Order some golf shoes.  Otherwise,
            we'll never get out of this place
            alive.  It's impossible to walk in
            this muck -- no footing at all...

DUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.

DUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED
into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND
GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I was right in the middle of a
            fucking reptile zoo.  And somebody
            was giving booze to these goddamn
            things!  It won't be long before
            they tear us to shreds!

GONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.

                         GONZO
            If you think we're in trouble now
            wait until you see what's happening
            in the elevators.

GONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...
as he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to
keep him in his line of vision.

                         GONZO
            I just went upstairs to see this
            man Lacerda.  I told him I knew
            what he was up to...
                   (GONZO rallies --
                   turns fierce)
            He says he's a photographer!  But
            when I mentioned Savage Henry he
            freaked!  He knows we're onto him!

                         DUKE
            But what about our room?  And the
            golf shoes?

A GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at
them, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.

                         DUKE (CONT'D)
                   (grabbing GONZO
                   trying to hold him still)
            Holy shit!  Look at that bunch over
            there!  They've spotted us!

                                                           20.


Cut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing
next to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality.
GONZO is sitting in his original position.

                         GONZO
                   (downs his drink --
                   gets up)
            That's the press table.  Where you
            have to sign in for our credentials.
            Shit, let's get it over with.  You
            handle that, and I'll check on the
            room.

                         DUKE
            No, no.  Don't leave me!

Black screen.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK

A TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK,
protesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous
BELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on
the floor next to DUKE.

                         BELL BOY
            Four club sandwiches, four shrimp
            cocktails.

                         DUKE
            There's a big... machine in the
            sky... some kind of electric snake...

DUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon
sign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million
colored lights.

                         BELL BOY
            ... a quart of rum...

                         DUKE
            ... coming straight at us.

                         GONZO
            Shoot it.

                         DUKE
            Not yet.  I want to study its habits.

                         BELL BOY
            ... and nine fresh grapefruit.

                                                           21.


                         GONZO
            Vitamin C.  We'll need all we can
            get.

GONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into
DUKE.

                         GONZO
            Look, you've got to stop this talk
            about snakes and leeches and
            lizards and that stuff.  It's
            making me sick!

DUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS...

On TV: The LAOS INVASION -- A SERIES OF HORRIFYING
DISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE.

Newsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT
CALLEY court-martial.

                         DUKE
            What are you talking about?

                         GONZO
            You bastard!  They'll never let us
            back in that place.  I leave you
            alone for three minutes and you
            start waving that goddamn marlin
            spike around -- yelling about
            reptiles!  You scared the shit out
            of those people!  They were ready
            to call the cops.  Hell, the only
            reason they gave us press passes
            was to get you out of there...

A knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.

                         DUKE
            Oh my God!  Who's that?!

GONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to
LACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares
at a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep
suspicion.

                         LACERDA
            Duke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer.
            Got your press passes?  Good, good.
            Too bad you missed the bikes
            checking in.  My, what a sight!

DUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS.

                                                           22.


Looking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the
BOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers.

DUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised,
filthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him --
talking a foreign language.

                         LACERDA
            Husquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis.
            Maicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs.
            Couple of Triumphs, here and there
            a CZ.  All very fast.  What a race
            it's gonna be.

DUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK.  LACERDA is
now just a keen photographer.L

                         LACERDA
            Well, we start at dawn.  Get a good
            night's sleep.  I know I will.

And with a cheerful wave, he's gone.  DUKE is in shock.

                         DUKE
                   (weakly)
            That's good...

                         GONZO
            I think he's lying to us.  I could
            see it in his eyes.

                         DUKE
                   (even weaker)
            They'll probably have a big net for
            us when we show up.

DUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV...

                         GONZO
            Turn that shit off!

GONZO kills the TV.

Black screen.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Never lose sight of the primary
            responsibility.  Cover the story.
            But what was the story?  Nobody had
            bothered to say.

                                                           23.


EXT. DESERT - DAWN

Against A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE
SHOTGUNS into the dawn sky.  Clay pigeons shatter.  The Mint
Gun Club.

Next to them, MOTORCYCLES REV -- preparing for the MINT 400
RACE: A hundred BIKERS, MECHANICS and assorted MOTORSPORT
TYPES milling around in the pit area; taping headlights,
topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening.

DUKE wanders through.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The racers were ready at dawn.
            Very tense.  But the race didn't
            start until nine so we had three
            long hours to kill.

A sign by a long trestle table: "KOFFEE & DONUTS." DUKE
walks past -- ignoring the SMILING LADY behind the stall.

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            Those of us who had been up all
            night were in no mood for coffee
            and donuts.  We wanted strong drink.
            We were, after all, the Absolute
            Cream of the National Sporting
            Press and we were gathered here, in
            Las Vegas, for a very special
            assignment.  And when it comes to
            things like this you don't fool
            around.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

A real pit of iniquity.  Slot Machines.  Crap tables.  Smoke.
Drunken shouting.  The absolute cream of the NATIONAL
SPORTING PRESS.

DUKE is at the bar, engaged in drunken conversation with a
LIFE REPORTER...showing him his notebook.

                         DUKE
            See..."Kill the body and the head
            will die"... the Frazier/Ali fight...

                         MAGAZINE REPORTER
            A proper end to the 60's... Ali
            beaten by a human hamburger!

                         DUKE
            And both Kennedy's murdered by
            mutants.

                                                           24.


A SHOUT goes up from outside.  The sound of engines revving.

                         REPORTER
            That's it!  They're starting!

In a sudden rush the PRESS CROWD make for the door taking
DUKE with them.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV -- tension builds...

A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The MOTORCYCLES ROAR
AWAY.  A great cloud of dust goes up -- obscuring the RACERS
as they disappear into the desert...

A moment...

                         REPORTER
            Well, that's that.  They'll be back
            in an hour or so.  Let's go back to
            the bar.

The CROWD turns and streams back into the tent.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

DUKE heads for the bar along with the REST.  It's packed.
Drinks are ordered.

A shout from outside the tent goes up:

                         VOICE OFF
            Group 2!

The CROWD rushes for the door.  DUKE gets swept along.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV.  A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The
MOTORCYCLES ROAR AWAY.  Another great cloud of dust goes up...

The CROWD head back for the bar.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

The CROWD surge back to the bar.

                         VOICE OFF
            Group 3!

This time DUKE fights his way free of the CROWD.

                                                           25.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was something like 190 more
            bikes waiting to start.  They were
            due to go off 10 at a time every 2
            minutes.

DUKE hits the bar.

                         DUKE
            Beer!

A middle-aged HOODLUM in a T-shirt booms up to the bar.

                         HOODLUM
            God damn!  What day is this --
            Saturday?

                         DUKE
            More like Sunday.

                         HOODLUM
            Hah!  That's a bitch, ain't it?
            Last night I was home in Long Beach
            and somebody said they were runnin'
            the Mint 400 today, so I says to my
            old lady, "Man, I'm goin'." So she
            gives me a lot of crap about it, so
            I start slappin' her around, and
            the next thing you know two guys I
            never seen before are beating me
            stupid.

                         VOICE OFF
            Group 4!

Outside, another batch of motorcycles roar away -- kicking
up more clouds of dust.

                         HOODLUM
            Then they gave me ten bucks, put me
            on a bus, and when I woke up here I
            was in downtown Vegas, and for a
            minute all I could think was, "O
            Jesus, who's divorcing me this
            time?" But then I remembered, by
            God!  I was here for the Mint 400.
            And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful
            to be here.  Just wonderful to be
            here with you people.

A silence.  A MAGAZINE REPORTER lunges across the bar --
grabs the BARTENDER.

                                                           26.


                         MAGAZINE REPORTER
            Senzaman wassyneeds!

                         DUKE
                   (smacks the bar with
                   his palm)
            Hell yes!  Bring us ten!

                         VOICE OFF

            I'll back it!
                   (slides off his stool
                   to the floor)


Outside, motorcycles roar away.  The dust cloud billows into
the tent -- getting denser.

                         MAGAZINE REPORTER (CONT'D)
                   (on the floor)
            This is a magic moment in sport!
            It may never come again!  I once
            did the Triple Crown, but it was
            nothing like this.

A FROG-EYED WOMAN claws at the MAGAZINE REPORTER, tries to
haul him up.

                         FROG-EYED WOMAN
            Please stand up!  You're a
            correspondent for a major national
            magazine who's name we can't get
            clearance for!  Please!  You'd be a
            very handsome man if you'd just
            stand up!

                         MAGAZINE REPORTER
            Listen, madam.  I'm damn near
            intolerably handsome down here
            where I am.  You'd go crazy if I
            stood up!

A feverishly eager LACERDA appears out of the dust cloud, 3
cameras slung round his neck.

                         LACERDA
            Club soda, please.

                         FROG-EYED WOMAN
                   (to MAGAZINE REPORTER)
            Please!  I love Life!

                                                           27.


                         LACERDA
                   (to DUKE)
            Man, it's great out there!

                         DUKE
            Lunatics.

LACERDA grins.

                         VOICE OFF
            Group 6!

                         LACERDA
            Meet you outside!

LACERDA downs his drink -- hurries out through the crowd and
out into the cloud of dust.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Nothing.  Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST.

Barely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits.
The RIDER staggers off his bike.  The PIT CREW gas it up and
sends it back with a FRESH RIDER.

DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            By 10 they were spread out all over
            the course.  It was no longer a
            race, now it was an Endurance
            Contest.  The idea of trying to
            "cover this race" in any
            conventional press sense was absurd.

A HORN HONKS.  A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER.  LACERDA
hangs out of the window.

                         LACERDA
            It's great, isn't it?!  Jump in!

DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

IN THE BRONCO.

DUKE hangs on with his beer.  Nothing all around but the
HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.  LACERDA snaps madly away
at nothing at all!

                                                           28.


                         LACERDA
            I'll just keep trying different
            combos of film and lenses till I
            find one that works in this dust!

The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING...

We hear music and voices singing:

                         BATTLE HYMN
            "...As we go marching on
            When I reach my final campground,
            in
            that land beyond the sun,
            And the Great Commander asks me..."
            [What did he ask you, Rusty?]
            "Did you fight or did you run?"

A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust.  DUKE
coughs, chokes, drinks beer.

                         BATTLE HYMN
                   (continuing)
            [And what did you tell them,
            Rusty?]
            "We responded to their rifle fire
            with everything we had..."

The sound of gun shots...

A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE
RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL.  The radio blares:
"THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."

The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING
EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS.  A slant-eyed
Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and
stripes.  A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side.  They
yell over the roaring engines.

                         DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
            Where's the damn race?

                         DUKE
            Beats me.  We're just good patriotic
            Americans like yourself.

DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN.  In
response, the PASSENGER #2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his
grip on an automatic weapon.

                         DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
                   (suspiciously)
            What outfit you fellas with?

                                                           29.


                         DUKE
            The sporting press.  We're
            friendlies.  Hired geeks.

The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks.

                         DUKE
            If you want a good chase, you
            should get after that skunk from
            CBS News up ahead in the black jeep.
            He's the man responsible for that
            book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.

                         DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1
            HOT DAMN!

                         DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2
            A black jeep, you say?

And they ROAR away.

                         DUKE
            Take me back to the pits.

                         LACERDA
            No, no -- we have to go on.  We
            need total coverage.

DUKE gets out of the Bronco.

                         DUKE
            You're fired.

After a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver
roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It was time.  I felt, for an
            Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole
            scene.  The race was definitely
            under way.  I had witnessed the
            start; I was sure of that much.
            But what now?

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

MUSIC PUMPS OUT.  CRUISING IN THE RED SHARK IN VEGAS.  THE
SKY SWIRLS WITH MILLIONS OF NEON LIGHTS CHASING EACH OTHER
IN BAROQUE PATTERNS ACROSS GIGANTIC HOTEL SIGNS.  PSYCHEDELIC
LIGHT SHOWS TO LURE AND DERANGE THE INNOCENT.  CITY OF LOST
SOULS.

                                                           30.


                         DUKE
            Turn up the radio!  Turn up the
            tape machine!  Roll the windows
            down.  Let's taste this cool desert
            wind!  Aaah, yes!  This is what
            it's all about!

DUKE, beer in hand, drives -- a big smile for the world.
GONZO scans The Vegas Visitor.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Total control now.  Tooling along
            the main drag on a Saturday night
            in Vegas, two good old boys in a
            fire apple red convertible...
            stoned, ripped, twisted... Good
            people!

                         GONZO
            How about "Nickel Nick's Slot
            Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds
            heavy.  Twenty-nine cent hotdogs...

                         DUKE
            Look, what are we doing here?  Are
            we here to entertain ourselves, or
            to do the job?

                         GONZO
            To do the job, of course.  Here we
            go... a Crab Louie and quart of
            muscatel for twenty dollars!

The Shark hits a bump.

                         GONZO
            As your attorney I advise you to
            drive over to the Tropicana and
            pick up on Guy Lombardo.  He's in
            the Blue Room with his Royal
            Canadians.

They hit another bump.

                         DUKE
            Why?

                         GONZO
            Why what?

CUT to wide shot.  They are DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES in a
large casino parking lot, bumping over the dividers.

                                                           31.


                         DUKE
            Why should I pay out my hard-earned
            dollars to watch a fucking corpse.
            I don't know about you, but in my
            line of business it's important to
            be Hep.

EXT. DESERT ROOM HOTEL - NIGHT

TWO BIG SCREAMING FACES.

                         DOORMAN #1
            What the hell are you doing?!

                         DOORMAN #2
            You can't park here!

                         DUKE
            Why not?  Is this not a reasonable
            place to park?

Reveal the RED SHARK parked on the sidewalk in front of the
Desert Inn.  TWO DOORMEN loom over the car hood.  The
MARQUEE says: TONIGHT.  DEBBIE REYNOLDS.

GONZO leaps from the car, waving a five-dollar bill at the
DOORMAN.

                         GONZO
            We want this car parked!  We drove
            all the way from L.A. for this show.
            We're friends of Debbie's.

A pause, then... the DOORMAN pockets the bill, hands them a
parking stub.  DUKE and GONZO hurry into the hotel.

INT. DESERT FROM HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO walk through the lobby.  Black, mirrored,
sleek, classy.

                         DUKE
            Holy shit!  They almost had us
            there!  That was quick thinking.

                         GONZO
            What do you expect?  I'm your
            attorney.  You owe me five bucks.
            I want it now.

DUKE shrugs and hands over the $5.

                                                           32.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            This was Bob Hope's turf.  Frank
            Sinatra's.  Spiro Agnew's.  It
            seemed inappropriate to be haggling
            about nickel/dime bribes for the
            parking lot attendant.

A WINE-COLORED TUXEDO stops them at the entrance to the
ballroom.

                         WINE-COLORED TUXEDO
            Sorry, full house.

                         GONZO
            Goddamnit, we drove all the way
            from L.A.

                         WINE-COLORED TUXEDO
            I said there are no seats left...
            at any price.

                         GONZO
            Fuck seats!  We're old friends of
            Debbie's.  I used to romp with her.

GONZO and the WINE-COLORED TUXEDO get into an ugly arm-
waving negotiation.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            After a lot of bad noise, he let us
            in for nothing provided we would
            stand quietly at the back and not
            smoke.

As DUKE and GONZO disappear through the door we can hear the
orchestra blasting out a HIGHLY BLANDIZED "SGT. PEPPER'S
LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND."

A beat.

The door flies open and BOUNCERS manhandle DUKE and GONZO
out.  Despite the rough treatment they're both SCREECHING
WITH LAUGHTER.

                         GONZO
            Jesus creeping shit!

                         DUKE
                   (tears streaming)
            Did the mescaline just kick in?  Or
            was that Debbie Reynolds in a
            silver Afro wig?!

                                                           33.


                         GONZO
                   (in hysteria)
            We wandered into a fucking time
            capsule!

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

DUKE DRIVES FAST into the night.  They're both LAUGHING
HYSTERICALLY.

                         DUKE
                   (in hysteria)
            We wandered into a fucking time
            capsule!

THEN... GONZO finds a TINY TEAR IN HIS JACKET...

                         GONZO
            What's this?...

GONZO is instantly MOROSE.

                         GONZO
            That scum...

GONZO twists round in the car -- SCREAMS back into the night.

                         GONZO
            SCUM!  I know where you live!  I'll
            find you and burn down your fucking
            house!

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS - NIGHT

A hundred foot high neon clown: BAZOOKO CIRCUS.

The RED SHARK pulls up beneath the sign.

                         DUKE
            This is the place.  They'll never
            fuck with us here.

                         GONZO
            Where's the ether?  This mescaline
            isn't working.

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

Into the GLARING, CHASING LIGHTS of the entrance canopy
steps DUKE in EC/U holding a KLEENEX SOAKED IN ETHER TO HIS
NOSE.

                                                           34.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Ah, devil ether.  It makes you
            behave like the village drunkard in
            some early Irish novel... total
            loss of all basic motor skills;
            blurred vision, no balance, numb
            tongue --
                   (throws away kleenex)
            The mind recoils in horror, unable
            to communicate with the spinal
            column.  Which is interesting,
            because you can actually watch
            yourself behaving in this terrible
            way, but you can't control it.

DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care-
taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            You approach the turnstiles and
            know that when you get there, you
            have to give the man two dollars or
            he won't let you inside... but when
            you get there, everything goes wrong.

THE ETHER KICKS IN:

DUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES,
GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING
CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Some angry Rotarian shoves you and
            you think: What's happening here?
            What's going on?  Then you hear
            yourself mumbling.

                         DUKE
                   (mumbling)
            Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of
            mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My
            name is Brinks; I was born... Born?

                         GONZO
            Get sheep over side... women and
            children to armored car... orders
            from Captain Zeep.

The ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES.

                                                           35.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Ether is the perfect drug for Las
            Vegas.  In this town they love a
            drunk.  Fresh meat.  So they put us
            through the turnstiles and turned
            us loose inside.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

Flames shoot up from below the casino.  Above, a HIGH WIRE
ACT with FOUR MUZZLED WOLVERINES, SIX NYMPHET SISTERS FROM
SAN DIEGO, TWO SILVER PAINTED POLACK BROTHERS, and THREE
KOREAN KITTENS.

The WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air.  TWO POLACKS
swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly
locked in a death battle.

All plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES
and SLOT MACHINES.  No one looks up.  The GAMBLERS REMAIN
INTENT ON THE SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL, THE TURN OF THE CARD,
THE ROLL OF A DICE.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Bazooko Circus is what the whole
            hep world would be doing Saturday
            night if the Nazis had won the war.
            This was the Sixth Reich.

Something causes DUKE to look down.  A dwarf carrying drinks
on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to
move out of the way.

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            A drug person can learn to cope
            with things like seeing their dead
            grandmother crawling up their leg
            with a knife in her teeth but,
            nobody should be asked to handle
            this trip.

GONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths.
One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume.  A
FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE.

                         FAIRGROUND BARKER
            Stand in front of this fantastic
            machine, my friend.  For just 99
            cents your likeness will appear 200
            hundred feet tall on a screen above
            downtown Las Vegas.

On a TV monitor a 200 FOOT HIGH DRUNKARD looms over the Las
Vegas skyline screaming OBSCENITIES.

                                                           36.


                         FAIRGROUND BARKER
            99 cents more for a voice message.
            Say whatever you want, fella.
            They'll hear you, don't worry about
            that.  Remember, you'll be 200 feet
            tall!

                         ANOTHER BARKER
            Step right up!  Shoot the pasties
            off the nipples of this ten-foot
            bull-dyke and win a cotton candy
            goat!

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO sit on the revolving platform.  GONZO
stares -- glassy eyed -- coming apart.

                         GONZO
            I hate to say this, but this place
            is getting to me.  I think I'm
            getting The Fear.

                         DUKE
            Nonsense.  We came here to find the
            American Dream, and now we're right
            in the vortex you want to quit.
            You must realize that we've found
            the Main Nerve.

                         GONZO
            That's what gives me The Fear.

                         DUKE
            Look over there.  Two women fucking
            a Polar Bear.

                         GONZO
            Please, don't tell me those things...
            Not now.
                   (signals the waitress
                   for two Wild Turkeys)
            This is my last drink.  How much
            money can you lend me?

                         DUKE
            Not much.  Why?

                         GONZO
            I have to go.

                         DUKE
            GO?

                                                           37.


                         GONZO
            Yes.  Leave the country.  Tonight.

                         DUKE
            Calm down.  You'll be straight in a
            few hours.

                         GONZO
            No.  This is serious.  One more
            hour in this town and I'll kill
            somebody!

                         DUKE
            OK.  I'll lend you some money.
            Let's go outside and see how much
            we have left.

                         GONZO
            Can we make it?

                         DUKE
            That depends on how many people we
            fuck with between here and the door.

                         GONZO
            I want to leave fast.

                         DUKE
            OK.  Lets pay this bill and get up
            very slowly.  It's going to be a
            long walk.
                   (signals waitress who
                   comes over)


                         GONZO
                   (suddenly to waitress)
            Do they pay you to screw that bear?

                         WAITRESS
            What?

                         DUKE
            He's just kidding.
                   (to GONZO)
            Come on, Doc -- lets go downstairs
            and gamble.

GONZO trembles with fear -- walks to the edge of the
turntable.

                         GONZO
            When does this thing stop?

                                                           38.


                         DUKE
            It won't stop.  It's not ever going
            to stop.

DUKE carefully steps off the turntable.

GONZO, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and
confusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away.

                         DUKE
            Don't move you'll come around.

DUKE reaches out to grab GONZO, who jumps back -- keeps
going around.

The BARTENDER narrows his eyes at them.

DUKE steps onto the merry-go-round -- hurries round the
bar -- approaching GONZO from the blind side and shoves
GONZO from behind.  GONZO goes down with a hellish scream.
DUKE approaches him with his hands in the air.  Smiling.

                         DUKE
            You fell.  Let's go.

GONZO refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched,
looking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps?

                         DUKE (CONT'D)
            OK.  You stay here and go to jail.
            I'm leaving.

DUKE walks fast towards the stairs.  GONZO catches up with
him.

                         GONZO
            Did you see that?  Some sonofabitch
            kicked me in the back.

                         DUKE
            Probably the bartender.  He wanted
            to stomp you for what you said to
            the waitress.

                         GONZO
            Good God!  Let's get out of here!
            Where's the elevator?

                         DUKE
                   (turning him in the
                   opposite direction)
            Don't go near that elevator.
            That's just what they want us to
            do... trap us in a steel box and
            take us down to the basement.

                                                           39.


EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO stumble out of the entrance.

                         DUKE
            Don't run.  They'd like any excuse
            to shoot us.

                         GONZO
                   (in an extended fall)
            You drive!  I think there's
            something wrong with me.

INT. MINT HOTEL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THEIR SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE AND GONZO RUN MADLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR... DUKE TAKING
CARE NOT TO STEP ON THE PATTERNED PART OF THE CARPET.

GONZO STRUGGLES with the key in the lock.

                         GONZO
            Those bastards have changed the
            lock on us.  They probably searched
            the room.  Jesus, we're finished!

The door SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN.  DUKE AND GONZO fall inside.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

                         GONZO
            Bolt everything!  Use all chains!

DUKE locks the door.  The suite is crowded with ROOM SERVICE
GOODIES.  DUKE turns to see GONZO staring at two hotel room
keys.  EVERYTHING STOPS.

                         GONZO
            Where did this one come from?

DUKE snatches a key.

                         DUKE
            That's Lacerda's room.

GONZO smiles a slow smile...

                         GONZO
            Yeah... I thought we might need it...

                         DUKE
            What for?

GONZO snatches the key back.

                                                           40.


                         GONZO
            Let's go up there and blast him out
            of bed with the fire hose.

                         DUKE
            No, we should leave the poor
            bastard alone.  I get the feeling
            that he's avoiding us for some
            reason.

                         GONZO
            Don't kid yourself.  That Portuguese
            son of a bitch is dangerous.  He's
            watching us like a hawk.

                         DUKE
            He told me he was turning in early...

GONZO utters an anguished cry -- slaps the wall with both
hands.

                         GONZO
            That dirty bastard!  I knew it!
            He's got hold of my woman!

                         DUKE
                   (laughing)
            That little blonde groupie with the
            film crew?  You think he sodomized
            her?

                         GONZO
            That's right, laugh about it!  You
            goddamn honkies are all the same!

GONZO SLASHES A GRAPEFRUIT with a HUGE RAZOR SHARP HUNTING
KNIFE.  DUKE blanches.

                         DUKE
            Where'd you get that knife?

GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- MANIACAL.

                         GONZO
            Room service sent it up.  I wanted
            something to cut the limes.

GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS!

                         DUKE
            What limes?

GONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS!

                                                           41.


                         GONZO
            They didn't have any.  They don't
            grow in the desert.

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!

                         GONZO
            That dirty toad bastard!  I knew I
            should have taken him out when I
            had the chance.  Now he has her.

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO SLASHES INSANELY!

DUKE watches -- straight-faced.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I remember the girl.  We'd had a
            problem with her in the elevator a
            few hours earlier: my attention had
            made a fool of himself.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

An elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF
LACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW.

DUKE and GONZO stagger in.

LACERDA drops his smile.  He's standing beside the BLONDE TV
REPORTER.  A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her.

                         BLONDE TV REPORTER
                   (to Gonzo)
            You must be a rider.  What class
            are you in?

                         GONZO
            Class?  What the fuck do you mean?

                         BLONDE TV REPORTER
            What do you ride?  We're filming
            the race for a TV series -- maybe
            we can use you.

                         GONZO
            Use me?

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Mother of God, I thought.  Here it
            comes.

GONZO is TREMBLING BADLY.  There's a moment of uncomfortable
silence.

                                                           42.


                         GONZO
                   (suddenly shouting)
            I ride the BIG ONES!  The really
            BIG fuckers!

GONZO shows his teeth to LACERDA.  DUKE laughs trying to
defuse the scene.

                         DUKE
            The Vincent Black Shadow.  We're
            with the Factory Team.

                         TV CAMERAMAN
            Bullshit.

GONZO stills -- becomes dangerous -- zeros in on the TV
CAMERAMAN -- groin to groin...

                         GONZO
            Wait a minute, pardon me lady, but
            I think there's some kind of
            ignorant chicken-sucker in this car
            who needs his face cut open.  You
            cheap honky faggots!  Which one of
            you wants to get cut?!

DEAD SILENCE.

Ding!  The elevator door opens, but nobody moves.  The door
closes.

Next floor.  Ding!  The door opens again.  A middle-aged
couple start to get in.  Change their minds.  The door closes.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

DUKE and GONZO run down the corridor.  GONZO LAUGHS WILDLY.

                         GONZO
            Spooked!  They were spooked!  Like
            rats in a death cage!

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO CRASH into their hotel suite -- BOLT THE DOOR.
GONZO stops laughing.

                         GONZO
            Goddamn.  It's serious now.  That
            girl understood.  She fell in love
            with me.

END FLASHBACK.

                                                           43.


INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO with the BIG HUNTING KNIFE --
sliced grapefruit segments everywhere.

                         GONZO
            Let's go up there and castrate that
            fucker!

GONZO pauses -- A MAD THOUGHT -- turns to DUKE.

                         GONZO
                   (squinting suspiciously)
            Have you made a deal with him?  Did
            you put him on to her?

                         DUKE
                   (backing slowly
                   towards the door)
            Look you better put that blade away
            and get your head straight.  I have
            to put the car in the lot.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            One of the things you learn, after
            years of dealing with drug people,
            is that you can turn your back on a
            person, but never turn your back on
            a drug.  Especially when it's
            waving a razor-sharp hunting knife
            in your eyes.

INT. CASINO/LOBBY MINT HOTEL

The MAGAZINE REPORTER is on the telephone.

                         MAGAZINE REPORTER
            Las Vegas at dawn.  The racers are
            still asleep, the dust is still on
            the desert, fifty thousand dollars
            in prize money, slumbers darkly in
            the office safe at Del Webb's
            fabulous Mint Hotel...

DUKE walks past the REPORTER -- into THE CASINO, THE SAD,
MEAGRE CROWDS AROUND THE CRAP TABLES.  No joy.  DUKE watches.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Who are these people?  These faces!
            Where do they come from?  They look
            like caricatures of used car
            dealers from Dallas.

                                                           44.


                         DUKE (V/O; CONT'D)
            And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell
            of a lot of them at four-thirty on
            a Monday morning.  Still humping
            the American dream, that vision of
            the big winner somehow emerging
            from the last minute predawn chaos
            of a stale Vegas casino.

DUKE stops at the Money Wheel, puts down a two dollar bill
on a number, the wheel turns, he loses.

                         DUKE
            You bastards!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            No.  Calm down.  Learn to ENJOY
            losing.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE walks back into the room.  We hear the LOUD STRAINS OF
THREE DOG NIGHT'S "JOY TO THE WORLD."

He walks to the bathroom and opens the door.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.
Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A
large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The
shower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER
PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over
the sink.

DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED
UP WHITE BLOTTER.

                         DUKE
            You ate ALL THIS ACID?

No answer.

                         DUKE
                   (turning down the volume)
            You evil son of a bitch.  You
            better hope there's some Thorazine
            in that bag, because if there's
            not, you're in bad trouble.

                         GONZO
            Music!  Turn it up.  Put that tape
            on.

                                                           45.


                         DUKE
            What tape?

                         GONZO
            Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit."
            I want a rising sound.

                         DUKE
            You're doomed.  I'm leaving here in
            two hours and then they're going to
            come up here and beat the mortal
            shit out of you with big saps.
            Right there in that tub.

                         GONZO
            I dig my own graves.  Green water
            and the White Rabbit.  Put it on.

                         DUKE
            OK.  But do me one last favor, will
            you.  Can you give me two hours?
            That's all I ask -- just two hours
            to sleep before tomorrow.  I
            suspect it's going to be a very
            difficult day.

He switches on the tape. "WHITE RABBIT" begins to build.

                         GONZO
                   (coolly)
            Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll
            give you all the time you need, at
            my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but
            you'll be wanting a cushion, so,
            why don't you just lay one of those
            $100 bills down there beside the
            radio, and fuck off?

                         DUKE
            How about a check?

                         GONZO
            Whatever's right.

DUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and
leaves, closing the door behind him.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted.
Suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.

                         GONZO (V/O)
            Help!  You bastard!  I need help!

                                                           46.


DUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.

                         DUKE
            Shit, he's killing himself!

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

DUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio
with the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its
mounts.

                         GONZO
                   (snarling)
            I want that fucking radio!

DUKE GRABS THE RADIO.

                         DUKE
            Don't touch it!  Get back in that
            tub!

                         GONZO
            Back the tape up.  I need it again!
            Let it roll!  Just as high as the
            fucker can go!  And when it comes
            to that fantastic note where the
            rabbit bites its own head off, I
            want you to THROW THAT FUCKING
            RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!

DUKE stares down at GONZO.

                         DUKE
            Not me.  It would blast you through
            the wall -- stone dead in ten
            seconds and they'd make me explain
            it!

                         GONZO
            BULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.

HIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.

                         DUKE
            Jesus.

                         GONZO
            Do it!  I want to get HIGHER!

DUKE considers this.  He's had enough.

                                                           47.


                         DUKE
            Okay.  You're right.  This is
            probably the only solution.
                   (holds the PLUGGED IN
                   TAPE/RADIO over the tub)
            Let me make sure I have it all
            lined up.  You want me to throw
            this thing into the tub when "WHITE
            RABBIT" peaks.  Is that it?

GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.

                         GONZO
            Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think
            I was going to have to go out and
            get one of the goddamn maids to do
            it.

                         DUKE
            Are you ready?

He switches "WHITE RABBIT" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS
AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.

Meanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a
good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when "WHITE
RABBIT" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.

GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A
TIDAL WAVE.

DUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF
THE BATHROOM.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE slumps onto the sofa.

SILENCE.

GONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE
WAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at
DUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.

                         DUKE
            MACE!  YOU WANT THIS?

GONZO stops -- hisses.

                         GONZO
            You bastard!  You'd do that,
            wouldn't you?

                                                           48.


                         DUKE
                   (laughs)
            Why worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing
            in the world like a Mace high.
            Forty-five minutes on your knees
            with the dry heaves...

                         GONZO
            You cheap honky sonofabitch...

                         DUKE
            Why not?  Hell, just a minute ago,
            you were asking me to kill you!
            And now you want to kill me!  What
            I should do, goddamnit, is call the
            police!

                         GONZO
            The cops?

                         DUKE
            There's no choice.  I wouldn't dare
            go to sleep with you wandering
            around with a head full of acid and
            wanting to slice me up with that
            goddamn knife!

                         GONZO
                   (mumbles)
            Who said anything about slicing you
            up?  I just wanted to carve a
            little Z on your forehead.  Nothing
            serious.

GONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.

                         DUKE
                   (menaces him with the MACE)
            Get back in that tub.  Eat some
            reds and try to calm down.  Smoke
            some grass, shoot some smack --
            shit, do whatever you have to do,
            but let me get some rest.

GONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.

                         GONZO
            Hell, yes.  You really need some
            sleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.
            What a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't
            let me keep you up.

                                                           49.


GONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair
up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next
to the clock.

DUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He
collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom.
            Just another ugly refugee from the
            Love Generation.

The WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his
face.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL
BEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            My attorney had never been able to
            accept the notion -- often espoused
            by former drug abusers -- that you
            can get a lot higher without drugs
            than with them.  And neither have
            I, for that matter.

The pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL
LIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the
foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior
of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.

INT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT

A slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the
action is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I recall one night in the Matrix.
            There I was -- a victim of the Drug
            Explosion.  A natural street freak,
            just eating whatever came by.

A ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The
sound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.

                         ROAD-PERSON
            Anybody want some L...S...D...?  I
            got all the makin's right here.
            All I need is a place to cook.

The camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.

INT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Still in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a
HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.

                                                           50.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            I decided to eat only half at first.
            Good thinking.  But I spilled the
            rest on the sleeve of my red
            Pendleton shirt.

DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the
door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in
slow-motion.

                         MUSICIAN
            What's the trouble?

                         DUKE
                   (also in slow-motion)
            Well, all this white stuff on my
            sleeve is LSD.

The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A
long pause.

Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-
cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.
We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the
men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...
sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The
STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            With a bit of luck his life was
            ruined -- forever thinking that
            just behind some narrow door in all
            his favorite bars, men in red
            Pendleton shirts are getting
            incredible kicks from things he'll
            never know.

INT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT

The STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking
lost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a
TV white noise snowstorm.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE sits staring at the TV.

                                                           51.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Strange memories on this nervous
            night in Las Vegas.
                   (he gets up, pours
                   himself a drink)
            Has it been five years?  Six?  It
            seems like a lifetime -- the kind
            of peak that never comes again.
            San Francisco in the middle sixties
            was a very special time and place
            to be a part of.  But no
            explanation, no mix of words or
            music or memories can touch that
            sense of knowing that you were
            there and alive in that corner of
            time and the world.  Whatever it
            meant.

DUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.

EXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE

We are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,
            AT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE
            SPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A
            FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT
            WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,
            THAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I
            THINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE
            OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE
            FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY
            MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T
            NEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY
            prevail.  We had all the momentum;
            we were riding the crest of a high
            and beautiful wave...

DUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            So now, less than five years later,
            you can go up on a steep hill in
            Las Vegas and look west, and with
            the right kind of eyes you can
            almost see the high water mark --
            that place where the wave finally
            broke and rolled back.

                                                           52.


The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.
Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi
shouting "WOODSTOCK ÜBER ALLES!"

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN

A harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking
like shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The decision to flee came suddenly.
            Or maybe not.

DUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of
fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.

                         BELL BOY
            Room service!

The BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already
stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Maybe I'd planned it all along --
            subconsciously waiting for the
            right moment.  The bill was a
            factor, I think.  Because I had no
            money to pay for it.

DUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Our room service tabs had been
            running somewhere between $29 and
            $36 per hour, for forty-eight
            consecutive hours.  Incredible.
            How could it happen?

DUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED
LUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --
empty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            But by the time I asked this
            question, there was no one around
            to answer.

DUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.

                                                           53.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            My attorney was gone.  He must have
            sensed trouble.

                                            QUICK CUT TO:

EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY

GONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of
brand-new fine cowhide luggage.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Panic.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --
leaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both
ways, then hurries away down the corridor.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It crept up my spine like first
            rising vibes of an acid frenzy.
            All these horrible realities began
            to dawn on me.

INT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY

An anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the
elevator descends.  He searches his pockets...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Here I was, alone in Las Vegas,
            with this goddamned incredibly
            expensive car, completely twisted
            on drugs, no cash, no story for the
            magazine.  And on top of everything
            else I had a gigantic goddamn hotel
            bill to deal with.

DUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.

The door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN
HANDCUFFS.

DUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors
close.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I didn't even know who had won the
            race.  Maybe nobody.

                                                           54.


INT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering
MANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.

                         DUKE
                   (muttering to himself)
            How would Horatio Alger have
            handled this situation?

EXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY

Motoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN
with a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves
at the CAR BOY.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Stay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a
            relatively respectable citizen -- a
            multiple felon, perhaps, but
            certainly not dangerous.

The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The
back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint
400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            Luckily, I had taken the soap and
            grapefruit and other luggage out to
            the car a few hours earlier.  Now
            it was only a matter of slipping
            the noose...

DUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!

                         CLERK'S VOICE
            MR. DUKE!

DUKE freezes.

                         CLERK'S VOICE
            Mr. Duke!  We've been looking for
            you!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The game was up!  They had me.

                         DUKE
                   (to himself)
            Well, why not?  Many fine books
            have been written in prison.

                                                           55.


Resigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK
arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS
HAND.

                         CLERK
            Sir?
                   (thrusts out a TELEGRAM)
            This telegram came for you.
            Actually, it isn't for you.  It's
            for somebody named Thompson, but it
            says 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does
            that make sense?

                         DUKE
                   (barely able to speak)
            Yes... It makes sense.

DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.

The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous
stash inside.

                         CLERK
            I checked the register for this man
            Thompson.  We don't show him but I
            figured he might be part of your
            team.

                         DUKE
            He is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to
            him.

He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.

SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word
or two.

                         CLERK
            What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's
            signature on the telegram from Los
            Angeles.  When we knew he was right
            here in the hotel.

                         DUKE
            You did the right thing.  Never try
            to understand a press message.
            About half the time we use codes --
            especially with Dr. Gonzo.

                         CLERK
            Tell me.  When will the doctor be
            awake?

                                                           56.


                         DUKE
                   (tenses)
            Awake?  What do you mean?

DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.

                         CLERK
                   (uncomfortably)
            Well... the manager, Mr. Heem,
            would like to meet him.  Nothing
            unusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet
            all our large accounts... put them
            on a personal basis... just a chat
            and a handshake, you understand.

                         DUKE
            Of course.  But if I were you, I'd
            leave the Doctor alone until after
            he's eaten breakfast.  He's a very
            crude man.

DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.

                         CLERK
            But he will be available?  Perhaps
            later this morning?

                         DUKE
            Look.  That telegram was all
            scrambled.  It was actually from
            Thompson, not to him.  Western
            Union must have gotten the names
            reversed.  I have to get going.  I
            have to get out to the track.

                         CLERK
            There's no hurry!  The race is over!

                         DUKE
                   (taking off)
            Not for me.

He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.

                         CLERK
            Let's have lunch!

                         DUKE
            Righto!

EXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY

DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.

                                                           57.


A "YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS" sign flashes past.

Bob Dylan plays: "Memphis Blues Again -- "Aaww, Mama, can
this really by the end...?"

A sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Jesus, bad waves of paranoia,
            madness, fear and loathing --
            intolerable vibrations in this
            place.  Get out!  The weasels were
            closing in.  I could smell the ugly
            brutes.  Flee!

DUKE drives fast.

                         DUKE
            Do me one last favor Lord: just
            give me five more high-speed hours
            before you bring the hammer down;
            just let me get rid of this goddamn
            car and off of this horrible desert.

A sign flashes "YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE."

A patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.

                         DUKE (CONT'D)
            You evil bastard!  This is your
            work!  You'd better take care of
            me, Lord... because if you don't
            you're going to have me on your
            hands.

The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Few people understand the psychology
            of dealing with a Highway Traffic
            Cop.  Your normal speeder will
            panic and immediately pull over to
            the side.  This is wrong.

DUKE floors the gas pedal.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

THE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.

                                                           58.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Make the bastard chase you.  He
            will follow.  But he won't know
            what to make of your blinker signal
            that says you're about to turn right.

DUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            This is to let him know you're
            looking for a proper place to pull
            off and talk.

AN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.

DUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It will take him a moment to
            realize that he is about to make
            180 degree turn at speed... but you
            will be ready for it, braced for
            the G's and the fast heel toe work.

The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.

EXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY

The patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE
stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Just what the FUCK did you think
            you were doing?!

DUKE smiles.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            May I see your license.

                         DUKE
            Of course, officer.

DUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer
can -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I knew I was fucked.

The COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for
DUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.

                                                           59.


                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Could I have that, please?

                         DUKE
            Why not?  It was getting warm anyway.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --
glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars
of soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            You realize...

                         DUKE
            Yeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I
            understand that.  I knew it was a
            crime but I did it anyway.  Shit,
            why argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            That's a strange attitude.

He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            You know -- I get the feeling you
            could use a nap.  There's a rest
            area up ahead.  Why don't you pull
            over and sleep a few hours?

                         DUKE
            A nap won't help.  I've been awake
            for too long -- three or four
            nights.  I can't even remember.  If
            I go to sleep now, I'm dead for
            twenty hours.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes
            into my book, as of noon, is that I
            apprehended you... for driving too
            fast, and advised you to proceed no
            further than the next rest area...
            your stated destination, right?
            Where you plan to take a long nap.
            Do I make myself clear?

                         DUKE
            How far is Baker?  I was hoping to
            stop there for lunch.

                                                           60.


                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Not my jurisdiction.  The city
            limits are two point two miles
            beyond the rest area.  Can you make
            it that far?

                         DUKE
            I'll try.  I've been wanting to go
            to Baker for a long time.  I've
            heard a lot about it.

The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Excellent seafood.  With a mind
            like yours, you'll probably want to
            try the land-crab.  Try the Majestic
            Diner.

The PATROLMAN slams the door shut.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

DUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I felt raped.  The Pig had done me
            on all fronts, and now he was going
            off to chuckle about it -- on the
            west side of town, waiting for me
            to make a run for L.A.

DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he
signals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn
he sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn
their eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER
drops his thumb.

                         DUKE
            Great Jesus, it's him.

DUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE
WAY HE CAME.

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.

                         DUKE
            They've nailed me!  I'm trapped in
            some stinking desert crossroads
            called Baker.  I don't have much
            time.  The fuckers are closing in.
            They'll hunt me down like a beast!

                                                           61.


INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

GONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican
Day of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons.

                         GONZO
            Who?  You sound a little paranoid.

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE screams -- sweat pouring.

                         DUKE
            You bastard!  I need a lawyer
            immediately!

INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

                         GONZO
            What are you doing in Baker?
            Didn't you get my telegram?

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

                         DUKE
            What?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in
            trouble.  You worthless bastard.
            I'll cripple your ass for this!
            All that shit in the car is yours!
            You understand that?  When I finish
            testifying out here you'll be
            disbarred!

INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

                         GONZO
            You're supposed to be in Vegas.  We
            have a suite at the Flamingo.  I
            was just about to leave for the
            airport.

INT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.

                         GONZO'S VOICE
            You brainless scumbag!  You're
            supposed to be covering the National
            District Attorney's conference!  I
            made all the reservations... rented
            a white Cadillac convertible... the
            whole thing is arranged!  What the
            hell are you doing out there in the
            middle of the fucking desert?

                                                           62.


DUKE stares at the telegram.

                         DUKE
            Never mind.  It's all a big joke.
            I'm actually sitting beside the
            pool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking
            from a portable phone.  Some dwarf
            brought it out from the casino.  I
            have total credit!  Can you grasp
            that?
                   (shouts)
            Don't come anywhere near this place!
            Foreigners aren't welcome here!

DUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

C/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Well.  This is how the world works.

C/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            All energy flows according to the
            whims of the Great Magnet.

C/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert
dirt.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            What a fool I was to defy Him.

The IGUANA sits unfazed.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Never cross the Great Magnet.  I
            understood this now...
                   (another blast from
                   the gun)
            ... and with understanding came a
            sense of almost terminal relief.

DUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the
thuds of the explosions echo away.

EXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY

The RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.

                                                           63.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            I had to get rid of The Shark.  Too
            many people might recognize it...
            ...especially the Vegas Police.
                   (tight C/U of DUKE)
            Luckily, my credit card was still
            technically valid.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

DUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE
WHITE WHALE.

DUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            This was a superior machine -- ten
            grand worth of gimmicks and high
            price special effects.  The rear
            windows leapt up with a touch like
            frogs in a dynamited pond.  The
            dashboard was full of esoteric
            lights and dials and meters that I
            would never understand.

EXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON

A GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S
CONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            If the Pigs were gathering in
            Vegas, I felt the Drug Culture
            should be represented as well...
            and there was a certain bent appeal
            in the notion of running a savage
            burn on one Las Vegas hotel and
            then just wheeling across town and
            checking into another.

The WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately
attended by impressed MINIONS.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Me and a thousand ranking cops from
            all over America.  Why not?  Move
            confidently into their midst.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco
shirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden
behind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.

                                                           64.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            My arrival was badly timed.

THE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all
dressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,
Arnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.

Ahead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.
The POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,
weeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.

                         POLICE CHIEF
            What do you mean I'm too late to
            register?  I'm a police chief.
            From Michigan.  Look, fella, I told
            you.
                   (waves a POSTCARD)
            I have a postcard here that says I
            have reservations in this hotel.

                         CLERK
                   (prissily)
            I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the
            "late list." Your reservations were
            transferred to the... ah...
            Moonlight Motel, which is out on
            Paradise Boulevard...

                         POLICE CHIEF
            I've already paid for my goddamn
            room!

                         CLERK
            It's actually a very fine place of
            lodging and only sixteen blocks
            from here, with its own pool and...

                         POLICE CHIEF
            You dirty little faggot!  Call the
            manager!  I'm tired of listening to
            this dogshit!

FRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.

                         CLERK
                   (solicitously)
            I'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you
            a cab?

The POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Of course, I could hear what the
            Clerk was really saying...

                                                           65.


                         CLERK
                   (IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)
            Listen, you fuzzy little shithead --
            I've been fucked around, in my
            time, by a fairly good cross-
            section of mean-tempered rule-crazy
            cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck
            you, officer, I'm in charge here,
            and I'm telling you we don't have
            room for you."

DUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.

                         DUKE
            Say.  I hate to interrupt, but I
            wonder if maybe I could just sort
            of slide through and get out of
            your way.  Name's Raoul Duke --
            Raoul Duke.  My attorney made the
            reservation.

DUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE
goes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he
was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The
CLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.

                         CLERK
            Certainly, Mr. Duke!

                         DUKE
            My bags are out there in that white
            Cadillac convertible.  Can you have
            someone drive it around to the room?

ALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.

                         DUKE
            Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild
            Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and
            a night's worth of ice delivered to
            my room, please?

                         CLERK
            Don't worry about a thing, sir.
            Just enjoy your stay.

                         DUKE
            Well, thank you.

DUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the
elevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of
beer and toasts them.  The doors close.

                                                           66.


INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY

DUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.

                         DUKE
            Ah, home at last!

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.

A 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.

GONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a
drug-addled grin on his face.

                         DUKE
            You degenerate pig!

                         GONZO
            It can't be helped.  This is Lucy.
                   (laughing distractedly)
            You know--like "Lucy In The Sky
            With Diamonds."

LUCY eyes DUKE venomously.

                         GONZO
            Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!
            Remember what happened at the
            airport!  No more of that, okay?

LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his
arm round her shoulder.

                         GONZO
            Lucy... this is my client.  This is
            Mr. Duke, the famous journalist.
            He's paying for this suite, Lucy.
            He's on our side.

DUKE flops onto the sofa.

                         GONZO
            Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves
            artists.

DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of
artwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in
charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.

                         GONZO
            Lucy paints portraits of Barbra
            Streisand.

                                                           67.


                         LUCY
            I drew these from TV.

                         GONZO
            Fantastic.  She came all the way
            down here from Montana just to give
            these portraits to Barbra.  We're
            going over to the Americana Hotel
            tonight to meet her backstage...

DUKE's voice rises above GONZO.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I desperately needed peace, rest,
            sanctuary.  I hadn't counted on
            this.  Finding my attorney on acid
            and locked into some kind of
            preternatural courtship.

                         DUKE
            Well, I guess they brought the car
            round by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF
            OUT OF THE TRUNK.

DUKE fixes GONZO hard.

                         GONZO
            Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.
                   (to LUCY)
            Now, we'll be right back.  Don't
            answer the phone if it rings.

                         LUCY
                   (makes one-fingered
                   Jesus freak sign)
            God bless.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY

DUKE collars GONZO -- serious.

                         DUKE
            WELL?  What are your plans?

                         GONZO
            Plans?

                         DUKE
            Lucy.

                                                           68.


                         GONZO
                   (struggling to focus)
            Shit.  I met her on the plane and I
            had all that acid.
                   (he shrugs)
            You know, those little blue barrels.
            I gave her a cap before I realized...
            she's a religious freak... Jesus,
            she's never even had a drink.

                         DUKE
            Well... It'll probably work out.
            We can keep her loaded and peddle
            her ass at the drug convention.

GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.

                         GONZO
            Listen, she's running away from
            home for something like the fifth
            time in six months.  It's terrible.

                         DUKE
            She's perfect for this gig.  These
            cops will go fifty bucks a head to
            beat her into submission and then
            gang fuck her.  We can set her up
            in one of these back street motels,
            hang pictures of Jesus all over the
            room, then turn these pigs loose on
            her... Hell she's strong; she'll
            hold her own.

GONZO's face twitches badly.

                         GONZO
            Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick
            but I never expected to hear you
            actually say that kind of stuff.

                         DUKE
            It's straight economics.  This girl
            is a god-send.  Shit, she can make
            us a grand a day.

                         GONZO
            NO!  Stop talking like that.

                         DUKE
            I figure she can do about four at a
            time.  Christ, if we keep her full
            of acid that's more like two grand
            a day.  Maybe three.

                                                           69.


                         GONZO
            You filthy bastard.  I should cave
            your fucking head in.

                         DUKE
            In a few hours, she'll probably be
            sane enough to work herself into a
            towering Jesus-based rage at the
            hazy recollection of being seduced
            by some kind of cruel Samoan who
            fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her
            to a Vegas hotel room and savagely
            penetrated every orifice in her
            body with his throbbing,
            uncircumcised member.

GONZO starts crying.

                         GONZO
            NO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I
            wanted to help her!

                         DUKE
            You'll go straight to the gas
            chamber.  And even if you manage to
            beat that, they'll send you back to
            Nevada for Rape and Consensual
            Sodomy.  She's got to go.

Pause.

                         GONZO
            Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help
            somebody these days.

A silence.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The only alternative was to take
            her out to the desert and feed her
            remains to the lizards.  But, it
            seemed a bit heavy for the thing we
            were trying to protect: My attorney.

                         GONZO
            We have to cut her loose.  She's
            got two hundred dollars.  And we
            can always call the cops up there
            in Montana, where she lives, and
            turn her in.

                         DUKE
            What?... What kind of goddamn
            monster are you?

                                                           70.


                         GONZO
            It just occurred to me, that she
            has no witnesses.  Anything that
            she says about us is completely
            worthless.

                         DUKE
            Us?

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET

DUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.

                         DUKE
            Hotel Americana?  I need a
            reservation.  For my niece.  Listen,
            I need her treated very gently.
            She's an artist, and might seem a
            trifle highstrung...

In the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the
door.

                         GONZO
            Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet
            Barbra...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I felt like a Nazi, but it had to
            be done.

EXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK

The WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps
LUCY and her paintings from the car.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Lucy was a potentially fatal
            millstone on both our necks.  There
            was absolutely no choice but to cut
            her adrift and hope her memory was
            fucked.

GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --
waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting
to come down...

GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands
together as if washing his hands of the situation.

                         GONZO
            Well that's that.  Take off slowly.
            Don't attract attention.

                                                           71.


They pull out into traffic.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK

                         GONZO
            I gave the cabbie an extra ten
            bucks to make sure she gets there
            safe.  Also, I told him I'd be
            there myself in an hour, and if she
            wasn't, I'd come back out here and
            rip his lungs out.

                         DUKE
            That's good.  You can't be subtle
            in this town.

                         GONZO
            As your attorney, I advise you to
            tell me where you put the goddamn
            mescaline.

                         DUKE
            Maybe we should take it easy tonight.

                         GONZO
            Right.  Let's find a good seafood
            restaurant and eat some red salmon.
            I feel a powerful lust for red
            salmon...

The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The
sun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson
tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

GONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.

In the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.

                         DUKE
            Come on, we're going to be late.

GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth
with a towel.

                         GONZO
            This goddamn mescaline.  Why the
            fuck can't they make it a little
            less pure?  Maybe mix it up with
            Rolaids or something.

                                                           72.


INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

                         EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
                   (crackling and
                   booming over the
                   lousy sound system)
            On behalf of the prosecuting
            attorneys of this county, I welcome
            you to the Third National DA's
            Conference on Narcotics and
            Dangerous Drugs.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman
type -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:
NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. "If You Don't Know, Come To
Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach."

A BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS
AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod
dress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be
WITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around
20 REDNECKS.

A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles
distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.

At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI
wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name
tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.

GONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,
CRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.

                         GONZO
                   (lowers his voice)
            I saw these bastards in Easy Rider,
            but I didn't believe they were real.
            Not like this.  Not hundreds of them!

                         DUKE
            They're actually nice people when
            you get to know them.

                         GONZO
            Man, I know these people in my
            goddamn blood!

                         DUKE
            Don't mention that word around here.
            You'll get them excited.

                         GONZO
            This is a fucking nightmare.

                                                           73.


                         DUKE
            Right.  Sure as hell some dope-
            dealing bomb freak is going to
            recognize you and put the word out
            that you're partying with a thousand
            cops.

                         COP IN BACK
            SSSSHHH!

DR. BLUMQUIST -- a "drug expert" -- takes the stage.

                         DR. BLUMQUIST
            We must come to terms with the Drug
            Culture in the country... country...
            country...

The sound systems echoes.

                         DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
            The reefer butt is called a "roach,"
            because it resembles a cockroach...
            cockroach... cockroach...

                         GONZO
                   (whispers)
            What the fuck are these people
            talking about?  You'd have to be
            crazy on acid to think a joint
            looked like a goddamn cockroach!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It was clear that we had stumbled
            into a prehistoric gathering.

                         DR. BLUMQUIST
            Now, there are four states of being
            in the cannabis, or marijuana,
            society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and
            Square.  The square is seldom if
            ever cool.  He is not "with it,"
            that is, he doesn't know "what's
            happening." But if he manages to
            figure it out, he moves up a notch
            to "hip."

DUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.

                         DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
            And if he can bring himself to
            approve of what is happening, he
            becomes "groovy." After that, with
            much luck and perseverance, he can
            rise to the rank of "cool." A cool
            guy... cool guy... cool guy...

                                                           74.


                         COP IN BACK
            Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the
            anthropologist, Margaret Mead's
            strange behavior of late might
            possibly be explained by a private
            marijuana addiction?

                         DR. BLUMQUIST
            I really don't know, but at her
            age, if she did smoke grass, she'd
            have one hell of a trip!

Roars of laughter.

                         GONZO
            I know a hell of a lot better ways
            to waste my time than listening to
            this bullshit.

He stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and
plunges down the aisle to the door.

                         COP IN BACK
            Down in front!

                         GONZO
            Fuck you!  I have to get out!  I
            don't belong here!

                         COP IN BACK
            Good riddance!

He stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to
the stage.

The lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER
MADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.

                         FILM NARRATOR
            KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE
            MAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be
            able to see his eyes because of
            Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will
            be white from inner tension...

DUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF
who necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.

                         FILM NARRATOR
            ... and his pants will be crusted
            with semen from constantly jacking
            off when he can't find a rape
            victim...

                                                           75.


DUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,
he gets up, hand over mouth.

                         DUKE
            Pardon me, I feel sick.

                         FILM NARRATOR
            He will stagger and babble when
            questioned.  He will not respect
            your badge.  The Dope Fiend fears
            nothing.  He will attack, for no
            reason, with every weapon at his
            command -- including yours...

DUKE heads for the exit.

                         DUKE
            Sorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling
            sick...

                         FILM NARRATOR
            BEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a
            suspected marijuana addict should
            use all necessary force immediately.
            One stitch in time [on him] will
            usually save nine on you.

DUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.

INT. CASINO BAR - DAY

DUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING
COP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT
ATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.

                         DA
            I'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't
            have much trouble from drugs where
            I come from...

                         GONZO
            You will.  One of these nights
            you'll wake up and find a junkie
            tearing your bedroom apart.

                         DA
            Naw!

                         GONZO
            They'll climb right into your
            bedroom and sit on your chest with
            big Bowie knives.  They might even
            sit on your wife's chest.  Put the
            blade right down on her throat.

                                                           76.


                         DA
            Not down in my parts.

DUKE joins them.

                         DUKE
                   (to WAITRESS)
            Rum and ice, please.

                         DA
                   (looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)
            You're another one of these
            California boys.  Your friend
            here's been tellin' us about dope
            fiends.

                         DUKE
            They're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.
            And sure as hell not in the South.
            They like warm weather... You'd
            never believe it.  In L.A. it's out
            of control.  First it was drugs,
            now it's witchcraft.

                         DA
            Witchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!

The BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the
conversation.

                         GONZO
            Read the newspapers.

                         DUKE
            Man, you don't know trouble until
            you have to face down a bunch of
            these addicts gone crazy for human
            sacrifice!

                         DA
            Naw!  That's science fiction stuff!

                         DUKE
            Not where we operate.

                         GONZO
            Hell, in Malibu alone, these
            goddamn Satan worshippers kill six
            or eight people every day.  All
            they want is the blood.  They'll
            take people right off the street if
            they have to.

                                                           77.


                         DUKE
            Just the other day we had a case
            where they grabbed a girl right out
            of a McDonald's hamburger stand.
            She was a waitress, about sixteen
            years old... with a lot of people
            watching, too!

The BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more
furiously.

                         DA
            What happened?  What did they do to
            her?

                         GONZO
            Do?  Jesus Christ, man.  They
            chopped her goddamn head off right
            there in the parking lot!  Then
            they cut all kinds of holes in her
            head and sucked out the blood!

                         DA
                   (DA ad-libs a
                   summation of the crime)
            And nobody did anything?

                         DUKE
            What could they do?  The guy that
            took the head was about six-seven,
            and maybe three-hundred pounds.  He
            was packing two Lugers, and the
            others had M-16s.

                         GONZO
            They just ran back out into Death
            Valley -- you know, where Manson
            turned up...

                         DUKE
            Like big lizards.

                         GONZO
            ... and every one of them stacked
            naked...

                         DA
            Naked!?

                         DUKE
            Naked.

                                                           78.


                         GONZO
            Yeh, naked!... except for the
            weapons.

                         DUKE
            They were all veterans.

                         DA
            Veterans?!!!?

Agog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes
the glass -- faster and faster...

                         GONZO
            Yeh.  The big guy used to be a
            major in the Marines.

                         DA
            A major!

                         GONZO
            We know where he lives, but we
            can't get near the house.

                         DA
            Naw!  Not a major.

                         GONZO
            He wanted the pineal gland.

                         DA
            Really?

                         GONZO
            That's how he got so big.  When he
            quit the Marines he was just a
            little guy.

                         DUKE
            Usually, it's whole families.
            During the night.  Most of them
            don't even wake up until they feel
            their heads going -- and then, of
            course, it's too late.

The glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.

                         DUKE (CONT'D)
            Happens every day.

DUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.

                                                           79.


                         DUKE (CONT'D)
            Three more rums.  Plenty of ice.
            Maybe a handful of lime chunks.

                         WAITRESS
            Are you guys with the police
            convention upstairs?

                         DA
            We sure are, Miss.

                         WAITRESS
            I thought so.  I never heard that
            kind of talk around here before.
            Jesus Christ!  How do you guys
            stand that kind of work?

                         GONZO
                   (grinning)
            We like it.  It's groovy.

The WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.

                         DUKE
            What's wrong with you?  Hell,
            somebody has to do it.

                         GONZO
            Hurry up with those drinks.  We're
            thirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine
            a Bloody Mary.

                         DA
                   (whacks his fist on
                   the bar)
            Hell, I really hate to hear this.
            Because everything that happens in
            California seems to get down our
            way, sooner or later.  Mostly
            Atlanta.  But that was back when
            the goddamn bastards were peaceful.
            All we had to do was to keep 'em
            under surveillance.  They didn't
            roam around much... But now Jesus,
            it seems nobody's safe.

                         GONZO
                   (with a conspiratorial
                   nod)
            You're going to need to take the
            bull by the horns -- go to the mat
            with this scum.

                                                           80.


                         DA
            What do you mean by that?

                         GONZO
            You know what I mean.  We've done
            it before and we can damn well do
            it again!

                         DUKE
            Cut their goddamn heads off.  Every
            one of them.  That's what we're
            doing in California.

                         DA
                   (stupefied)
            WHAT?

                         GONZO
            Sure.  It's all on the Q.T., but
            everybody who matters is with us
            all the way down the line.

                         DUKE
            We keep it quiet.  It's not the
            kind of thing you'd want to talk
            about upstairs.  Not with the press
            around.

                         DA
                   (recovering slightly)
            Hell, no.  We'd never hear the
            goddamn end of it.

                         DUKE
            Dobermans don't talk.

                         DA
            What?

                         GONZO
            Sometimes it's easier to just rip
            out the backstraps.

                         DUKE
            They'll fight like hell if you try
            to take the head without the dogs.

                         DA
            God almighty!
                   (muttering in a daze)
            I don't think I should tell my wife
            about this.  She'd never understand.
            You know how women are.

                                                           81.


DUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.

                         DUKE
            Just be thankful your heart is
            young and strong.

DUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the
swirling ice in drink.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.

GONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the
bathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.

The phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,
picks up the phone.

                         DUKE
            What's the message?  My light is
            blinking.

                         CLERK (V/O)
            Ah, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one
            message: "Call Lucy at the Americana
            Hotel, room 1600."

                         DUKE
            Holy shit!

DUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the
bathroom -- looking like death.

                         DUKE
            Lucy called.

GONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.

                         GONZO
            What?

The telephone rings.  DUKE answers.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY

A worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.

                         CLERK
            Mr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm
            sorry we were cut off a moment
            ago... I thought I should call
            again, because I was wondering...

                                                           82.


INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY

                         DUKE
            WHAT?
                   (hand over the PHONE)
            What was that crazy bitch said to
            him?
                   (screams)
            There's a war on, man!  People are
            being killed!

                         CLERK (V/O)
            Killed?

                         DUKE
            IN VIETNAM!  ON THE GODDAMN
            TELEVISION!

                         CLERK (V/O)
            Oh... yes... yes... This terrible
            war.  When will it end?

                         DUKE
            Tell me.  What do you want?

In the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his
stash from the lining.

                         CLERK (V/O)
            The woman who left that message for
            you sounded very disturbed.  I
            think she was crying...

                         DUKE
            Crying?  Why was she crying?

                         CLERK (V/O)
            Well, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.
            But since I know you're here with
            the Police Convention...

                         DUKE
            Look, you want to be gentle with
            that woman if she ever calls again.
            We're watching her very carefully...
            this woman has been into laudanum.
            It's a controlled experiment, but I
            suspect we'll need your cooperation
            before this thing is over.

                         CLERK (V/O)
                   (hesitantly)
            Well, certainly... We're always
            happy to cooperate with the police...

                                                           83.


                         DUKE
            Don't worry.  You're protected.
            Just treat this poor woman like
            you'd treat any other human being
            in trouble.

                         CLERK (V/O)
            What?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what
            you mean... Yes... so, you'll be
            responsible then?

                         DUKE
            Of course.  And now I have to get
            back to the news.  Send up some ice.

He hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.

                         GONZO
            Good work.  They'll treat us like
            goddamn lepers after that.

                         DUKE
                   (slowly, carefully)
            Lucy is looking for you.

                         GONZO
                   (laughing)
            No, she's looking for you.

                         DUKE
            Me?

                         GONZO
            She really flipped over you.  The
            only way I could get rid of her was
            by saying you were taking me out to
            the desert for a showdown -- that
            you wanted me out of the way so you
            could have her all to yourself.
                   (laughing again)
            I guess she figures you won.  That
            phone message wasn't for me, was it?

A look of stunned realization from DUKE...

INT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY

LUCY is on the witness stand.

                         LUCY
            Yessir, those two men in the dock
            are the ones who gave me the LSD
            and took me to the hotel.

                                                           84.


A doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate.

                         LUCY
            I don't know for sure what they
            done to me, but I remember it was
            horrible.

                         JUDGE
            Twenty years... and Double
            Castration!

The JUDGE bangs his gavel.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

DUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase.

                         GONZO
            Wait!  You can't leave me alone in
            this snake pit.  This room is in my
            name.

DUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried.

                         GONZO
            OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call
            her.  I'll get her off our backs.
            You're right.  She's my problem.

                         DUKE
            It's gone too far.

                         GONZO
            Relax.  Let me handle this.
                   (dials the PHONE,
                   snaps angrily at DUKE)
            You'd make a piss-poor lawyer.
            ...Room 1600, please.
                   (to DUKE)
            As your attorney, I advise you not
            to worry.
                   (nods towards bathroom)
            Take a hit out of that little brown
            bottle in my shaving kit.

DUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a
label: "DRINK ME."

                         DUKE
            What is this?

                                                           85.


                         GONZO
            You won't need much.  Just a little
            tiny taste, that stuff makes pure
            mescaline seem like ginger-beer.
            Adrenochrome.

DUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.

                         DUKE
            Adrenochrome...

                         GONZO
                   (into PHONE)
            Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got
            your message...what?  Hell, no, I
            taught the bastard a lesson he'll
            never forget... what?  No, not
            dead, but he won't be bothering
            anybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left
            him out there, I stomped him, then
            pulled all his teeth out...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a
            terrible thing to lay on somebody
            with a head full of acid."

DUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies
it -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...

                         GONZO
                   (to PHONE)
            But here's the problem.  That
            bastard cashed a bad check
            downstairs and gave you as a
            reference.  They'll be looking for
            both of you.  Yeah, I know, but you
            can't judge a book by its cover,
            Lucy.  Some people are just
            basically rotten... Anyway, the
            last thing you want to do is call
            this hotel again; they'll trace the
            call and put you straight behind
            bars... no, I'm moving to the
            Tropicana right away.  I have to
            go, they've got the phone tapped.
            Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but
            it's all over now... OH MY GOD!
            THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!
                   (throws the PHONE
                   down; shouts)
            No!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent!
            It was Duke!  I swear to God!
                         (MORE)

                                                           86.


                         GONZO (CONT'D)
                   (stomps the PHONE; moans)
            No, I don't know where she is.
            You'll never catch Lucy!  She's
            gone!  I swear, I don't know where
            she is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!
                   (slams the PHONE down)


GONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.

                         GONZO
            Well.  That's that.  She's probably
            stuffing herself down the
            incinerator about now.  That's the
            last we should be hearing from Lucy.
                   (fumbling with the
                   hash pipe)
            Where's the opium?

DUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY
STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I remember slumping on the bed, his
            performance had given me a bad jolt.
            For a moment I thought his mind had
            snapped -- that he actually believed
            he was being attacked by invisible
            enemies.  But the room was quiet
            again.

DUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.

                         DUKE
            Where'd you get this?

                         GONZO
            Never mind, it's absolutely pure.

                         DUKE
            Jesus... what kind of monster
            client have you picked up this time?
            There's only one source for this
            stuff -- the adrenaline gland from
            a living human body!

GONZO turns to smile at DUKE.

                                                           87.


                         GONZO
            I know, but the guy didn't have any
            cash to pay me.  He's one of these
            Satanism freaks.  He offered me
            human blood -- said it would take
            me higher than I've ever been in my
            life.
                   (laughs -- struts
                   round DUKE -- eyes
                   bright with expectation)
            I thought he was kidding, so I told
            him I'd just as soon have an ounce
            or so of pure adrenochrome -- or
            maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland
            to chew on.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I could already feel the stuff
            working on me -- the first wave
            felt like a combination of mescaline
            and methedrine -- maybe I should
            take a swim, I thought...

DUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...

                         GONZO
            Yeah, they nailed this guy for
            child molesting.  He swore he
            didn't do it. "Why should I fuck
            with children?" he says. "They're
            too small." Christ, werewolf is
            entitled to legal counsel.  I
            didn't dare turn the creep down.
            He might have picked up a letter
            opener and gone after my pineal
            gland!

GONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS
GOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.

                         DUKE
            Why not?  We should get some of
            that.  Just eat a big handful and
            see what happens.

                         GONZO
            Some of what?

                         DUKE
                   (spitting words)
            Extract of pineal!

                                                           88.


                         GONZO
                   (STARING AT DUKE WITH
                   A STRANGE SMILE)
            Sure.  That's a good idea.  One
            whiff of that shit would turn you
            into something out of a goddamn
            medical encyclopedia.

GONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.

                         GONZO
            Man, your head would swell up like
            a watermelon, you'd probably gain
            about a hundred pounds in two
            hours...

A CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.

                         DUKE
            Right!

                         GONZO
            ... grow claws... bleeding warts.

GONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.

                         DUKE
            Yes!

                         GONZO
            ... then you'd notice about six
            huge hairy tits swelling up on your
            back...

A TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A
FLAME RED DEMON!

                         DUKE
            Fantastic!

DUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY
at the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His
heels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,
EYEBALLS SWELLING.

GONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.

                         GONZO
            you'd go blind... your body would
            turn to wax... they'd have to put
            you in a wheelbarrow and...

GONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals
GONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.

                                                           89.


                         GONZO
            Man I'll try about anything; but
            I'd never touch a pineal gland.

                         DUKE
            FINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What
            happened?!  What about the glands?

GONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...
towards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...

                         GONZO
            Jesus, that stuff got right on top
            of you, didn't it.

VEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red.
OVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!

                         DUKE
            Maybe you could just... shove me
            into the pool, or something...

GONZO shakes his head disgustedly.

                         GONZO
            If I put you in the pool right now,
            you'd sink like a goddamn stone.
            You took too much.  Jesus, look at
            your face, you're about to explode.

GONZO sits back down... watching the TV.

                         GONZO
            Don't try and fight it, or you'll
            get brain bubbles.  Strokes,
            aneurysms.  You'll just wither up
            and die.

DUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO
PARALYSIS.

AND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF
RICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.

                         NIXON
            Sacrifice... sacrifice...
            sacrifice...

DUKE PASSES OUT.

BLACK SCREEN

                                                           90.


INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Darkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- "Put the
lime in the coconut and mix em all up..."

                         DUKE (V/O)
            What kind of rat-bastard psychotic
            would play that song -- right now,
            at this moment?

DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies,
awkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been
there days -- months.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            When I came to the general back
            alley ambiance of the suite was so
            rotten, so incredibly foul.  How
            long had I been lying there?  Hours?
            Days?  Months?  All these signs of
            violence.  What had happened?

DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE
SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving
whisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights
replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,
pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered
on a shattered mirror.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was evidence in this room of
            excessive consumption of almost
            every type of drug known to
            civilized man since 1544 AD.

DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --
HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            But what kind of addict would need
            all these coconut husks and crushed
            honeydew rinds?  Would the presence
            of junkies account for all these
            uneaten french fries?  These
            puddles of glazed ketchup on the
            bureau?  Maybe so, but then why all
            this booze?  And these crude
            pornographic photos smeared with
            mustard that had dried to a hard
            yellow crust...

DUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT
RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.

                                                           91.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            These were not the hoof prints of
            your normal god-fearing junkie.  It
            was too savage, too aggressive.

QUICK FLASHBACK:

GONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:

BACK IN THE ROOM:

DUKE stares at the smashed mirror.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Grim memories and bad flashbacks.

In the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN
VOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.

DUKE unzips and pisses.  THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE
MAGNUM .357!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Something ugly had happened.  I was
            sure of it...

DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.

The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.

DUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out
of the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE
SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...
sleeping on the sofa.

The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.

A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO
grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is
muffling her screams with an ice bag.

                         MAID
            Please... please... I'm only the
            maid.  I didn't mean nothin!...

                         DUKE
                   (jumps up from the
                   bed, flashing his
                   press badge)
            YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

                                                           92.


                         GONZO
                   (to DUKE)
            She must have used a pass key.  I
            was polishing my shoes in the
            closet when I noticed her sneaking
            in-so I took her.

DUKE shakes his head.

                         DUKE
                   (barks at the MAID)
            What made you do it?  Who paid you
            off?

                         MAID
            Nobody.  I'm the maid!

                         GONZO
            You're lying!  You were after the
            evidence.  Who put you up to
            this -- the manager?

                         MAID
            I don't know what you're talking
            about!

                         GONZO
            Bullshit!  You're just as much a
            part of it as they are!

                         MAID
            Part of what?

                         DUKE
            The dope ring.  You must know
            what's going on in this hotel.  Why
            do you think we're here?

                         MAID
                   (blubbering)
            I know you're cops, but I thought
            you were just here for that
            convention.  I swear!  All I wanted
            to do was clean up the room.  I
            don't know anything about dope!

GONZO laughs.

                         GONZO
            Come on, baby don't try to tell us
            you never heard of the Grange Gorman.

                                                           93.


                         MAID
            No!  No!  I swear to Jesus I never
            heard of that stuff!

                         DUKE
            Maybe she's telling the truth.
            Maybe she's not part of it.

                         MAID
            No!  I swear I'm not!

                         GONZO
                   (long pause)
            In that case, maybe she can help.

                         MAID
            Yes!  I'll help you all you need!
            I hate dope!

                         DUKE
            So do we, lady.

                         GONZO
                   (helping her up)
            I think we should put her on the
            payroll.  See what she comes up with.

                         DUKE
            Do you think you can handle it?

                         MAID
            What?

                         GONZO
            One phone call every day.  Just
            tell us what you've seen.  Don't
            worry if it doesn't add up, that's
            our problem.

GONZO hustles the MAID to the door.

                         MAID
            You'd pay me for that?

                         DUKE
            You're damn right.  But the first
            time you say anything about this,
            to anybody -- you'll go straight to
            prison for the rest of your life.
            What's your name?

                         MAID
            Alice.  Just ring Linen Service and
            ask for Alice.

                                                           94.


                         GONZO
            Alright, Alice... you'll be
            contacted by Inspector Rock.
            Arthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a
            politician.

                         DUKE
            Inspector Rock will pay you.  In
            cash.  A thousand dollars on the
            ninth of every month.

                         MAID
            Oh Lord!  I'd do just about anything
            for that!

                         GONZO
            You and a lot of other people.

                         DUKE
            The password is: "One Hand Washes
            The Other." The minute you hear
            that, you say "I fear nothing."

                         MAID
            I fear nothing.

She repeats the password several times while they listen to
make sure she has it right.

                         GONZO
            Oh, and don't bother to make up the
            room.  That way we won't have to
            risk another of these little
            incidents, will we?

                         MAID
            Whatever you say, gentlemen.  I
            can't tell you how sorry I am about
            what happened...

                         GONZO
            Don't worry, it's all over now.
            Thank God for the decent people.

She smiles, repeating to herself "One Hand Washes The Other"
as GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.

CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.

A grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.

                         GONZO ON TAPE
            ... Thank God for the decent people.

                                                           95.


DUKE sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his
mangled tape recorder in front of him.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Memories of that night are extremely
            hazy...

DUKE fast forwards through the tape -- SEARCHING: "Awwww,
mama... can this really...be the end...?"

EXT. SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET - DAY

The WHITE WHALE waits -- gleaming -- beautiful.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There is a definite obligation,
            when you boom around Vegas in a
            white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a
            certain style.

DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping
basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They
send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.

The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather
at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with
junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.

DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects
a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO
pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering
CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!

A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.

DUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat
flies everywhere.

                         SHOPPER #1
            Hey!  Is that your car?

                         DUKE
            Sure is.

SMASH!  Coconut fragments fly.

                         DUKE
            Any of you folks want the milk?
            We're after the meat.  This is
            honest coconut essence.  Real meat.

SMASH!

                                                           96.


                         SHOPPER #2
            Meat, hell!  Look what you're doing
            to that car!

                         GONZO
            Fuck the car.  They should make
            these things with a goddamn FM radio.

SMASH!

                         DUKE
            Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is
            sucking our dollar balance dry!

                         SHOPPER #3
            Someone should stop them!

SMASH!

                         DUKE
            You poor fools don't understand, do
            you?  This car is the property of
            the World Bank!  That money goes to
            ITALY!

                         SHOPPER #3
            Somebody should call the police!

                         GONZO
            Police?  Are you people crazy?

GONZO confronts the CROWD, hammer in one hand, a coconut in
the other.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
            You folks every heard of ole
            Patrick Henry?  Know what he said?!

Silence -- the CROWD uncomprehending of this STONE DEGENERATE.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
                   (ROARS)
            GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!

GONZO brings the hammer down on the hood.  CLANG!

A gasp from the CROWD.  Getting ugly.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
            In Samoa we LOVE THE CONSTITUTION!

                         SHOPPER #3
            Bullshit.

                                                           97.


The CROWD move in.

                         SHOPPER #1
            Call the goddamn police!

GONZO SWINGS THE HAMMER.  CLANG!

                         SHOPPER #4
            Look what they've done to that
            beautiful car!

DUKE jumps in behind the wheel.

                         DUKE
            This crowd is not rational.  They
            can't relate to us.  Let's go!

A final CLANG!  GONZO jumps in.

DUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD.

                         DUKE
            You people voted for Hubert Humphrey!
            You killed Jesus!

They swerve round and through the CROWD.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The crowd broke ranks.  Nobody
            wants to be run over by a Coupe de
            Ville.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE FAST-FORWARDS... PLAYS THE TAPE...

                         VOICE ON TAPE
            You found the American Dream?  In
            this town?

                         DUKE ON TAPE
            We're sitting on the main nerve
            right now...

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO (wearing a single black glove) talk
conspiratorially to a 3RD MAN.  A PLACID ORANGUTAN in a bow
tie sits next to him.  THE BAR IS REVOLVING FASTER THAN
NORMAL.  DUKE IS INSANELY TALKATIVE -- WIRED!

                                                           98.


                         DUKE
            The manager told me a story about
            the owner of this place...about how
            he always wanted to run away and
            join the circus when he was a kid.
            Well, now the bastard has his own
            circus, and a license to steal, too.

                         3RD MAN
            You're right -- he's the model.

                         DUKE
            Absolutely!  Pure Horatio Alger...
            Say...

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE playing the tape.

                         DUKE ON TAPE
            ... how much do you think he'd take
            for the ape?

DUKE fast-forwards again -- searching... TRAFFIC NOISES.
SCREECH OF BRAKES.

                         VOICE ON TAPE
            Holy God!...

A TERRIBLE GRINDING NOISE.

EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

                         RENTAL AGENT
            Holy God!, how did this happen?

                         DUKE
            They beat the shit out of it.

                         RENTAL AGENT
            The top's completely jammed!

The CAR RENTAL AGENT wrestles with the trashed car.

                         DUKE
            Yeah, something's wrong with the
            motor...

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

                         DUKE ON TAPE
            ... The generator light's been on
            red ever since I drove the thing
            into Lake Mead on a water test...

                                                           99.


A HUGE SPLASH...

The tape's gone too far.

                         DUKE
            No, no.  Shit...

DUKE races the tape BACKWARDS... Then, SIRENS HOWL.

                         DUKE ON TAPE
            Where's the ape?  I'm ready to
            write a check.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS BAR - NIGHT

DUKE is standing in the middle of A SEMI-DESTROYED BAZOOKO
CIRCUS REVOLVING BAR.  Mirrors are broken.  People are
recovering from some kind of battle.  THE BAR SPINS MADLY.
DUKE IS INSANELY WIRED.

                         3RD MAN
            Forget it, he just attacked an old
            man... he took a bite out of the
            bartender's head!  The cops took
            the ape away.

                         DUKE
            Goddamnit!  What's the bail?  I
            want that ape!  I've already
            reserved two first-class seats on
            the plane.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was every reason to believe
            that we had been heading for
            trouble, that we'd pushed our luck
            a bit far...

INT. WHITE WHALE ON THE STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

GONZO SCREAMS ABUSE out of the window at a Ford alongside
the VOMIT STREAKED WHITE WHALE.  DUKE MAKES A SUPERHUMAN
EFFORT TO STAY ON THE ROAD.

                         GONZO
            Hey there!  You folks want to buy
            some heroin?

In the Ford: TWO COUPLES -- MIDDLE-AGED AMERICAN FACES
FROZEN IN SHOCK -- stare straight ahead.  GONZO leans out --
close to them.

                                                          100.


                         GONZO
            Hey, honkies!  Goddamnit, I'm
            serious.  I want to sell you some
            pure fucking smack!

No reaction.

                         GONZO
            Cheap heroin!  This is the real
            stuff!  You won't get hooked.  I
            just got back from Vietnam!  This
            is scag, folks.  Pure scag!

The lights change.  The Ford bolts.  DUKE keeps pace with
them.

                         GONZO
            Shoot!  Fuck!  Scag!  Blood!
            Heroin!  Rape!  Cheap!  Communist!
            Jab it right in your fucking
            eyeballs!

The MAN IN THE BACK SEAT suddenly loses control -- enraged,
lunges against the glass, trying to get at GONZO.

                         MAN IN CAR
            You dirty bastards!  Pull over and
            I'll kill you!  God damn you!  You
            bastards!

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

BACK IN THE SUITE:

The tapes runs:

                         MAN IN CAR ON TAPE
            You dirty bastards!

An ugly squeal of brakes.

                         GONZO ON TAPE
            Shit, he was trying to bite me!  I
            shoulda maced the fucker!

DUKE fast forwards the tape.  The TAPE MANGLES -- the sounds
ski to a halt...

DUKE grabs the nearest tool -- uses it to hook out the tape,
then realizes... IT'S GONZO'S RAZOR-SHARP FOLDING KNIFE... A
CHILLING MOMENT...

DUKE turns the knife over... THERE'S A DRIED CRIMSON SPOT ON
THE BLADE... OR IS IT DRIED MASHED POTATOES?

                                                          101.


READ ON TO FIND OUT!

                         DUKE
                   (remembering)
            Back door beauty!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The mentality of Las Vegas is so
            grossly atavistic that a really
            massive crime often slips by
            unrecognized.

DUKE SCRAPS A LITTLE OF THE CRUST -- TASTES IT...

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            The possibility of physical and
            mental collapse is very real... No
            sympathy for the devil; keep that
            in mind.  Buy the ticket, take the
            ride...

HE HEARS THE SOUNDS OF SOMEONE BEHIND BEATEN UP...

                         VOICE OFF
            Shit!  Faggot!  Bastard!

EXT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

WHACK!  SHADOWY FIGURES beat up a MAN -- give him A GOOD
KICKING.  BRUTAL AND UGLY.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            North Vegas is where you go when
            you've fucked up once too often on
            The Strip and when you're not even
            welcome in the cut-rate Downtown
            places.

PAN to reveal a seedy diner -- THE NORTH STAR CAFE in the
background.  Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the
counter.

INT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed
            like a fairly safe haven from our
            storms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just
            a place to rest and regroup.  I
            wasn't even hungry.

GONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE
BEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper.

                                                          102.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was nothing in the atmosphere
            of the North Star to put me on my
            guard...

                         GONZO
                   (to WAITRESS)
            Two glasses of ice water with ice.

The WAITRESS brings the ice water.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            She looked like a burnt out
            caricature of Jane Russell.  She
            was definitely in charge here...

GONZO gulps down his glass of water and hands her a napkin.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            He did it very casually, but I knew
            that our peace was about to be
            shattered.

                         DUKE
            What was that?

GONZO shrugs.

The WAITRESS stands at the end of the counter with her back
to them while she ponders the napkin... She turns.

                         WAITRESS
            What is this?

                         GONZO
            A napkin.

THE WAITRESS slams the napkin down on the counter.

                         WAITRESS
            Don't give me that bullshit!  I
            know what it means!  You goddamn
            fat pimp bastard.

                         GONZO
            That's the name of a horse I used
            to own.  What's wrong with you?

                         WAITRESS
            You sonofabitch!  I take a lot of
            shit in this place, but I sure as
            hell don't have to take it off a
            SPIC PIMP!

                                                          103.


GONZO GOES VERY VERY STILL AT THIS...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Jesus.  I thought, what's happening?

DUKE picks up the napkin.  On it is printed in careful red
letters: "BACK DOOR BEAUTY?"

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            The question mark was emphasized.

                         WAITRESS
                   (screams)
            Pay your bill and get the hell out!
            You want me to call the cops?

                         GONZO
            Spic pimp?

GONZO's hand goes inside his shirt.  He PULLS OUT THE RAZOR-
SHARP HUNTING KNIFE.

GONZO KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE WAITRESS.  He walks about six
feet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone.
He SLICES IT OFF, then brings the receiver back to his stool
and sits down.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I was stupid with shock -- not
            knowing whether to run or start
            laughing.

                         GONZO
                   (casual)
            How much is the lemon meringue pie?

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Her eyes were turgid with fear, but
            her brain was functioning on some
            basic motor survival level.

                         WAITRESS
                   (blurting -- on automatic)
            Thirty-five cents!

                         GONZO
                   (laughing)
            I mean the whole pie.

The WAITRESS MOANS.  GONZO places a $5 BILL on the counter.

                         GONZO
            Let's say five dollars.  Okay?

                                                          104.


GONZO walks round the counter TAKING THE PIE OUT OF THE
DISPLAY CASE.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The sight of the blade had triggered
            bad memories.  The glazed look in
            her eyes said her throat had been
            cut.  She was still in the grip of
            paralysis when we left.

DUKE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT.

GONZO urges him out the door.  The camera retreats with them.

The WAITRESS STANDS THERE -- PETRIFIED.  Alone in a lousy
bar at night.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE's face as he stares at the knife -- remembering...

                         GONZO (V/O)
            Drive!  Drive!  Drive!  We have
            fifteen fucking minutes to get me
            on that plane!

EXT. ROAD ON OUTSKIRTS OF LAS VEGAS - DAY

The WHITE WHALE, looking like shit -- it's TOP HALF UP,
TORN, SLAPPING IN THE WIND -- ROARS THROUGH AN INTERSECTION
as the light turns red.

DR. GONZO FRANTICALLY PAWS OVER A MAP.

DUKE drives -- SILENT AND FURIOUS -- sick to his stomach
with the PSYCHOTIC GONZO.

                         GONZO
            What are you doing?  You were
            supposed to turn back there!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            We had abused every rule that Vegas
            lived by -- burning the locals,
            abusing the tourists, terrifying
            the help.  The only chance now, I
            felt, was the possibility that we'd
            gone to such excess that nobody in
            the position to bring the hammer
            down on us could possibility
            believe it.

DUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.

                                                          105.


                         GONZO
            Jesus Christ!!!

There, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her
paintings under her arm -- looking lost.  SHE LOOKS UP WITH
A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION...

DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS
OFF.

EXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.  GONZO
looks wildly around.

                         GONZO
            Goddamnit!  We're lost!  What are
            we doing out here on this
            godforsaken road?

GONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT
RUNWAY.

                         GONZO
            The airport is over there!

                         DUKE
            Never missed a plane yet.

DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the
WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING,
HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight
up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER
A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the
RUNWAY.

GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He
throws a worried look at DUKE.

                         DUKE
            I'll drop you right next to the
            plane.

They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET
ENGINE SCREAM.

                         GONZO
            No!  I can't get out!  They'll
            crucify me.  I'll have to take the
            blame!

                                                          106.


                         DUKE
                   (irritatedly)
            Ridiculous!  Just say you were
            hitchhiking to the airport and I
            picked you up.  You never saw me
            before.  Shit, this town is full of
            white Cadillac convertibles.  I
            plan to go through there so fast
            that nobody will even glimpse the
            goddamn license plate.  You ready?

                         GONZO
            Why not?  But for Christ's sake,
            just do it fast!

EXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY

DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO
JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.

DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.

                         DUKE
            Hey!

GONZO stops -- turns.

                         DUKE
            Don't take any guff from those
            swine.  Remember, if you have any
            trouble you can always send a
            telegram to the Right People.

                         GONZO
            Yeah... Explaining my Position.
            Some asshole wrote a poem about
            that once...

GONZO pauses.

                         GONZO
            Probably good advice, if you have
            shit for brains.

GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT
TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND
LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There he goes -- one of God's own
            prototypes -- a high powered mutant
            of some kind never even considered
            for mass production.  Too weird to
            live and too rare to die.

                                                          107.


DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH
THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT

On the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find
DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his
typewriter.

                         DUKE
            We are all wired into a survival
            trip now.  No more of the speed
            that fueled that 60's.  That was
            the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.
            He crashed around America selling
            "consciousness expansion" without
            ever giving a thought to the grim
            meat-hook realities that were lying
            in wait for all the people who took
            him seriously...

DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly
rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT
IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.

                         DUKE
            All those pathetically eager acid
            freaks who thought they could buy
            Peace and Understanding for three
            bucks a hit.  But their loss and
            failure is ours too.  What Leary
            took down with him was the central
            illusion of a whole life-style that
            he helped create...

RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30
FEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE
CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...

                         DUKE
            ... a generation of permanent
            cripples, failed seekers, who never
            understood the essential old-mystic
            fallacy of the Acid Culture: the
            desperate assumption that somebody...
            or at least some force -- is
            tending the light at the end of the
            tunnel.

HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX
SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON
SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT
LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.

                                                          108.


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE
DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out
of the back seat as he takes a bump.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was only one road back to L.A.
            US Interstate 15, just a flat-out
            high speed burn through Baker and
            Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the
            Hollywood Freeway straight into
            frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,
            just another freak in the Freak
            Kingdom.

DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING
facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon
sign that flashes beer.

                         DUKE
            Ahhh.  Wonderful.

DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.

INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY

DUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all
about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON
WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE
RAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD
MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden
bar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.

                         PROPRIETOR
            What'll you have?

DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.

                         DUKE
                   (doubtfully)
            Ballantine Ale...?

THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND
RELAXES.

                         DUKE
            Hard to find it served like this
            anymore.

As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE
AMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY
PIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack
reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.

                                                          109.


                         PROPRIETOR
            Where ya comin' from, young man?

                         DUKE
            Las Vegas.

                         PROPRIETOR
            A great town, that Vegas.  I bet
            you had good luck there.  You're
            the type.

                         DUKE
            I know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.

                         PROPRIETOR
                   (trustingly)
            That's a fine combination.  You
            can't lose.

A LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS
REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...
KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.

                         DUKE
                   (caught off guard... muttering)
            Oh, my God!...

                         PROPRIETOR
                   (not understanding)
            This is my granddaughter...

                         DUKE
                   (recovering)
            Don't worry...
                   (leans forward in confidence)
            ... and I'm actually the District
            Attorney from Ignoto County.
                   (winks)
            Just another good American like
            yourself.

A MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.

Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the
back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.

WHO FEELS ASHAMED.

DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.

EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY

A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.
Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...

                                                          110.


A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.

Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags
step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...

DUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the
trembling dash... DUKE catches it...

ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...

DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --
TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.

                         DUKE
            HOLY SHIT!!!

DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT
THE MARINES.

                         DUKE
            GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!

DUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS
IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE
CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY

DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!

DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            My heart was filled with joy.  I
            felt like a monster reincarnation
            of Horatio Alger... a man on the
            move... and just sick enough to be
            totally confident.

The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

                             END
FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS

                           by

              Terry Gilliam & Toy Grisoni




BLACK SCREEN

A desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind
comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters
singing "My Favorite Things." A series of sepia images of
anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after
another on the screen.

In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title
FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A
beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:

TITLE: "He who makes a beast of himself
       Gets rid of the pain
       Of being a man."
       Dr. Johnson

The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:

                         DUKE (V/O)
            We were somewhere around Barstow on
            the edge of the desert when the
            drugs began to take hold.

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black
screen.

EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred
miles an hour.  THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares.

AT THE WHEEL

STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,
BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.

BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND
WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY
UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.

The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths
up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I remember saying something like:
            "I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe
            you should drive..."

GONZO starts shaving.

                                                            2.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Suddenly there was a terrible roar
            all around us and the sky was full
            of what looked like huge bats, all
            swooping and screeching and diving
            around the car...

Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The
reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close
to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            ... and a voice was screaming: Holy
            Jesus!  What are these goddamn
            animals?

CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -

DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.
GONZO casually looks over...

                         GONZO
            What are you yelling about?

DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench
makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.

                         DUKE
            Never mind.  It's your turn to drive.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            No point mentioning these bats.  I
            thought.  The poor bastard will see
            them soon enough.

DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,
frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A
MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles
through the impressive stash.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            We had two bags of grass, seventy-
            five pellets of mescaline, five
            sheets of high powered blotter
            acid, a salt shaker half full of
            cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-
            colored uppers, downers, screamers,
            laughers... Also a quart of tequila,
            a quart of rum, a case of beer, a
            pint of raw ether and two dozen
            amyls.

                                                            3.


DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the
SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with
another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives
back into the car.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Not that we needed all that for the
            trip, but once you get locked into
            a serious drug collection, the
            tendency is to push it as far as
            you can.

THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,
weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A
BAT?

EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

IN THE RED SHARK

GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a
lousy driver.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The only thing that really worried
            me was the ether.  There is nothing
            in the world more helpless and
            irresponsible and depraved than a
            man in the depths of an ether binge.
            And I knew we'd get into that
            rotten stuff pretty soon.

The radio news wars with "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" on a tape
recorder.

                         RADIO NEWS
            An overdose of heroin was listed as
            the official cause of death for
            pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby
            whose body was found stuffed in a
            refrigerator last week...

GONZO changes the station - "ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET
JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE" vies with "SYMPATHY"... He
sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.
The RED SHARK fishtails.

                         GONZO
            "One toke over the line, sweet
            Jesus."

                                                            4.


                         DUKE
                   (muttering to himself)
            One toke.  You poor fool.  Wait
            till you see those goddamn bats.

UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD

A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a
thumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down
the road...

                         GONZO
            Let's give that boy a lift.

GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side
of the road.

                         DUKE
            We can't stop here - this is bat
            country!

GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The
HITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.

                         HITCHHIKER
            Hot damn!  I never rode in a
            convertible before!

Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the
sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-
NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.

                         DUKE
            Is that right?  Well, I guess
            you're about ready, eh?

The HITCHHIKER hesitates.

                         GONZO
            We're your friends.  We're not like
            the others.

                         DUKE
                   (hissing sharply)
            No more of that talk or I'll put
            the leeches on you.

DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.

EXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED
SHARK screams down the road.

                                                            5.


GONZO sings along to the tape player.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out
and taking his chances.

DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear
view mirror.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            How long could we maintain, I
            wondered.  How long before one of
            us starts raving and jabbering at
            this boy?  What will he think then?
            This same lonely desert was the
            last known home of the Manson family.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling
down GONZO's neck.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Would he make that grim connection
            when my attorney starts screaming
            about bats and huge manta rays
            coming down on the car?

DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with
the words, sometimes not.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            If so - well, we'll just have to
            cut his head off and bury him
            somewhere.  Because it goes without
            saying that we can't turn him loose.
            He'd report us at once to some kind
            of outback Nazi law enforcement
            agency, and they'll run us down
            like dogs...

                         DUKE
                   (out loud to himself)
            Jesus!  Did I say that?

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Or just think it?  Was I talking?
            Did they hear me?

                         GONZO
                   (reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)
            It's okay.  He's admiring the shape
            of your skull.

DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER
giggles nervously.

                                                            6.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Maybe I better have a chat with
            this boy I thought.  Perhaps if I
            explain things, he'll rest easy...

                         DUKE
                   (roaring over the
                   road noise)
            THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD
            PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --

The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.

                         DUKE
                   (yells)
            CAN YOU HEAR ME?

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs
into the back seat.

                         DUKE
            That's good.  Because I want you to
            have all the background.  This is a
            very ominous assignment -- with
            overtones of extreme personal
            danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!
            This is important, goddamnit!  This
            is a true story!...
                   (WHACKS the BACK OF
                   THE DRIVER'S SEAT
                   with his fist)


The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.

                         GONZO
                   (screams)
            Keep your hands off my fucking neck!

The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS
HIM BACK DOWN.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Our vibrations were getting nasty --
            but why?  Was there no communication
            in this car?  Had we deteriorated
            to the level of dumb beasts?

The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.

                                                            7.


                         DUKE
                   (to HITCHHIKER)
            I want you to understand that this
            man at the wheel is my attorney!
            He's not just some dingbat I found
            on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I
            think he's probably Samoan.  But it
            doesn't matter, does it?  Are you
            prejudiced?

                         HITCHHIKER
            Hell, no!

                         DUKE
            I didn't think so.  Because in
            spite of his race, this man is
            extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I
            forgot all about this beer.  You
            want one?
                   (HITCHHIKER shakes
                   his head)
            How about some ether?

                         HITCHHIKER
            What?

                         DUKE
            Never mind.  Let's get right to the
            heart of this thing.  Twenty-four
            hours ago we were sitting in the
            Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
            Hotel...

INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY

A uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE
through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They
are the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL
BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore
Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED
VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            ... in the patio section, of
            course, drinking Singapore Slings
            with mescal on the side, hiding
            from the brutish realities of this
            foul year of Our Lord, 1971.

The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and
shades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank
top undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious
conversation.

                                                            8.


                         DUKE
            I'm telling you, the Salazar story
            is getting too complicated.  The
            weasels have started closing in.

The DWARF sneers.

                         DWARF
            Perhaps this is the call you've
            been waiting for all this time,
            sir...

DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...

                         DUKE
            Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...

DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A
MOVIE SPY.

                         DWARF
            That was headquarters.  They want
            me to go to Las Vegas at once and
            make contact with a Portuguese
            photographer named Lacerda.  He'll
            have the details.  All I have to do
            is check into my sound proof suite
            and he'll seek me out.

GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!

                         GONZO
            God hell!  I think I see the
            pattern!  This one sounds like real
            trouble!  You're going to need
            plenty of legal advice before this
            thing is over.  As your attorney I
            must advise you that you'll need a
            very fast car with no top and after
            that, the cocaine.  And then the
            tape recorder, for special music,
            and some Acapulco shirts...
                   (GONZO tucks his
                   khaki undershirt into
                   his white
                   bellbottoms -- he
                   means business!)
            This blows my weekend, because
            naturally I'll have to go with
            you -- and we'll have to arm
            ourselves.

                                                            9.


                         DUKE
            Why not?  If a thing's worth doing,
            it's worth doing right.

DUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them
with the (very large) check in his hand.

They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it
swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.

                         DUKE
            I tell you, my man.  This is the
            American Dream in action!  We'd be
            fools not to ride this strange
            torpedo all the way to the end.

                         GONZO
            Indeed.  We must do it.  What kind
            of story is this?

EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO emerge.

                         DUKE
            The Mint 400!  The richest off-road
            race for motorcycles and dune-
            buggies in the history of organized
            sport!
                   (handing parking
                   ticket to Valet)
            -- a fantastic spectacle in honor
            of some fatback grossero who owns
            the luxurious Mint Hotel in the
            heart of downtown Vegas... at least
            that's what the press release says.

Their car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They
jump in.

                         DUKE
            We're going to have to drum it up
            on our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.

And they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-
bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY

The PINTO races through shot.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Getting hold of the drugs and
            shirts had been no problem...

                                                           10.


EXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back
window full of Hawaiian shirts.

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            ... but the car and tape recorder
            were not easy things to round up at
            6:30 on a Friday afternoon in
            Hollywood.

INT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

TORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile
as GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four
Singapore Slings.

                         GONZO
            O.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.
            We'll be there in thirty minutes.
                   (to DUKE -- hand over
                   the PHONE)
            I finally located a car with
            adequate horsepower and the proper
            coloring.
                   (into PHONE)
            What?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has
            a major credit card!  Do you
            realize who the fuck you're talking
            to?

                         DUKE
            Don't take any guff from these
            swine.
                   (GONZO slams the
                   phone down)
            Now we need a sound store with the
            finest equipment.  Nothing dinky.
            One of those new Belgian Heliowatts
            with a voice-activated shotgun
            mike, for picking up conversations
            in oncoming cars.

                         GONZO
            We won't make the nut unless we
            have unlimited credit.

                         DUKE
            We will.  You Samoans are all the
            same.  You have no faith in the
            essential decency of the white
            man's culture.

                                                           11.


EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK

The PINTO races down street.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The store was closed, but the
            salesman said he would wait, if we
            hurried...

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK

They're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE
BANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            But we were delayed en route when a
            Stingray in front of us killed a
            pedestrain.

Directly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered
corpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.

EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

                         DUKE (V/O)
            We had trouble, again, at the car
            rental agency.

Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with
satisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out
a clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.

                         AGENT
            Say... uh... you fellas are going
            to be careful with this car, aren't
            you?

                         DUKE
            Of course.

DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the
gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.

                         AGENT
            Well, good god!  You just backed
            over that two foot concrete abutment
            and you didn't even slow down!
            Forty-five in reverse!  And you
            barely missed the pump!

                         DUKE
            No harm done.  I always test the
            transmission that way.  The rear
            end.  For stress factors.

                                                           12.


GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box
of rum and ice into the RED SHARK.

                         AGENT
            Say.  Are you fellows drinking?

                         DUKE
            Not me.  We're responsible people.

He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The
AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.

                         GONZO
            There's another worrier.  He's
            probably all cranked up on speed.

EXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

STRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted
figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            We spent the rest of that night
            rounding up materials and packing
            the car.  Then we ate some mescaline
            and went swimming.

The surf crashes in the distance...

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself
float up through the silvery bubbles...

DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING
MOONLIT SURF.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Our trip was different.  It was to
            be a classic affirmation of
            everything right and true in the
            national character; a gross,
            physical salute to the fantastic
            possibilities of life in this
            country.  But only for those with
            true grit...

EXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

DUKE's intense face.

                         DUKE
            ...and we're chock full of that!

                                                           13.


                         GONZO
            Damn right!

                         DUKE
            My attorney understands this
            concept, despite his racial handicap.
            But do you?!

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            He said he understood, but I could
            see in his eyes that he didn't.  He
            was lying to me.

                         GONZO
            My heart!

GONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and
screeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
            Where's the medicine?

                         DUKE
            The medicine?  Yes, it's right here.

DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.

                         DUKE
            Don't worry, this man has a bad
            heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we
            have a cure for it.

DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO
falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The
HITCHHIKER looks petrified.

                         GONZO
                   (suddenly flailing
                   his naked arms at the sky)
            Turn up the fucking music!  My
            heart feels like an alligator!
            Volume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must
            have bass!  What's wrong with us?
            Are you goddamn old ladies?

                         DUKE
                   (turns up music to
                   full volume)
            You scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch
            your language!  You're talking to a
            Doctor of Journalism!

                                                           14.


                         GONZO
                   (laughing uncontrollably)
            What the fuck are we doing out here?
            Somebody call the police!  We need
            help!

                         DUKE
                   (to HITCHHIKER)
            Pay no attention to this swine.  He
            can't handle the medicine.
                   (he begins laughing)


                         GONZO
                   (to the HITCHHIKER)
            The truth is we're going to Vegas
            to croak a scag baron named Savage
            Henry.  I've known him for years
            but he ripped us off -- and you
            know what that means, right?

GONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
            Savage Henry has cashed his check!
            We're going to rip his lungs out!

                         DUKE
            And eat them!  That bastard won't
            get away with this!  What's going
            on in this country when a scum
            sucker like that can get away with
            sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?

GONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.

The HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,
AND FLEES.

                         HITCHHIKER
            Thanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.
            I like you guys.  Don't worry about
            me.

                         DUKE
                   (yells)
            Wait a minute!  Come back and have
            a beer!

The HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.

                                                           15.


                         GONZO
            Good riddance.  That boy made me
            nervous.  Did you see his eyes?
                   (laughing)
            Jesus, this is good medicine.

DUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.

                         DUKE
                   (suddenly clambering
                   into the front seat)
            Move over!!  We have to get out of
            California before that kid finds a
            cop!

DUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...

EXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead
driving.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It was absolutely imperative that
            we get to the Mint Hotel before the
            deadline for press registration.
            Otherwise, we might have to pay for
            our suite.

GONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off
and the powder swirls away on the wind.

                         GONZO
            Oh, Jesus!  Did you see what god
            just did to us?

                         DUKE
            God didn't do that!  You did it!
            You're a fucking narcotics agent,
            that was our cocaine, you pig!

                         GONZO
                   (waving his .357
                   Magnum at Duke)
            You better be careful.  Plenty of
            vultures out here.  They'll pick
            your bones clean before morning.

                         DUKE
            You whore!

GONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.

                                                           16.


                         GONZO
            Here -- chew this.  It's your half
            of the acid.

DUKE takes his half -- chews it.

                         DUKE
            How long do I have?

                         GONZO
            Maybe thirty more minutes.  As your
            attorney, I advise you to drive at
            top speed.  It'll be a goddamn
            miracle if we can get there before
            you turn into a wild animal.  Are
            you ready for that?  Checking into
            a Vegas hotel under a phony name
            with intent to commit capital fraud
            and a head full of acid.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Thirty minutes.  It was going to be
            very close.

The RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:
"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20
YEARS; SALE - LIFE!!"

EXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK

The RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner
spanning the street announces the MINT 400.

DUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a
buckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the
TICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.

                         DUKE
            I need this, right?

                         ATTENDANT
            I'll remember your face.

DUKE stares -- losing it...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There is no way of explaining the
            terror I felt.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP
ENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to
queue jump and failing.

                                                           17.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            I was pouring sweat.  My blood is
            too thick for Nevada.  I've never
            been able to properly explain
            myself in this climate.

A COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes
fixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            Be quiet, be calm... name, rank,
            and press affiliation, nothing
            else...

DUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the
tension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING
AROUND -- absolutely no success.

Something catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his
eyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET
WHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE
INEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            ...ignore this terrible drug,
            pretend it's not happening...

The LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE
comes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND
EXPLODES!

                         DUKE
            HI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL
            DUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S
            FOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL
            WISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT?
            I HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I
            REALIZE OF COURSE...

As DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH.
He tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.

                         DUKE
            ... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE
            LIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE.
            YES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND
            YOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S
            THE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?

DUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES.

                                                           18.


                         RESERVATIONS CLERK
                   (hands him an envelope)
            Your suite's not ready yet.  But
            there's somebody looking for you.

Her face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...

                         DUKE
                   (shouts)
            NO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
            YET!

The FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS.
DEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm
intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.

                         GONZO
            I can handle this.  This man has a
            bad heart, but I have plenty of
            medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.
            Prepare our suite at once.  We'll
            be in the bar.

GONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks
back -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green
jowls and fangs.

INT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY

The bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.
DUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the
wall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone...

                         GONZO
                   (to the bartender)
            Two Cuba Libres with beer and
            mescal on the side.
                   (opens the envelope)
            Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us
            in a room on the twelfth floor?

                         DUKE
            Lacerda?

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I couldn't remember.  The name rang
            a bell, but I couldn't concentrate.
            Terrible things were happening all
            around us...

DUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY
onto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.

                                                           19.


                         DUKE
            Order some golf shoes.  Otherwise,
            we'll never get out of this place
            alive.  It's impossible to walk in
            this muck -- no footing at all...

DUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.

DUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED
into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND
GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I was right in the middle of a
            fucking reptile zoo.  And somebody
            was giving booze to these goddamn
            things!  It won't be long before
            they tear us to shreds!

GONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.

                         GONZO
            If you think we're in trouble now
            wait until you see what's happening
            in the elevators.

GONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...
as he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to
keep him in his line of vision.

                         GONZO
            I just went upstairs to see this
            man Lacerda.  I told him I knew
            what he was up to...
                   (GONZO rallies --
                   turns fierce)
            He says he's a photographer!  But
            when I mentioned Savage Henry he
            freaked!  He knows we're onto him!

                         DUKE
            But what about our room?  And the
            golf shoes?

A GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at
them, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.

                         DUKE (CONT'D)
                   (grabbing GONZO
                   trying to hold him still)
            Holy shit!  Look at that bunch over
            there!  They've spotted us!

                                                           20.


Cut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing
next to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality.
GONZO is sitting in his original position.

                         GONZO
                   (downs his drink --
                   gets up)
            That's the press table.  Where you
            have to sign in for our credentials.
            Shit, let's get it over with.  You
            handle that, and I'll check on the
            room.

                         DUKE
            No, no.  Don't leave me!

Black screen.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK

A TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK,
protesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous
BELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on
the floor next to DUKE.

                         BELL BOY
            Four club sandwiches, four shrimp
            cocktails.

                         DUKE
            There's a big... machine in the
            sky... some kind of electric snake...

DUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon
sign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million
colored lights.

                         BELL BOY
            ... a quart of rum...

                         DUKE
            ... coming straight at us.

                         GONZO
            Shoot it.

                         DUKE
            Not yet.  I want to study its habits.

                         BELL BOY
            ... and nine fresh grapefruit.

                                                           21.


                         GONZO
            Vitamin C.  We'll need all we can
            get.

GONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into
DUKE.

                         GONZO
            Look, you've got to stop this talk
            about snakes and leeches and
            lizards and that stuff.  It's
            making me sick!

DUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS...

On TV: The LAOS INVASION -- A SERIES OF HORRIFYING
DISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE.

Newsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT
CALLEY court-martial.

                         DUKE
            What are you talking about?

                         GONZO
            You bastard!  They'll never let us
            back in that place.  I leave you
            alone for three minutes and you
            start waving that goddamn marlin
            spike around -- yelling about
            reptiles!  You scared the shit out
            of those people!  They were ready
            to call the cops.  Hell, the only
            reason they gave us press passes
            was to get you out of there...

A knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.

                         DUKE
            Oh my God!  Who's that?!

GONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to
LACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares
at a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep
suspicion.

                         LACERDA
            Duke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer.
            Got your press passes?  Good, good.
            Too bad you missed the bikes
            checking in.  My, what a sight!

DUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS.

                                                           22.


Looking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the
BOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers.

DUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised,
filthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him --
talking a foreign language.

                         LACERDA
            Husquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis.
            Maicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs.
            Couple of Triumphs, here and there
            a CZ.  All very fast.  What a race
            it's gonna be.

DUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK.  LACERDA is
now just a keen photographer.L

                         LACERDA
            Well, we start at dawn.  Get a good
            night's sleep.  I know I will.

And with a cheerful wave, he's gone.  DUKE is in shock.

                         DUKE
                   (weakly)
            That's good...

                         GONZO
            I think he's lying to us.  I could
            see it in his eyes.

                         DUKE
                   (even weaker)
            They'll probably have a big net for
            us when we show up.

DUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV...

                         GONZO
            Turn that shit off!

GONZO kills the TV.

Black screen.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Never lose sight of the primary
            responsibility.  Cover the story.
            But what was the story?  Nobody had
            bothered to say.

                                                           23.


EXT. DESERT - DAWN

Against A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE
SHOTGUNS into the dawn sky.  Clay pigeons shatter.  The Mint
Gun Club.

Next to them, MOTORCYCLES REV -- preparing for the MINT 400
RACE: A hundred BIKERS, MECHANICS and assorted MOTORSPORT
TYPES milling around in the pit area; taping headlights,
topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening.

DUKE wanders through.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The racers were ready at dawn.
            Very tense.  But the race didn't
            start until nine so we had three
            long hours to kill.

A sign by a long trestle table: "KOFFEE & DONUTS." DUKE
walks past -- ignoring the SMILING LADY behind the stall.

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            Those of us who had been up all
            night were in no mood for coffee
            and donuts.  We wanted strong drink.
            We were, after all, the Absolute
            Cream of the National Sporting
            Press and we were gathered here, in
            Las Vegas, for a very special
            assignment.  And when it comes to
            things like this you don't fool
            around.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

A real pit of iniquity.  Slot Machines.  Crap tables.  Smoke.
Drunken shouting.  The absolute cream of the NATIONAL
SPORTING PRESS.

DUKE is at the bar, engaged in drunken conversation with a
LIFE REPORTER...showing him his notebook.

                         DUKE
            See..."Kill the body and the head
            will die"... the Frazier/Ali fight...

                         MAGAZINE REPORTER
            A proper end to the 60's... Ali
            beaten by a human hamburger!

                         DUKE
            And both Kennedy's murdered by
            mutants.

                                                           24.


A SHOUT goes up from outside.  The sound of engines revving.

                         REPORTER
            That's it!  They're starting!

In a sudden rush the PRESS CROWD make for the door taking
DUKE with them.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV -- tension builds...

A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The MOTORCYCLES ROAR
AWAY.  A great cloud of dust goes up -- obscuring the RACERS
as they disappear into the desert...

A moment...

                         REPORTER
            Well, that's that.  They'll be back
            in an hour or so.  Let's go back to
            the bar.

The CROWD turns and streams back into the tent.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

DUKE heads for the bar along with the REST.  It's packed.
Drinks are ordered.

A shout from outside the tent goes up:

                         VOICE OFF
            Group 2!

The CROWD rushes for the door.  DUKE gets swept along.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV.  A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The
MOTORCYCLES ROAR AWAY.  Another great cloud of dust goes up...

The CROWD head back for the bar.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

The CROWD surge back to the bar.

                         VOICE OFF
            Group 3!

This time DUKE fights his way free of the CROWD.

                                                           25.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was something like 190 more
            bikes waiting to start.  They were
            due to go off 10 at a time every 2
            minutes.

DUKE hits the bar.

                         DUKE
            Beer!

A middle-aged HOODLUM in a T-shirt booms up to the bar.

                         HOODLUM
            God damn!  What day is this --
            Saturday?

                         DUKE
            More like Sunday.

                         HOODLUM
            Hah!  That's a bitch, ain't it?
            Last night I was home in Long Beach
            and somebody said they were runnin'
            the Mint 400 today, so I says to my
            old lady, "Man, I'm goin'." So she
            gives me a lot of crap about it, so
            I start slappin' her around, and
            the next thing you know two guys I
            never seen before are beating me
            stupid.

                         VOICE OFF
            Group 4!

Outside, another batch of motorcycles roar away -- kicking
up more clouds of dust.

                         HOODLUM
            Then they gave me ten bucks, put me
            on a bus, and when I woke up here I
            was in downtown Vegas, and for a
            minute all I could think was, "O
            Jesus, who's divorcing me this
            time?" But then I remembered, by
            God!  I was here for the Mint 400.
            And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful
            to be here.  Just wonderful to be
            here with you people.

A silence.  A MAGAZINE REPORTER lunges across the bar --
grabs the BARTENDER.

                                                           26.


                         MAGAZINE REPORTER
            Senzaman wassyneeds!

                         DUKE
                   (smacks the bar with
                   his palm)
            Hell yes!  Bring us ten!

            I'll back it!
                   (slides off his stool
                   to the floor)


Outside, motorcycles roar away.  The dust cloud billows into
the tent -- getting denser.

                         MAGAZINE REPORTER (CONT'D)
                   (on the floor)
            This is a magic moment in sport!
            It may never come again!  I once
            did the Triple Crown, but it was
            nothing like this.

A FROG-EYED WOMAN claws at the MAGAZINE REPORTER, tries to
haul him up.

                         FROG-EYED WOMAN
            Please stand up!  You're a
            correspondent for a major national
            magazine who's name we can't get
            clearance for!  Please!  You'd be a
            very handsome man if you'd just
            stand up!

                         MAGAZINE REPORTER
            Listen, madam.  I'm damn near
            intolerably handsome down here
            where I am.  You'd go crazy if I
            stood up!

A feverishly eager LACERDA appears out of the dust cloud, 3
cameras slung round his neck.

                         LACERDA
            Club soda, please.

                         FROG-EYED WOMAN
                   (to MAGAZINE REPORTER)
            Please!  I love Life!

                                                           27.


                         LACERDA
                   (to DUKE)
            Man, it's great out there!

                         DUKE
            Lunatics.

LACERDA grins.

                         VOICE OFF
            Group 6!

                         LACERDA
            Meet you outside!

LACERDA downs his drink -- hurries out through the crowd and
out into the cloud of dust.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Nothing.  Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST.

Barely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits.
The RIDER staggers off his bike.  The PIT CREW gas it up and
sends it back with a FRESH RIDER.

DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            By 10 they were spread out all over
            the course.  It was no longer a
            race, now it was an Endurance
            Contest.  The idea of trying to
            "cover this race" in any
            conventional press sense was absurd.

A HORN HONKS.  A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER.  LACERDA
hangs out of the window.

                         LACERDA
            It's great, isn't it?!  Jump in!

DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

IN THE BRONCO.

DUKE hangs on with his beer.  Nothing all around but the
HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.  LACERDA snaps madly away
at nothing at all!

                                                           28.


                         LACERDA
            I'll just keep trying different
            combos of film and lenses till I
            find one that works in this dust!

The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING...

We hear music and voices singing:

                         BATTLE HYMN
            "...As we go marching on
            When I reach my final campground,
            in
            that land beyond the sun,
            And the Great Commander asks me..."
            [What did he ask you, Rusty?]
            "Did you fight or did you run?"

A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust.  DUKE
coughs, chokes, drinks beer.

                         BATTLE HYMN
                   (continuing)
            [And what did you tell them,
            Rusty?]
            "We responded to their rifle fire
            with everything we had..."

The sound of gun shots...

A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE
RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL.  The radio blares:
"THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."

The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING
EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS.  A slant-eyed
Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and
stripes.  A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side.  They
yell over the roaring engines.

                         DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
            Where's the damn race?

                         DUKE
            Beats me.  We're just good patriotic
            Americans like yourself.

DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN.  In
response, the PASSENGER #2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his
grip on an automatic weapon.

                         DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
                   (suspiciously)
            What outfit you fellas with?

                                                           29.


                         DUKE
            The sporting press.  We're
            friendlies.  Hired geeks.

The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks.

                         DUKE
            If you want a good chase, you
            should get after that skunk from
            CBS News up ahead in the black jeep.
            He's the man responsible for that
            book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.

                         DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1
            HOT DAMN!

                         DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2
            A black jeep, you say?

And they ROAR away.

                         DUKE
            Take me back to the pits.

                         LACERDA
            No, no -- we have to go on.  We
            need total coverage.

DUKE gets out of the Bronco.

                         DUKE
            You're fired.

After a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver
roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It was time.  I felt, for an
            Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole
            scene.  The race was definitely
            under way.  I had witnessed the
            start; I was sure of that much.
            But what now?

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

MUSIC PUMPS OUT.  CRUISING IN THE RED SHARK IN VEGAS.  THE
SKY SWIRLS WITH MILLIONS OF NEON LIGHTS CHASING EACH OTHER
IN BAROQUE PATTERNS ACROSS GIGANTIC HOTEL SIGNS.  PSYCHEDELIC
LIGHT SHOWS TO LURE AND DERANGE THE INNOCENT.  CITY OF LOST
SOULS.

                                                           30.


                         DUKE
            Turn up the radio!  Turn up the
            tape machine!  Roll the windows
            down.  Let's taste this cool desert
            wind!  Aaah, yes!  This is what
            it's all about!

DUKE, beer in hand, drives -- a big smile for the world.
GONZO scans The Vegas Visitor.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Total control now.  Tooling along
            the main drag on a Saturday night
            in Vegas, two good old boys in a
            fire apple red convertible...
            stoned, ripped, twisted... Good
            people!

                         GONZO
            How about "Nickel Nick's Slot
            Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds
            heavy.  Twenty-nine cent hotdogs...

                         DUKE
            Look, what are we doing here?  Are
            we here to entertain ourselves, or
            to do the job?

                         GONZO
            To do the job, of course.  Here we
            go... a Crab Louie and quart of
            muscatel for twenty dollars!

The Shark hits a bump.

                         GONZO
            As your attorney I advise you to
            drive over to the Tropicana and
            pick up on Guy Lombardo.  He's in
            the Blue Room with his Royal
            Canadians.

They hit another bump.

                         DUKE
            Why?

                         GONZO
            Why what?

CUT to wide shot.  They are DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES in a
large casino parking lot, bumping over the dividers.

                                                           31.


                         DUKE
            Why should I pay out my hard-earned
            dollars to watch a fucking corpse.
            I don't know about you, but in my
            line of business it's important to
            be Hep.

EXT. DESERT ROOM HOTEL - NIGHT

TWO BIG SCREAMING FACES.

                         DOORMAN #1
            What the hell are you doing?!

                         DOORMAN #2
            You can't park here!

                         DUKE
            Why not?  Is this not a reasonable
            place to park?

Reveal the RED SHARK parked on the sidewalk in front of the
Desert Inn.  TWO DOORMEN loom over the car hood.  The
MARQUEE says: TONIGHT.  DEBBIE REYNOLDS.

GONZO leaps from the car, waving a five-dollar bill at the
DOORMAN.

                         GONZO
            We want this car parked!  We drove
            all the way from L.A. for this show.
            We're friends of Debbie's.

A pause, then... the DOORMAN pockets the bill, hands them a
parking stub.  DUKE and GONZO hurry into the hotel.

INT. DESERT FROM HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO walk through the lobby.  Black, mirrored,
sleek, classy.

                         DUKE
            Holy shit!  They almost had us
            there!  That was quick thinking.

                         GONZO
            What do you expect?  I'm your
            attorney.  You owe me five bucks.
            I want it now.

DUKE shrugs and hands over the $5.

                                                           32.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            This was Bob Hope's turf.  Frank
            Sinatra's.  Spiro Agnew's.  It
            seemed inappropriate to be haggling
            about nickel/dime bribes for the
            parking lot attendant.

A WINE-COLORED TUXEDO stops them at the entrance to the
ballroom.

                         WINE-COLORED TUXEDO
            Sorry, full house.

                         GONZO
            Goddamnit, we drove all the way
            from L.A.

                         WINE-COLORED TUXEDO
            I said there are no seats left...
            at any price.

                         GONZO
            Fuck seats!  We're old friends of
            Debbie's.  I used to romp with her.

GONZO and the WINE-COLORED TUXEDO get into an ugly arm-
waving negotiation.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            After a lot of bad noise, he let us
            in for nothing provided we would
            stand quietly at the back and not
            smoke.

As DUKE and GONZO disappear through the door we can hear the
orchestra blasting out a HIGHLY BLANDIZED "SGT. PEPPER'S
LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND."

A beat.

The door flies open and BOUNCERS manhandle DUKE and GONZO
out.  Despite the rough treatment they're both SCREECHING
WITH LAUGHTER.

                         GONZO
            Jesus creeping shit!

                         DUKE
                   (tears streaming)
            Did the mescaline just kick in?  Or
            was that Debbie Reynolds in a
            silver Afro wig?!

                         GONZO
                   (in hysteria)
            We wandered into a fucking time
            capsule!

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

DUKE DRIVES FAST into the night.  They're both LAUGHING
HYSTERICALLY.

                         DUKE
                   (in hysteria)
            We wandered into a fucking time
            capsule!

THEN... GONZO finds a TINY TEAR IN HIS JACKET...

                         GONZO
            What's this?...

GONZO is instantly MOROSE.

                         GONZO
            That scum...

GONZO twists round in the car -- SCREAMS back into the night.

                         GONZO
            SCUM!  I know where you live!  I'll
            find you and burn down your fucking
            house!

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS - NIGHT

A hundred foot high neon clown: BAZOOKO CIRCUS.

The RED SHARK pulls up beneath the sign.

                         DUKE
            This is the place.  They'll never
            fuck with us here.

                         GONZO
            Where's the ether?  This mescaline
            isn't working.

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

Into the GLARING, CHASING LIGHTS of the entrance canopy
steps DUKE in EC/U holding a KLEENEX SOAKED IN ETHER TO HIS
NOSE.

                                                           34.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Ah, devil ether.  It makes you
            behave like the village drunkard in
            some early Irish novel... total
            loss of all basic motor skills;
            blurred vision, no balance, numb
            tongue --
                   (throws away kleenex)
            The mind recoils in horror, unable
            to communicate with the spinal
            column.  Which is interesting,
            because you can actually watch
            yourself behaving in this terrible
            way, but you can't control it.

DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care-
taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            You approach the turnstiles and
            know that when you get there, you
            have to give the man two dollars or
            he won't let you inside... but when
            you get there, everything goes wrong.

THE ETHER KICKS IN:

DUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES,
GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING
CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Some angry Rotarian shoves you and
            you think: What's happening here?
            What's going on?  Then you hear
            yourself mumbling.

                         DUKE
                   (mumbling)
            Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of
            mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My
            name is Brinks; I was born... Born?

                         GONZO
            Get sheep over side... women and
            children to armored car... orders
            from Captain Zeep.

The ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES.

                                                           35.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Ether is the perfect drug for Las
            Vegas.  In this town they love a
            drunk.  Fresh meat.  So they put us
            through the turnstiles and turned
            us loose inside.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

Flames shoot up from below the casino.  Above, a HIGH WIRE
ACT with FOUR MUZZLED WOLVERINES, SIX NYMPHET SISTERS FROM
SAN DIEGO, TWO SILVER PAINTED POLACK BROTHERS, and THREE
KOREAN KITTENS.

The WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air.  TWO POLACKS
swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly
locked in a death battle.

All plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES
and SLOT MACHINES.  No one looks up.  The GAMBLERS REMAIN
INTENT ON THE SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL, THE TURN OF THE CARD,
THE ROLL OF A DICE.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Bazooko Circus is what the whole
            hep world would be doing Saturday
            night if the Nazis had won the war.
            This was the Sixth Reich.

Something causes DUKE to look down.  A dwarf carrying drinks
on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to
move out of the way.

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            A drug person can learn to cope
            with things like seeing their dead
            grandmother crawling up their leg
            with a knife in her teeth but,
            nobody should be asked to handle
            this trip.

GONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths.
One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume.  A
FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE.

                         FAIRGROUND BARKER
            Stand in front of this fantastic
            machine, my friend.  For just 99
            cents your likeness will appear 200
            hundred feet tall on a screen above
            downtown Las Vegas.

On a TV monitor a 200 FOOT HIGH DRUNKARD looms over the Las
Vegas skyline screaming OBSCENITIES.

                                                           36.


                         FAIRGROUND BARKER
            99 cents more for a voice message.
            Say whatever you want, fella.
            They'll hear you, don't worry about
            that.  Remember, you'll be 200 feet
            tall!

                         ANOTHER BARKER
            Step right up!  Shoot the pasties
            off the nipples of this ten-foot
            bull-dyke and win a cotton candy
            goat!

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO sit on the revolving platform.  GONZO
stares -- glassy eyed -- coming apart.

                         GONZO
            I hate to say this, but this place
            is getting to me.  I think I'm
            getting The Fear.

                         DUKE
            Nonsense.  We came here to find the
            American Dream, and now we're right
            in the vortex you want to quit.
            You must realize that we've found
            the Main Nerve.

                         GONZO
            That's what gives me The Fear.

                         DUKE
            Look over there.  Two women fucking
            a Polar Bear.

                         GONZO
            Please, don't tell me those things...
            Not now.
                   (signals the waitress
                   for two Wild Turkeys)
            This is my last drink.  How much
            money can you lend me?

                         DUKE
            Not much.  Why?

                         GONZO
            I have to go.

                         DUKE
            GO?

                                                           37.


                         GONZO
            Yes.  Leave the country.  Tonight.

                         DUKE
            Calm down.  You'll be straight in a
            few hours.

                         GONZO
            No.  This is serious.  One more
            hour in this town and I'll kill
            somebody!

                         DUKE
            OK.  I'll lend you some money.
            Let's go outside and see how much
            we have left.

                         GONZO
            Can we make it?

                         DUKE
            That depends on how many people we
            fuck with between here and the door.

                         GONZO
            I want to leave fast.

                         DUKE
            OK.  Lets pay this bill and get up
            very slowly.  It's going to be a
            long walk.
                   (signals waitress who
                   comes over)


                         GONZO
                   (suddenly to waitress)
            Do they pay you to screw that bear?

                         WAITRESS
            What?

                         DUKE
            He's just kidding.
                   (to GONZO)
            Come on, Doc -- lets go downstairs
            and gamble.

GONZO trembles with fear -- walks to the edge of the
turntable.

                         GONZO
            When does this thing stop?

                                                           38.


                         DUKE
            It won't stop.  It's not ever going
            to stop.

DUKE carefully steps off the turntable.

GONZO, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and
confusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away.

                         DUKE
            Don't move you'll come around.

DUKE reaches out to grab GONZO, who jumps back -- keeps
going around.

The BARTENDER narrows his eyes at them.

DUKE steps onto the merry-go-round -- hurries round the
bar -- approaching GONZO from the blind side and shoves
GONZO from behind.  GONZO goes down with a hellish scream.
DUKE approaches him with his hands in the air.  Smiling.

                         DUKE
            You fell.  Let's go.

GONZO refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched,
looking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps?

                         DUKE (CONT'D)
            OK.  You stay here and go to jail.
            I'm leaving.

DUKE walks fast towards the stairs.  GONZO catches up with
him.

                         GONZO
            Did you see that?  Some sonofabitch
            kicked me in the back.

                         DUKE
            Probably the bartender.  He wanted
            to stomp you for what you said to
            the waitress.

                         GONZO
            Good God!  Let's get out of here!
            Where's the elevator?

                         DUKE
                   (turning him in the
                   opposite direction)
            Don't go near that elevator.
            That's just what they want us to
            do... trap us in a steel box and
            take us down to the basement.

                                                           39.


EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO stumble out of the entrance.

                         DUKE
            Don't run.  They'd like any excuse
            to shoot us.

                         GONZO
                   (in an extended fall)
            You drive!  I think there's
            something wrong with me.

INT. MINT HOTEL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THEIR SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE AND GONZO RUN MADLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR... DUKE TAKING
CARE NOT TO STEP ON THE PATTERNED PART OF THE CARPET.

GONZO STRUGGLES with the key in the lock.

                         GONZO
            Those bastards have changed the
            lock on us.  They probably searched
            the room.  Jesus, we're finished!

The door SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN.  DUKE AND GONZO fall inside.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

                         GONZO
            Bolt everything!  Use all chains!

DUKE locks the door.  The suite is crowded with ROOM SERVICE
GOODIES.  DUKE turns to see GONZO staring at two hotel room
keys.  EVERYTHING STOPS.

                         GONZO
            Where did this one come from?

DUKE snatches a key.

                         DUKE
            That's Lacerda's room.

GONZO smiles a slow smile...

                         GONZO
            Yeah... I thought we might need it...

                         DUKE
            What for?

GONZO snatches the key back.

                                                           40.


                         GONZO
            Let's go up there and blast him out
            of bed with the fire hose.

                         DUKE
            No, we should leave the poor
            bastard alone.  I get the feeling
            that he's avoiding us for some
            reason.

                         GONZO
            Don't kid yourself.  That Portuguese
            son of a bitch is dangerous.  He's
            watching us like a hawk.

                         DUKE
            He told me he was turning in early...

GONZO utters an anguished cry -- slaps the wall with both
hands.

                         GONZO
            That dirty bastard!  I knew it!
            He's got hold of my woman!

                         DUKE
                   (laughing)
            That little blonde groupie with the
            film crew?  You think he sodomized
            her?

                         GONZO
            That's right, laugh about it!  You
            goddamn honkies are all the same!

GONZO SLASHES A GRAPEFRUIT with a HUGE RAZOR SHARP HUNTING
KNIFE.  DUKE blanches.

                         DUKE
            Where'd you get that knife?

GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- MANIACAL.

                         GONZO
            Room service sent it up.  I wanted
            something to cut the limes.

GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS!

                         DUKE
            What limes?

GONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS!

                                                           41.


                         GONZO
            They didn't have any.  They don't
            grow in the desert.

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!

                         GONZO
            That dirty toad bastard!  I knew I
            should have taken him out when I
            had the chance.  Now he has her.

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO SLASHES INSANELY!

DUKE watches -- straight-faced.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I remember the girl.  We'd had a
            problem with her in the elevator a
            few hours earlier: my attention had
            made a fool of himself.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

An elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF
LACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW.

DUKE and GONZO stagger in.

LACERDA drops his smile.  He's standing beside the BLONDE TV
REPORTER.  A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her.

                         BLONDE TV REPORTER
                   (to Gonzo)
            You must be a rider.  What class
            are you in?

                         GONZO
            Class?  What the fuck do you mean?

                         BLONDE TV REPORTER
            What do you ride?  We're filming
            the race for a TV series -- maybe
            we can use you.

                         GONZO
            Use me?

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Mother of God, I thought.  Here it
            comes.

GONZO is TREMBLING BADLY.  There's a moment of uncomfortable
silence.

                                                           42.


                         GONZO
                   (suddenly shouting)
            I ride the BIG ONES!  The really
            BIG fuckers!

GONZO shows his teeth to LACERDA.  DUKE laughs trying to
defuse the scene.

                         DUKE
            The Vincent Black Shadow.  We're
            with the Factory Team.

                         TV CAMERAMAN
            Bullshit.

GONZO stills -- becomes dangerous -- zeros in on the TV
CAMERAMAN -- groin to groin...

                         GONZO
            Wait a minute, pardon me lady, but
            I think there's some kind of
            ignorant chicken-sucker in this car
            who needs his face cut open.  You
            cheap honky faggots!  Which one of
            you wants to get cut?!

DEAD SILENCE.

Ding!  The elevator door opens, but nobody moves.  The door
closes.

Next floor.  Ding!  The door opens again.  A middle-aged
couple start to get in.  Change their minds.  The door closes.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

DUKE and GONZO run down the corridor.  GONZO LAUGHS WILDLY.

                         GONZO
            Spooked!  They were spooked!  Like
            rats in a death cage!

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO CRASH into their hotel suite -- BOLT THE DOOR.
GONZO stops laughing.

                         GONZO
            Goddamn.  It's serious now.  That
            girl understood.  She fell in love
            with me.

END FLASHBACK.

                                                           43.


INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO with the BIG HUNTING KNIFE --
sliced grapefruit segments everywhere.

                         GONZO
            Let's go up there and castrate that
            fucker!

GONZO pauses -- A MAD THOUGHT -- turns to DUKE.

                         GONZO
                   (squinting suspiciously)
            Have you made a deal with him?  Did
            you put him on to her?

                         DUKE
                   (backing slowly
                   towards the door)
            Look you better put that blade away
            and get your head straight.  I have
            to put the car in the lot.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            One of the things you learn, after
            years of dealing with drug people,
            is that you can turn your back on a
            person, but never turn your back on
            a drug.  Especially when it's
            waving a razor-sharp hunting knife
            in your eyes.

INT. CASINO/LOBBY MINT HOTEL

The MAGAZINE REPORTER is on the telephone.

                         MAGAZINE REPORTER
            Las Vegas at dawn.  The racers are
            still asleep, the dust is still on
            the desert, fifty thousand dollars
            in prize money, slumbers darkly in
            the office safe at Del Webb's
            fabulous Mint Hotel...

DUKE walks past the REPORTER -- into THE CASINO, THE SAD,
MEAGRE CROWDS AROUND THE CRAP TABLES.  No joy.  DUKE watches.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Who are these people?  These faces!
            Where do they come from?  They look
            like caricatures of used car
            dealers from Dallas.

                                                           44.


                         DUKE (V/O; CONT'D)
            And, sweet Jesus, there are a hell
            of a lot of them at four-thirty on
            a Monday morning.  Still humping
            the American dream, that vision of
            the big winner somehow emerging
            from the last minute predawn chaos
            of a stale Vegas casino.

DUKE stops at the Money Wheel, puts down a two dollar bill
on a number, the wheel turns, he loses.

                         DUKE
            You bastards!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            No.  Calm down.  Learn to ENJOY
            losing.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE walks back into the room.  We hear the LOUD STRAINS OF
THREE DOG NIGHT'S "JOY TO THE WORLD."

He walks to the bathroom and opens the door.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.
Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A
large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The
shower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER
PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over
the sink.

DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED
UP WHITE BLOTTER.

                         DUKE
            You ate ALL THIS ACID?

No answer.

                         DUKE
                   (turning down the volume)
            You evil son of a bitch.  You
            better hope there's some Thorazine
            in that bag, because if there's
            not, you're in bad trouble.

                         GONZO
            Music!  Turn it up.  Put that tape
            on.

                                                           45.


                         DUKE
            What tape?

                         GONZO
            Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit."
            I want a rising sound.

                         DUKE
            You're doomed.  I'm leaving here in
            two hours and then they're going to
            come up here and beat the mortal
            shit out of you with big saps.
            Right there in that tub.

                         GONZO
            I dig my own graves.  Green water
            and the White Rabbit.  Put it on.

                         DUKE
            OK.  But do me one last favor, will
            you.  Can you give me two hours?
            That's all I ask -- just two hours
            to sleep before tomorrow.  I
            suspect it's going to be a very
            difficult day.

He switches on the tape. "WHITE RABBIT" begins to build.

                         GONZO
                   (coolly)
            Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll
            give you all the time you need, at
            my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but
            you'll be wanting a cushion, so,
            why don't you just lay one of those
            $100 bills down there beside the
            radio, and fuck off?

                         DUKE
            How about a check?

                         GONZO
            Whatever's right.

DUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and
leaves, closing the door behind him.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted.
Suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.

                         GONZO (V/O)
            Help!  You bastard!  I need help!

                                                           46.


DUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.

                         DUKE
            Shit, he's killing himself!

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

DUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio
with the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its
mounts.

                         GONZO
                   (snarling)
            I want that fucking radio!

DUKE GRABS THE RADIO.

                         DUKE
            Don't touch it!  Get back in that
            tub!

                         GONZO
            Back the tape up.  I need it again!
            Let it roll!  Just as high as the
            fucker can go!  And when it comes
            to that fantastic note where the
            rabbit bites its own head off, I
            want you to THROW THAT FUCKING
            RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!

DUKE stares down at GONZO.

                         DUKE
            Not me.  It would blast you through
            the wall -- stone dead in ten
            seconds and they'd make me explain
            it!

                         GONZO
            BULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.

HIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.

                         DUKE
            Jesus.

                         GONZO
            Do it!  I want to get HIGHER!

DUKE considers this.  He's had enough.

                                                           47.


                         DUKE
            Okay.  You're right.  This is
            probably the only solution.
                   (holds the PLUGGED IN
                   TAPE/RADIO over the tub)
            Let me make sure I have it all
            lined up.  You want me to throw
            this thing into the tub when "WHITE
            RABBIT" peaks.  Is that it?

GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.

                         GONZO
            Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think
            I was going to have to go out and
            get one of the goddamn maids to do
            it.

                         DUKE
            Are you ready?

He switches "WHITE RABBIT" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS
AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.

Meanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a
good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when "WHITE
RABBIT" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.

GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A
TIDAL WAVE.

DUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF
THE BATHROOM.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE slumps onto the sofa.

SILENCE.

GONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE
WAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at
DUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.

                         DUKE
            MACE!  YOU WANT THIS?

GONZO stops -- hisses.

                         GONZO
            You bastard!  You'd do that,
            wouldn't you?

                                                           48.


                         DUKE
                   (laughs)
            Why worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing
            in the world like a Mace high.
            Forty-five minutes on your knees
            with the dry heaves...

                         GONZO
            You cheap honky sonofabitch...

                         DUKE
            Why not?  Hell, just a minute ago,
            you were asking me to kill you!
            And now you want to kill me!  What
            I should do, goddamnit, is call the
            police!

                         GONZO
            The cops?

                         DUKE
            There's no choice.  I wouldn't dare
            go to sleep with you wandering
            around with a head full of acid and
            wanting to slice me up with that
            goddamn knife!

                         GONZO
                   (mumbles)
            Who said anything about slicing you
            up?  I just wanted to carve a
            little Z on your forehead.  Nothing
            serious.

GONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.

                         DUKE
                   (menaces him with the MACE)
            Get back in that tub.  Eat some
            reds and try to calm down.  Smoke
            some grass, shoot some smack --
            shit, do whatever you have to do,
            but let me get some rest.

GONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.

                         GONZO
            Hell, yes.  You really need some
            sleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.
            What a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't
            let me keep you up.

                                                           49.


GONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair
up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next
to the clock.

DUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He
collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom.
            Just another ugly refugee from the
            Love Generation.

The WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his
face.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL
BEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            My attorney had never been able to
            accept the notion -- often espoused
            by former drug abusers -- that you
            can get a lot higher without drugs
            than with them.  And neither have
            I, for that matter.

The pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL
LIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the
foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior
of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.

INT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT

A slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the
action is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I recall one night in the Matrix.
            There I was -- a victim of the Drug
            Explosion.  A natural street freak,
            just eating whatever came by.

A ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The
sound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.

                         ROAD-PERSON
            Anybody want some L...S...D...?  I
            got all the makin's right here.
            All I need is a place to cook.

The camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.

INT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Still in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a
HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.

                                                           50.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            I decided to eat only half at first.
            Good thinking.  But I spilled the
            rest on the sleeve of my red
            Pendleton shirt.

DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the
door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in
slow-motion.

                         MUSICIAN
            What's the trouble?

                         DUKE
                   (also in slow-motion)
            Well, all this white stuff on my
            sleeve is LSD.

The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A
long pause.

Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-
cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.
We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the
men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...
sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The
STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            With a bit of luck his life was
            ruined -- forever thinking that
            just behind some narrow door in all
            his favorite bars, men in red
            Pendleton shirts are getting
            incredible kicks from things he'll
            never know.

INT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT

The STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking
lost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a
TV white noise snowstorm.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE sits staring at the TV.

                                                           51.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Strange memories on this nervous
            night in Las Vegas.
                   (he gets up, pours
                   himself a drink)
            Has it been five years?  Six?  It
            seems like a lifetime -- the kind
            of peak that never comes again.
            San Francisco in the middle sixties
            was a very special time and place
            to be a part of.  But no
            explanation, no mix of words or
            music or memories can touch that
            sense of knowing that you were
            there and alive in that corner of
            time and the world.  Whatever it
            meant.

DUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.

EXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE

We are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,
            AT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE
            SPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A
            FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT
            WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,
            THAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I
            THINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE
            OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE
            FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY
            MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T
            NEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY
            prevail.  We had all the momentum;
            we were riding the crest of a high
            and beautiful wave...

DUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            So now, less than five years later,
            you can go up on a steep hill in
            Las Vegas and look west, and with
            the right kind of eyes you can
            almost see the high water mark --
            that place where the wave finally
            broke and rolled back.

                                                           52.


The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.
Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi
shouting "WOODSTOCK ÜBER ALLES!"

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN

A harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking
like shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The decision to flee came suddenly.
            Or maybe not.

DUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of
fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.

                         BELL BOY
            Room service!

The BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already
stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Maybe I'd planned it all along --
            subconsciously waiting for the
            right moment.  The bill was a
            factor, I think.  Because I had no
            money to pay for it.

DUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Our room service tabs had been
            running somewhere between $29 and
            $36 per hour, for forty-eight
            consecutive hours.  Incredible.
            How could it happen?

DUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED
LUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --
empty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            But by the time I asked this
            question, there was no one around
            to answer.

DUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.

                                                           53.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            My attorney was gone.  He must have
            sensed trouble.

                                            QUICK CUT TO:

EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY

GONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of
brand-new fine cowhide luggage.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Panic.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --
leaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both
ways, then hurries away down the corridor.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It crept up my spine like first
            rising vibes of an acid frenzy.
            All these horrible realities began
            to dawn on me.

INT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY

An anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the
elevator descends.  He searches his pockets...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Here I was, alone in Las Vegas,
            with this goddamned incredibly
            expensive car, completely twisted
            on drugs, no cash, no story for the
            magazine.  And on top of everything
            else I had a gigantic goddamn hotel
            bill to deal with.

DUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.

The door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN
HANDCUFFS.

DUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors
close.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I didn't even know who had won the
            race.  Maybe nobody.

                                                           54.


INT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering
MANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.

                         DUKE
                   (muttering to himself)
            How would Horatio Alger have
            handled this situation?

EXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY

Motoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN
with a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves
at the CAR BOY.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Stay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a
            relatively respectable citizen -- a
            multiple felon, perhaps, but
            certainly not dangerous.

The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The
back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint
400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            Luckily, I had taken the soap and
            grapefruit and other luggage out to
            the car a few hours earlier.  Now
            it was only a matter of slipping
            the noose...

DUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!

                         CLERK'S VOICE
            MR. DUKE!

DUKE freezes.

                         CLERK'S VOICE
            Mr. Duke!  We've been looking for
            you!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The game was up!  They had me.

                         DUKE
                   (to himself)
            Well, why not?  Many fine books
            have been written in prison.

                                                           55.


Resigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK
arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS
HAND.

                         CLERK
            Sir?
                   (thrusts out a TELEGRAM)
            This telegram came for you.
            Actually, it isn't for you.  It's
            for somebody named Thompson, but it
            says 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does
            that make sense?

                         DUKE
                   (barely able to speak)
            Yes... It makes sense.

DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.

The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous
stash inside.

                         CLERK
            I checked the register for this man
            Thompson.  We don't show him but I
            figured he might be part of your
            team.

                         DUKE
            He is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to
            him.

He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.

SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word
or two.

                         CLERK
            What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's
            signature on the telegram from Los
            Angeles.  When we knew he was right
            here in the hotel.

                         DUKE
            You did the right thing.  Never try
            to understand a press message.
            About half the time we use codes --
            especially with Dr. Gonzo.

                         CLERK
            Tell me.  When will the doctor be
            awake?

                                                           56.


                         DUKE
                   (tenses)
            Awake?  What do you mean?

DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.

                         CLERK
                   (uncomfortably)
            Well... the manager, Mr. Heem,
            would like to meet him.  Nothing
            unusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet
            all our large accounts... put them
            on a personal basis... just a chat
            and a handshake, you understand.

                         DUKE
            Of course.  But if I were you, I'd
            leave the Doctor alone until after
            he's eaten breakfast.  He's a very
            crude man.

DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.

                         CLERK
            But he will be available?  Perhaps
            later this morning?

                         DUKE
            Look.  That telegram was all
            scrambled.  It was actually from
            Thompson, not to him.  Western
            Union must have gotten the names
            reversed.  I have to get going.  I
            have to get out to the track.

                         CLERK
            There's no hurry!  The race is over!

                         DUKE
                   (taking off)
            Not for me.

He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.

                         CLERK
            Let's have lunch!

                         DUKE
            Righto!

EXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY

DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.

                                                           57.


A "YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS" sign flashes past.

Bob Dylan plays: "Memphis Blues Again -- "Aaww, Mama, can
this really by the end...?"

A sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Jesus, bad waves of paranoia,
            madness, fear and loathing --
            intolerable vibrations in this
            place.  Get out!  The weasels were
            closing in.  I could smell the ugly
            brutes.  Flee!

DUKE drives fast.

                         DUKE
            Do me one last favor Lord: just
            give me five more high-speed hours
            before you bring the hammer down;
            just let me get rid of this goddamn
            car and off of this horrible desert.

A sign flashes "YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE."

A patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.

                         DUKE (CONT'D)
            You evil bastard!  This is your
            work!  You'd better take care of
            me, Lord... because if you don't
            you're going to have me on your
            hands.

The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Few people understand the psychology
            of dealing with a Highway Traffic
            Cop.  Your normal speeder will
            panic and immediately pull over to
            the side.  This is wrong.

DUKE floors the gas pedal.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

THE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.

                                                           58.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            Make the bastard chase you.  He
            will follow.  But he won't know
            what to make of your blinker signal
            that says you're about to turn right.

DUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            This is to let him know you're
            looking for a proper place to pull
            off and talk.

AN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.

DUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It will take him a moment to
            realize that he is about to make
            180 degree turn at speed... but you
            will be ready for it, braced for
            the G's and the fast heel toe work.

The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.

EXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY

The patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE
stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Just what the FUCK did you think
            you were doing?!

DUKE smiles.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            May I see your license.

                         DUKE
            Of course, officer.

DUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer
can -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I knew I was fucked.

The COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for
DUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.

                                                           59.


                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Could I have that, please?

                         DUKE
            Why not?  It was getting warm anyway.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --
glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars
of soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            You realize...

                         DUKE
            Yeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I
            understand that.  I knew it was a
            crime but I did it anyway.  Shit,
            why argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            That's a strange attitude.

He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            You know -- I get the feeling you
            could use a nap.  There's a rest
            area up ahead.  Why don't you pull
            over and sleep a few hours?

                         DUKE
            A nap won't help.  I've been awake
            for too long -- three or four
            nights.  I can't even remember.  If
            I go to sleep now, I'm dead for
            twenty hours.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes
            into my book, as of noon, is that I
            apprehended you... for driving too
            fast, and advised you to proceed no
            further than the next rest area...
            your stated destination, right?
            Where you plan to take a long nap.
            Do I make myself clear?

                         DUKE
            How far is Baker?  I was hoping to
            stop there for lunch.

                                                           60.


                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Not my jurisdiction.  The city
            limits are two point two miles
            beyond the rest area.  Can you make
            it that far?

                         DUKE
            I'll try.  I've been wanting to go
            to Baker for a long time.  I've
            heard a lot about it.

The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.

                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
            Excellent seafood.  With a mind
            like yours, you'll probably want to
            try the land-crab.  Try the Majestic
            Diner.

The PATROLMAN slams the door shut.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

DUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I felt raped.  The Pig had done me
            on all fronts, and now he was going
            off to chuckle about it -- on the
            west side of town, waiting for me
            to make a run for L.A.

DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he
signals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn
he sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn
their eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER
drops his thumb.

                         DUKE
            Great Jesus, it's him.

DUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE
WAY HE CAME.

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.

                         DUKE
            They've nailed me!  I'm trapped in
            some stinking desert crossroads
            called Baker.  I don't have much
            time.  The fuckers are closing in.
            They'll hunt me down like a beast!

                                                           61.


INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

GONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican
Day of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons.

                         GONZO
            Who?  You sound a little paranoid.

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE screams -- sweat pouring.

                         DUKE
            You bastard!  I need a lawyer
            immediately!

INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

                         GONZO
            What are you doing in Baker?
            Didn't you get my telegram?

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

                         DUKE
            What?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in
            trouble.  You worthless bastard.
            I'll cripple your ass for this!
            All that shit in the car is yours!
            You understand that?  When I finish
            testifying out here you'll be
            disbarred!

INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

                         GONZO
            You're supposed to be in Vegas.  We
            have a suite at the Flamingo.  I
            was just about to leave for the
            airport.

INT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.

                         GONZO'S VOICE
            You brainless scumbag!  You're
            supposed to be covering the National
            District Attorney's conference!  I
            made all the reservations... rented
            a white Cadillac convertible... the
            whole thing is arranged!  What the
            hell are you doing out there in the
            middle of the fucking desert?

                                                           62.


DUKE stares at the telegram.

                         DUKE
            Never mind.  It's all a big joke.
            I'm actually sitting beside the
            pool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking
            from a portable phone.  Some dwarf
            brought it out from the casino.  I
            have total credit!  Can you grasp
            that?
                   (shouts)
            Don't come anywhere near this place!
            Foreigners aren't welcome here!

DUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

C/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Well.  This is how the world works.

C/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            All energy flows according to the
            whims of the Great Magnet.

C/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert
dirt.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            What a fool I was to defy Him.

The IGUANA sits unfazed.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Never cross the Great Magnet.  I
            understood this now...
                   (another blast from
                   the gun)
            ... and with understanding came a
            sense of almost terminal relief.

DUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the
thuds of the explosions echo away.

EXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY

The RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.

                                                           63.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            I had to get rid of The Shark.  Too
            many people might recognize it...
            ...especially the Vegas Police.
                   (tight C/U of DUKE)
            Luckily, my credit card was still
            technically valid.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

DUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE
WHITE WHALE.

DUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            This was a superior machine -- ten
            grand worth of gimmicks and high
            price special effects.  The rear
            windows leapt up with a touch like
            frogs in a dynamited pond.  The
            dashboard was full of esoteric
            lights and dials and meters that I
            would never understand.

EXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON

A GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S
CONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            If the Pigs were gathering in
            Vegas, I felt the Drug Culture
            should be represented as well...
            and there was a certain bent appeal
            in the notion of running a savage
            burn on one Las Vegas hotel and
            then just wheeling across town and
            checking into another.

The WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately
attended by impressed MINIONS.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Me and a thousand ranking cops from
            all over America.  Why not?  Move
            confidently into their midst.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco
shirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden
behind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.

                                                           64.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            My arrival was badly timed.

THE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all
dressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,
Arnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.

Ahead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.
The POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,
weeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.

                         POLICE CHIEF
            What do you mean I'm too late to
            register?  I'm a police chief.
            From Michigan.  Look, fella, I told
            you.
                   (waves a POSTCARD)
            I have a postcard here that says I
            have reservations in this hotel.

                         CLERK
                   (prissily)
            I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the
            "late list." Your reservations were
            transferred to the... ah...
            Moonlight Motel, which is out on
            Paradise Boulevard...

                         POLICE CHIEF
            I've already paid for my goddamn
            room!

                         CLERK
            It's actually a very fine place of
            lodging and only sixteen blocks
            from here, with its own pool and...

                         POLICE CHIEF
            You dirty little faggot!  Call the
            manager!  I'm tired of listening to
            this dogshit!

FRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.

                         CLERK
                   (solicitously)
            I'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you
            a cab?

The POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Of course, I could hear what the
            Clerk was really saying...

                                                           65.


                         CLERK
                   (IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)
            Listen, you fuzzy little shithead --
            I've been fucked around, in my
            time, by a fairly good cross-
            section of mean-tempered rule-crazy
            cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck
            you, officer, I'm in charge here,
            and I'm telling you we don't have
            room for you."

DUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.

                         DUKE
            Say.  I hate to interrupt, but I
            wonder if maybe I could just sort
            of slide through and get out of
            your way.  Name's Raoul Duke --
            Raoul Duke.  My attorney made the
            reservation.

DUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE
goes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he
was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The
CLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.

                         CLERK
            Certainly, Mr. Duke!

                         DUKE
            My bags are out there in that white
            Cadillac convertible.  Can you have
            someone drive it around to the room?

ALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.

                         DUKE
            Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild
            Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and
            a night's worth of ice delivered to
            my room, please?

                         CLERK
            Don't worry about a thing, sir.
            Just enjoy your stay.

                         DUKE
            Well, thank you.

DUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the
elevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of
beer and toasts them.  The doors close.

                                                           66.


INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY

DUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.

                         DUKE
            Ah, home at last!

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.

A 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.

GONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a
drug-addled grin on his face.

                         DUKE
            You degenerate pig!

                         GONZO
            It can't be helped.  This is Lucy.
                   (laughing distractedly)
            You know--like "Lucy In The Sky
            With Diamonds."

LUCY eyes DUKE venomously.

                         GONZO
            Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!
            Remember what happened at the
            airport!  No more of that, okay?

LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his
arm round her shoulder.

                         GONZO
            Lucy... this is my client.  This is
            Mr. Duke, the famous journalist.
            He's paying for this suite, Lucy.
            He's on our side.

DUKE flops onto the sofa.

                         GONZO
            Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves
            artists.

DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of
artwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in
charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.

                         GONZO
            Lucy paints portraits of Barbra
            Streisand.

                                                           67.


                         LUCY
            I drew these from TV.

                         GONZO
            Fantastic.  She came all the way
            down here from Montana just to give
            these portraits to Barbra.  We're
            going over to the Americana Hotel
            tonight to meet her backstage...

DUKE's voice rises above GONZO.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I desperately needed peace, rest,
            sanctuary.  I hadn't counted on
            this.  Finding my attorney on acid
            and locked into some kind of
            preternatural courtship.

                         DUKE
            Well, I guess they brought the car
            round by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF
            OUT OF THE TRUNK.

DUKE fixes GONZO hard.

                         GONZO
            Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.
                   (to LUCY)
            Now, we'll be right back.  Don't
            answer the phone if it rings.

                         LUCY
                   (makes one-fingered
                   Jesus freak sign)
            God bless.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY

DUKE collars GONZO -- serious.

                         DUKE
            WELL?  What are your plans?

                         GONZO
            Plans?

                         DUKE
            Lucy.

                                                           68.


                         GONZO
                   (struggling to focus)
            Shit.  I met her on the plane and I
            had all that acid.
                   (he shrugs)
            You know, those little blue barrels.
            I gave her a cap before I realized...
            she's a religious freak... Jesus,
            she's never even had a drink.

                         DUKE
            Well... It'll probably work out.
            We can keep her loaded and peddle
            her ass at the drug convention.

GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.

                         GONZO
            Listen, she's running away from
            home for something like the fifth
            time in six months.  It's terrible.

                         DUKE
            She's perfect for this gig.  These
            cops will go fifty bucks a head to
            beat her into submission and then
            gang fuck her.  We can set her up
            in one of these back street motels,
            hang pictures of Jesus all over the
            room, then turn these pigs loose on
            her... Hell she's strong; she'll
            hold her own.

GONZO's face twitches badly.

                         GONZO
            Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick
            but I never expected to hear you
            actually say that kind of stuff.

                         DUKE
            It's straight economics.  This girl
            is a god-send.  Shit, she can make
            us a grand a day.

                         GONZO
            NO!  Stop talking like that.

                         DUKE
            I figure she can do about four at a
            time.  Christ, if we keep her full
            of acid that's more like two grand
            a day.  Maybe three.

                                                           69.


                         GONZO
            You filthy bastard.  I should cave
            your fucking head in.

                         DUKE
            In a few hours, she'll probably be
            sane enough to work herself into a
            towering Jesus-based rage at the
            hazy recollection of being seduced
            by some kind of cruel Samoan who
            fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her
            to a Vegas hotel room and savagely
            penetrated every orifice in her
            body with his throbbing,
            uncircumcised member.

GONZO starts crying.

                         GONZO
            NO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I
            wanted to help her!

                         DUKE
            You'll go straight to the gas
            chamber.  And even if you manage to
            beat that, they'll send you back to
            Nevada for Rape and Consensual
            Sodomy.  She's got to go.

Pause.

                         GONZO
            Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help
            somebody these days.

A silence.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The only alternative was to take
            her out to the desert and feed her
            remains to the lizards.  But, it
            seemed a bit heavy for the thing we
            were trying to protect: My attorney.

                         GONZO
            We have to cut her loose.  She's
            got two hundred dollars.  And we
            can always call the cops up there
            in Montana, where she lives, and
            turn her in.

                         DUKE
            What?... What kind of goddamn
            monster are you?

                                                           70.


                         GONZO
            It just occurred to me, that she
            has no witnesses.  Anything that
            she says about us is completely
            worthless.

                         DUKE
            Us?

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET

DUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.

                         DUKE
            Hotel Americana?  I need a
            reservation.  For my niece.  Listen,
            I need her treated very gently.
            She's an artist, and might seem a
            trifle highstrung...

In the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the
door.

                         GONZO
            Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet
            Barbra...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I felt like a Nazi, but it had to
            be done.

EXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK

The WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps
LUCY and her paintings from the car.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Lucy was a potentially fatal
            millstone on both our necks.  There
            was absolutely no choice but to cut
            her adrift and hope her memory was
            fucked.

GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --
waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting
to come down...

GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands
together as if washing his hands of the situation.

                         GONZO
            Well that's that.  Take off slowly.
            Don't attract attention.

                                                           71.


They pull out into traffic.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK

                         GONZO
            I gave the cabbie an extra ten
            bucks to make sure she gets there
            safe.  Also, I told him I'd be
            there myself in an hour, and if she
            wasn't, I'd come back out here and
            rip his lungs out.

                         DUKE
            That's good.  You can't be subtle
            in this town.

                         GONZO
            As your attorney, I advise you to
            tell me where you put the goddamn
            mescaline.

                         DUKE
            Maybe we should take it easy tonight.

                         GONZO
            Right.  Let's find a good seafood
            restaurant and eat some red salmon.
            I feel a powerful lust for red
            salmon...

The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The
sun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson
tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

GONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.

In the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.

                         DUKE
            Come on, we're going to be late.

GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth
with a towel.

                         GONZO
            This goddamn mescaline.  Why the
            fuck can't they make it a little
            less pure?  Maybe mix it up with
            Rolaids or something.

                                                           72.


INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

                         EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
                   (crackling and
                   booming over the
                   lousy sound system)
            On behalf of the prosecuting
            attorneys of this county, I welcome
            you to the Third National DA's
            Conference on Narcotics and
            Dangerous Drugs.

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman
type -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:
NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. "If You Don't Know, Come To
Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach."

A BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS
AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod
dress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be
WITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around
20 REDNECKS.

A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles
distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.

At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI
wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name
tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.

GONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,
CRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.

                         GONZO
                   (lowers his voice)
            I saw these bastards in Easy Rider,
            but I didn't believe they were real.
            Not like this.  Not hundreds of them!

                         DUKE
            They're actually nice people when
            you get to know them.

                         GONZO
            Man, I know these people in my
            goddamn blood!

                         DUKE
            Don't mention that word around here.
            You'll get them excited.

                         GONZO
            This is a fucking nightmare.

                                                           73.


                         DUKE
            Right.  Sure as hell some dope-
            dealing bomb freak is going to
            recognize you and put the word out
            that you're partying with a thousand
            cops.

                         COP IN BACK
            SSSSHHH!

DR. BLUMQUIST -- a "drug expert" -- takes the stage.

                         DR. BLUMQUIST
            We must come to terms with the Drug
            Culture in the country... country...
            country...

The sound systems echoes.

                         DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
            The reefer butt is called a "roach,"
            because it resembles a cockroach...
            cockroach... cockroach...

                         GONZO
                   (whispers)
            What the fuck are these people
            talking about?  You'd have to be
            crazy on acid to think a joint
            looked like a goddamn cockroach!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            It was clear that we had stumbled
            into a prehistoric gathering.

                         DR. BLUMQUIST
            Now, there are four states of being
            in the cannabis, or marijuana,
            society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and
            Square.  The square is seldom if
            ever cool.  He is not "with it,"
            that is, he doesn't know "what's
            happening." But if he manages to
            figure it out, he moves up a notch
            to "hip."

DUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.

                         DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
            And if he can bring himself to
            approve of what is happening, he
            becomes "groovy." After that, with
            much luck and perseverance, he can
            rise to the rank of "cool." A cool
            guy... cool guy... cool guy...

                                                           74.


                         COP IN BACK
            Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the
            anthropologist, Margaret Mead's
            strange behavior of late might
            possibly be explained by a private
            marijuana addiction?

                         DR. BLUMQUIST
            I really don't know, but at her
            age, if she did smoke grass, she'd
            have one hell of a trip!

Roars of laughter.

                         GONZO
            I know a hell of a lot better ways
            to waste my time than listening to
            this bullshit.

He stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and
plunges down the aisle to the door.

                         COP IN BACK
            Down in front!

                         GONZO
            Fuck you!  I have to get out!  I
            don't belong here!

                         COP IN BACK
            Good riddance!

He stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to
the stage.

The lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER
MADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.

                         FILM NARRATOR
            KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE
            MAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be
            able to see his eyes because of
            Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will
            be white from inner tension...

DUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF
who necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.

                         FILM NARRATOR
            ... and his pants will be crusted
            with semen from constantly jacking
            off when he can't find a rape
            victim...

                                                           75.


DUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,
he gets up, hand over mouth.

                         DUKE
            Pardon me, I feel sick.

                         FILM NARRATOR
            He will stagger and babble when
            questioned.  He will not respect
            your badge.  The Dope Fiend fears
            nothing.  He will attack, for no
            reason, with every weapon at his
            command -- including yours...

DUKE heads for the exit.

                         DUKE
            Sorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling
            sick...

                         FILM NARRATOR
            BEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a
            suspected marijuana addict should
            use all necessary force immediately.
            One stitch in time [on him] will
            usually save nine on you.

DUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.

INT. CASINO BAR - DAY

DUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING
COP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT
ATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.

                         DA
            I'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't
            have much trouble from drugs where
            I come from...

                         GONZO
            You will.  One of these nights
            you'll wake up and find a junkie
            tearing your bedroom apart.

                         DA
            Naw!

                         GONZO
            They'll climb right into your
            bedroom and sit on your chest with
            big Bowie knives.  They might even
            sit on your wife's chest.  Put the
            blade right down on her throat.

                                                           76.


                         DA
            Not down in my parts.

DUKE joins them.

                         DUKE
                   (to WAITRESS)
            Rum and ice, please.

                         DA
                   (looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)
            You're another one of these
            California boys.  Your friend
            here's been tellin' us about dope
            fiends.

                         DUKE
            They're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.
            And sure as hell not in the South.
            They like warm weather... You'd
            never believe it.  In L.A. it's out
            of control.  First it was drugs,
            now it's witchcraft.

                         DA
            Witchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!

The BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the
conversation.

                         GONZO
            Read the newspapers.

                         DUKE
            Man, you don't know trouble until
            you have to face down a bunch of
            these addicts gone crazy for human
            sacrifice!

                         DA
            Naw!  That's science fiction stuff!

                         DUKE
            Not where we operate.

                         GONZO
            Hell, in Malibu alone, these
            goddamn Satan worshippers kill six
            or eight people every day.  All
            they want is the blood.  They'll
            take people right off the street if
            they have to.

                                                           77.


                         DUKE
            Just the other day we had a case
            where they grabbed a girl right out
            of a McDonald's hamburger stand.
            She was a waitress, about sixteen
            years old... with a lot of people
            watching, too!

The BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more
furiously.

                         DA
            What happened?  What did they do to
            her?

                         GONZO
            Do?  Jesus Christ, man.  They
            chopped her goddamn head off right
            there in the parking lot!  Then
            they cut all kinds of holes in her
            head and sucked out the blood!

                         DA
                   (DA ad-libs a
                   summation of the crime)
            And nobody did anything?

                         DUKE
            What could they do?  The guy that
            took the head was about six-seven,
            and maybe three-hundred pounds.  He
            was packing two Lugers, and the
            others had M-16s.

                         GONZO
            They just ran back out into Death
            Valley -- you know, where Manson
            turned up...

                         DUKE
            Like big lizards.

                         GONZO
            ... and every one of them stacked
            naked...

                         DA
            Naked!?

                         DUKE
            Naked.

                                                           78.


                         GONZO
            Yeh, naked!... except for the
            weapons.

                         DUKE
            They were all veterans.

                         DA
            Veterans?!!!?

Agog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes
the glass -- faster and faster...

                         GONZO
            Yeh.  The big guy used to be a
            major in the Marines.

                         DA
            A major!

                         GONZO
            We know where he lives, but we
            can't get near the house.

                         DA
            Naw!  Not a major.

                         GONZO
            He wanted the pineal gland.

                         DA
            Really?

                         GONZO
            That's how he got so big.  When he
            quit the Marines he was just a
            little guy.

                         DUKE
            Usually, it's whole families.
            During the night.  Most of them
            don't even wake up until they feel
            their heads going -- and then, of
            course, it's too late.

The glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.

                         DUKE (CONT'D)
            Happens every day.

DUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.

                                                           79.


                         DUKE (CONT'D)
            Three more rums.  Plenty of ice.
            Maybe a handful of lime chunks.

                         WAITRESS
            Are you guys with the police
            convention upstairs?

                         DA
            We sure are, Miss.

                         WAITRESS
            I thought so.  I never heard that
            kind of talk around here before.
            Jesus Christ!  How do you guys
            stand that kind of work?

                         GONZO
                   (grinning)
            We like it.  It's groovy.

The WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.

                         DUKE
            What's wrong with you?  Hell,
            somebody has to do it.

                         GONZO
            Hurry up with those drinks.  We're
            thirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine
            a Bloody Mary.

                         DA
                   (whacks his fist on
                   the bar)
            Hell, I really hate to hear this.
            Because everything that happens in
            California seems to get down our
            way, sooner or later.  Mostly
            Atlanta.  But that was back when
            the goddamn bastards were peaceful.
            All we had to do was to keep 'em
            under surveillance.  They didn't
            roam around much... But now Jesus,
            it seems nobody's safe.

                         GONZO
                   (with a conspiratorial
                   nod)
            You're going to need to take the
            bull by the horns -- go to the mat
            with this scum.

                                                           80.


                         DA
            What do you mean by that?

                         GONZO
            You know what I mean.  We've done
            it before and we can damn well do
            it again!

                         DUKE
            Cut their goddamn heads off.  Every
            one of them.  That's what we're
            doing in California.

                         DA
                   (stupefied)
            WHAT?

                         GONZO
            Sure.  It's all on the Q.T., but
            everybody who matters is with us
            all the way down the line.

                         DUKE
            We keep it quiet.  It's not the
            kind of thing you'd want to talk
            about upstairs.  Not with the press
            around.

                         DA
                   (recovering slightly)
            Hell, no.  We'd never hear the
            goddamn end of it.

                         DUKE
            Dobermans don't talk.

                         DA
            What?

                         GONZO
            Sometimes it's easier to just rip
            out the backstraps.

                         DUKE
            They'll fight like hell if you try
            to take the head without the dogs.

                         DA
            God almighty!
                   (muttering in a daze)
            I don't think I should tell my wife
            about this.  She'd never understand.
            You know how women are.

                                                           81.


DUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.

                         DUKE
            Just be thankful your heart is
            young and strong.

DUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the
swirling ice in drink.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.

GONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the
bathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.

The phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,
picks up the phone.

                         DUKE
            What's the message?  My light is
            blinking.

                         CLERK (V/O)
            Ah, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one
            message: "Call Lucy at the Americana
            Hotel, room 1600."

                         DUKE
            Holy shit!

DUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the
bathroom -- looking like death.

                         DUKE
            Lucy called.

GONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.

                         GONZO
            What?

The telephone rings.  DUKE answers.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY

A worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.

                         CLERK
            Mr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm
            sorry we were cut off a moment
            ago... I thought I should call
            again, because I was wondering...

                                                           82.


INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY

                         DUKE
            WHAT?
                   (hand over the PHONE)
            What was that crazy bitch said to
            him?
                   (screams)
            There's a war on, man!  People are
            being killed!

                         CLERK (V/O)
            Killed?

                         DUKE
            IN VIETNAM!  ON THE GODDAMN
            TELEVISION!

                         CLERK (V/O)
            Oh... yes... yes... This terrible
            war.  When will it end?

                         DUKE
            Tell me.  What do you want?

In the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his
stash from the lining.

                         CLERK (V/O)
            The woman who left that message for
            you sounded very disturbed.  I
            think she was crying...

                         DUKE
            Crying?  Why was she crying?

                         CLERK (V/O)
            Well, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.
            But since I know you're here with
            the Police Convention...

                         DUKE
            Look, you want to be gentle with
            that woman if she ever calls again.
            We're watching her very carefully...
            this woman has been into laudanum.
            It's a controlled experiment, but I
            suspect we'll need your cooperation
            before this thing is over.

                         CLERK (V/O)
                   (hesitantly)
            Well, certainly... We're always
            happy to cooperate with the police...

                                                           83.


                         DUKE
            Don't worry.  You're protected.
            Just treat this poor woman like
            you'd treat any other human being
            in trouble.

                         CLERK (V/O)
            What?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what
            you mean... Yes... so, you'll be
            responsible then?

                         DUKE
            Of course.  And now I have to get
            back to the news.  Send up some ice.

He hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.

                         GONZO
            Good work.  They'll treat us like
            goddamn lepers after that.

                         DUKE
                   (slowly, carefully)
            Lucy is looking for you.

                         GONZO
                   (laughing)
            No, she's looking for you.

                         DUKE
            Me?

                         GONZO
            She really flipped over you.  The
            only way I could get rid of her was
            by saying you were taking me out to
            the desert for a showdown -- that
            you wanted me out of the way so you
            could have her all to yourself.
                   (laughing again)
            I guess she figures you won.  That
            phone message wasn't for me, was it?

A look of stunned realization from DUKE...

INT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY

LUCY is on the witness stand.

                         LUCY
            Yessir, those two men in the dock
            are the ones who gave me the LSD
            and took me to the hotel.

                                                           84.


A doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate.

                         LUCY
            I don't know for sure what they
            done to me, but I remember it was
            horrible.

                         JUDGE
            Twenty years... and Double
            Castration!

The JUDGE bangs his gavel.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

DUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase.

                         GONZO
            Wait!  You can't leave me alone in
            this snake pit.  This room is in my
            name.

DUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried.

                         GONZO
            OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call
            her.  I'll get her off our backs.
            You're right.  She's my problem.

                         DUKE
            It's gone too far.

                         GONZO
            Relax.  Let me handle this.
                   (dials the PHONE,
                   snaps angrily at DUKE)
            You'd make a piss-poor lawyer.
            ...Room 1600, please.
                   (to DUKE)
            As your attorney, I advise you not
            to worry.
                   (nods towards bathroom)
            Take a hit out of that little brown
            bottle in my shaving kit.

DUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a
label: "DRINK ME."

                         DUKE
            What is this?

                                                           85.


                         GONZO
            You won't need much.  Just a little
            tiny taste, that stuff makes pure
            mescaline seem like ginger-beer.
            Adrenochrome.

DUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.

                         DUKE
            Adrenochrome...

                         GONZO
                   (into PHONE)
            Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got
            your message...what?  Hell, no, I
            taught the bastard a lesson he'll
            never forget... what?  No, not
            dead, but he won't be bothering
            anybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left
            him out there, I stomped him, then
            pulled all his teeth out...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a
            terrible thing to lay on somebody
            with a head full of acid."

DUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies
it -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...

                         GONZO
                   (to PHONE)
            But here's the problem.  That
            bastard cashed a bad check
            downstairs and gave you as a
            reference.  They'll be looking for
            both of you.  Yeah, I know, but you
            can't judge a book by its cover,
            Lucy.  Some people are just
            basically rotten... Anyway, the
            last thing you want to do is call
            this hotel again; they'll trace the
            call and put you straight behind
            bars... no, I'm moving to the
            Tropicana right away.  I have to
            go, they've got the phone tapped.
            Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but
            it's all over now... OH MY GOD!
            THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!
                   (throws the PHONE
                   down; shouts)
            No!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent!
            It was Duke!  I swear to God!
                         (MORE)

                                                           86.


                         GONZO (CONT'D)
                   (stomps the PHONE; moans)
            No, I don't know where she is.
            You'll never catch Lucy!  She's
            gone!  I swear, I don't know where
            she is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!
                   (slams the PHONE down)


GONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.

                         GONZO
            Well.  That's that.  She's probably
            stuffing herself down the
            incinerator about now.  That's the
            last we should be hearing from Lucy.
                   (fumbling with the
                   hash pipe)
            Where's the opium?

DUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY
STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I remember slumping on the bed, his
            performance had given me a bad jolt.
            For a moment I thought his mind had
            snapped -- that he actually believed
            he was being attacked by invisible
            enemies.  But the room was quiet
            again.

DUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.

                         DUKE
            Where'd you get this?

                         GONZO
            Never mind, it's absolutely pure.

                         DUKE
            Jesus... what kind of monster
            client have you picked up this time?
            There's only one source for this
            stuff -- the adrenaline gland from
            a living human body!

GONZO turns to smile at DUKE.

                                                           87.


                         GONZO
            I know, but the guy didn't have any
            cash to pay me.  He's one of these
            Satanism freaks.  He offered me
            human blood -- said it would take
            me higher than I've ever been in my
            life.
                   (laughs -- struts
                   round DUKE -- eyes
                   bright with expectation)
            I thought he was kidding, so I told
            him I'd just as soon have an ounce
            or so of pure adrenochrome -- or
            maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland
            to chew on.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I could already feel the stuff
            working on me -- the first wave
            felt like a combination of mescaline
            and methedrine -- maybe I should
            take a swim, I thought...

DUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...

                         GONZO
            Yeah, they nailed this guy for
            child molesting.  He swore he
            didn't do it. "Why should I fuck
            with children?" he says. "They're
            too small." Christ, werewolf is
            entitled to legal counsel.  I
            didn't dare turn the creep down.
            He might have picked up a letter
            opener and gone after my pineal
            gland!

GONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS
GOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.

                         DUKE
            Why not?  We should get some of
            that.  Just eat a big handful and
            see what happens.

                         GONZO
            Some of what?

                         DUKE
                   (spitting words)
            Extract of pineal!

                                                           88.


                         GONZO
                   (STARING AT DUKE WITH
                   A STRANGE SMILE)
            Sure.  That's a good idea.  One
            whiff of that shit would turn you
            into something out of a goddamn
            medical encyclopedia.

GONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.

                         GONZO
            Man, your head would swell up like
            a watermelon, you'd probably gain
            about a hundred pounds in two
            hours...

A CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.

                         DUKE
            Right!

                         GONZO
            ... grow claws... bleeding warts.

GONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.

                         DUKE
            Yes!

                         GONZO
            ... then you'd notice about six
            huge hairy tits swelling up on your
            back...

A TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A
FLAME RED DEMON!

                         DUKE
            Fantastic!

DUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY
at the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His
heels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,
EYEBALLS SWELLING.

GONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.

                         GONZO
            you'd go blind... your body would
            turn to wax... they'd have to put
            you in a wheelbarrow and...

GONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals
GONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.

                                                           89.


                         GONZO
            Man I'll try about anything; but
            I'd never touch a pineal gland.

                         DUKE
            FINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What
            happened?!  What about the glands?

GONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...
towards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...

                         GONZO
            Jesus, that stuff got right on top
            of you, didn't it.

VEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red.
OVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!

                         DUKE
            Maybe you could just... shove me
            into the pool, or something...

GONZO shakes his head disgustedly.

                         GONZO
            If I put you in the pool right now,
            you'd sink like a goddamn stone.
            You took too much.  Jesus, look at
            your face, you're about to explode.

GONZO sits back down... watching the TV.

                         GONZO
            Don't try and fight it, or you'll
            get brain bubbles.  Strokes,
            aneurysms.  You'll just wither up
            and die.

DUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO
PARALYSIS.

AND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF
RICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.

                         NIXON
            Sacrifice... sacrifice...
            sacrifice...

DUKE PASSES OUT.

BLACK SCREEN

                                                           90.


INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Darkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- "Put the
lime in the coconut and mix em all up..."

                         DUKE (V/O)
            What kind of rat-bastard psychotic
            would play that song -- right now,
            at this moment?

DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies,
awkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been
there days -- months.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            When I came to the general back
            alley ambiance of the suite was so
            rotten, so incredibly foul.  How
            long had I been lying there?  Hours?
            Days?  Months?  All these signs of
            violence.  What had happened?

DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE
SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving
whisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights
replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,
pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered
on a shattered mirror.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was evidence in this room of
            excessive consumption of almost
            every type of drug known to
            civilized man since 1544 AD.

DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --
HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            But what kind of addict would need
            all these coconut husks and crushed
            honeydew rinds?  Would the presence
            of junkies account for all these
            uneaten french fries?  These
            puddles of glazed ketchup on the
            bureau?  Maybe so, but then why all
            this booze?  And these crude
            pornographic photos smeared with
            mustard that had dried to a hard
            yellow crust...

DUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT
RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.

                                                           91.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            These were not the hoof prints of
            your normal god-fearing junkie.  It
            was too savage, too aggressive.

QUICK FLASHBACK:

GONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:

BACK IN THE ROOM:

DUKE stares at the smashed mirror.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Grim memories and bad flashbacks.

In the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN
VOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.

DUKE unzips and pisses.  THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE
MAGNUM .357!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Something ugly had happened.  I was
            sure of it...

DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.

The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.

DUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out
of the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE
SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...
sleeping on the sofa.

The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.

A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO
grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is
muffling her screams with an ice bag.

                         MAID
            Please... please... I'm only the
            maid.  I didn't mean nothin!...

                         DUKE
                   (jumps up from the
                   bed, flashing his
                   press badge)
            YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!

                                                           92.


                         GONZO
                   (to DUKE)
            She must have used a pass key.  I
            was polishing my shoes in the
            closet when I noticed her sneaking
            in-so I took her.

DUKE shakes his head.

                         DUKE
                   (barks at the MAID)
            What made you do it?  Who paid you
            off?

                         MAID
            Nobody.  I'm the maid!

                         GONZO
            You're lying!  You were after the
            evidence.  Who put you up to
            this -- the manager?

                         MAID
            I don't know what you're talking
            about!

                         GONZO
            Bullshit!  You're just as much a
            part of it as they are!

                         MAID
            Part of what?

                         DUKE
            The dope ring.  You must know
            what's going on in this hotel.  Why
            do you think we're here?

                         MAID
                   (blubbering)
            I know you're cops, but I thought
            you were just here for that
            convention.  I swear!  All I wanted
            to do was clean up the room.  I
            don't know anything about dope!

GONZO laughs.

                         GONZO
            Come on, baby don't try to tell us
            you never heard of the Grange Gorman.

                                                           93.


                         MAID
            No!  No!  I swear to Jesus I never
            heard of that stuff!

                         DUKE
            Maybe she's telling the truth.
            Maybe she's not part of it.

                         MAID
            No!  I swear I'm not!

                         GONZO
                   (long pause)
            In that case, maybe she can help.

                         MAID
            Yes!  I'll help you all you need!
            I hate dope!

                         DUKE
            So do we, lady.

                         GONZO
                   (helping her up)
            I think we should put her on the
            payroll.  See what she comes up with.

                         DUKE
            Do you think you can handle it?

                         MAID
            What?

                         GONZO
            One phone call every day.  Just
            tell us what you've seen.  Don't
            worry if it doesn't add up, that's
            our problem.

GONZO hustles the MAID to the door.

                         MAID
            You'd pay me for that?

                         DUKE
            You're damn right.  But the first
            time you say anything about this,
            to anybody -- you'll go straight to
            prison for the rest of your life.
            What's your name?

                         MAID
            Alice.  Just ring Linen Service and
            ask for Alice.

                                                           94.


                         GONZO
            Alright, Alice... you'll be
            contacted by Inspector Rock.
            Arthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a
            politician.

                         DUKE
            Inspector Rock will pay you.  In
            cash.  A thousand dollars on the
            ninth of every month.

                         MAID
            Oh Lord!  I'd do just about anything
            for that!

                         GONZO
            You and a lot of other people.

                         DUKE
            The password is: "One Hand Washes
            The Other." The minute you hear
            that, you say "I fear nothing."

                         MAID
            I fear nothing.

She repeats the password several times while they listen to
make sure she has it right.

                         GONZO
            Oh, and don't bother to make up the
            room.  That way we won't have to
            risk another of these little
            incidents, will we?

                         MAID
            Whatever you say, gentlemen.  I
            can't tell you how sorry I am about
            what happened...

                         GONZO
            Don't worry, it's all over now.
            Thank God for the decent people.

She smiles, repeating to herself "One Hand Washes The Other"
as GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.

CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.

A grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.

                         GONZO ON TAPE
            ... Thank God for the decent people.

                                                           95.


DUKE sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his
mangled tape recorder in front of him.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Memories of that night are extremely
            hazy...

DUKE fast forwards through the tape -- SEARCHING: "Awwww,
mama... can this really...be the end...?"

EXT. SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET - DAY

The WHITE WHALE waits -- gleaming -- beautiful.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There is a definite obligation,
            when you boom around Vegas in a
            white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a
            certain style.

DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping
basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They
send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.

The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather
at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with
junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.

DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects
a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO
pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering
CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!

A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.

DUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat
flies everywhere.

                         SHOPPER #1
            Hey!  Is that your car?

                         DUKE
            Sure is.

SMASH!  Coconut fragments fly.

                         DUKE
            Any of you folks want the milk?
            We're after the meat.  This is
            honest coconut essence.  Real meat.

SMASH!

                                                           96.


                         SHOPPER #2
            Meat, hell!  Look what you're doing
            to that car!

                         GONZO
            Fuck the car.  They should make
            these things with a goddamn FM radio.

SMASH!

                         DUKE
            Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is
            sucking our dollar balance dry!

                         SHOPPER #3
            Someone should stop them!

SMASH!

                         DUKE
            You poor fools don't understand, do
            you?  This car is the property of
            the World Bank!  That money goes to
            ITALY!

                         SHOPPER #3
            Somebody should call the police!

                         GONZO
            Police?  Are you people crazy?

GONZO confronts the CROWD, hammer in one hand, a coconut in
the other.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
            You folks every heard of ole
            Patrick Henry?  Know what he said?!

Silence -- the CROWD uncomprehending of this STONE DEGENERATE.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
                   (ROARS)
            GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH!

GONZO brings the hammer down on the hood.  CLANG!

A gasp from the CROWD.  Getting ugly.

                         GONZO (CONT'D)
            In Samoa we LOVE THE CONSTITUTION!

                         SHOPPER #3
            Bullshit.

                                                           97.


The CROWD move in.

                         SHOPPER #1
            Call the goddamn police!

GONZO SWINGS THE HAMMER.  CLANG!

                         SHOPPER #4
            Look what they've done to that
            beautiful car!

DUKE jumps in behind the wheel.

                         DUKE
            This crowd is not rational.  They
            can't relate to us.  Let's go!

A final CLANG!  GONZO jumps in.

DUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD.

                         DUKE
            You people voted for Hubert Humphrey!
            You killed Jesus!

They swerve round and through the CROWD.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The crowd broke ranks.  Nobody
            wants to be run over by a Coupe de
            Ville.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE FAST-FORWARDS... PLAYS THE TAPE...

                         VOICE ON TAPE
            You found the American Dream?  In
            this town?

                         DUKE ON TAPE
            We're sitting on the main nerve
            right now...

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO (wearing a single black glove) talk
conspiratorially to a 3RD MAN.  A PLACID ORANGUTAN in a bow
tie sits next to him.  THE BAR IS REVOLVING FASTER THAN
NORMAL.  DUKE IS INSANELY TALKATIVE -- WIRED!

                                                           98.


                         DUKE
            The manager told me a story about
            the owner of this place...about how
            he always wanted to run away and
            join the circus when he was a kid.
            Well, now the bastard has his own
            circus, and a license to steal, too.

                         3RD MAN
            You're right -- he's the model.

                         DUKE
            Absolutely!  Pure Horatio Alger...
            Say...

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE playing the tape.

                         DUKE ON TAPE
            ... how much do you think he'd take
            for the ape?

DUKE fast-forwards again -- searching... TRAFFIC NOISES.
SCREECH OF BRAKES.

                         VOICE ON TAPE
            Holy God!...

A TERRIBLE GRINDING NOISE.

EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

                         RENTAL AGENT
            Holy God!, how did this happen?

                         DUKE
            They beat the shit out of it.

                         RENTAL AGENT
            The top's completely jammed!

The CAR RENTAL AGENT wrestles with the trashed car.

                         DUKE
            Yeah, something's wrong with the
            motor...

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

                         DUKE ON TAPE
            ... The generator light's been on
            red ever since I drove the thing
            into Lake Mead on a water test...

                                                           99.


A HUGE SPLASH...

The tape's gone too far.

                         DUKE
            No, no.  Shit...

DUKE races the tape BACKWARDS... Then, SIRENS HOWL.

                         DUKE ON TAPE
            Where's the ape?  I'm ready to
            write a check.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS BAR - NIGHT

DUKE is standing in the middle of A SEMI-DESTROYED BAZOOKO
CIRCUS REVOLVING BAR.  Mirrors are broken.  People are
recovering from some kind of battle.  THE BAR SPINS MADLY.
DUKE IS INSANELY WIRED.

                         3RD MAN
            Forget it, he just attacked an old
            man... he took a bite out of the
            bartender's head!  The cops took
            the ape away.

                         DUKE
            Goddamnit!  What's the bail?  I
            want that ape!  I've already
            reserved two first-class seats on
            the plane.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was every reason to believe
            that we had been heading for
            trouble, that we'd pushed our luck
            a bit far...

INT. WHITE WHALE ON THE STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

GONZO SCREAMS ABUSE out of the window at a Ford alongside
the VOMIT STREAKED WHITE WHALE.  DUKE MAKES A SUPERHUMAN
EFFORT TO STAY ON THE ROAD.

                         GONZO
            Hey there!  You folks want to buy
            some heroin?

In the Ford: TWO COUPLES -- MIDDLE-AGED AMERICAN FACES
FROZEN IN SHOCK -- stare straight ahead.  GONZO leans out --
close to them.

                                                          100.


                         GONZO
            Hey, honkies!  Goddamnit, I'm
            serious.  I want to sell you some
            pure fucking smack!

No reaction.

                         GONZO
            Cheap heroin!  This is the real
            stuff!  You won't get hooked.  I
            just got back from Vietnam!  This
            is scag, folks.  Pure scag!

The lights change.  The Ford bolts.  DUKE keeps pace with
them.

                         GONZO
            Shoot!  Fuck!  Scag!  Blood!
            Heroin!  Rape!  Cheap!  Communist!
            Jab it right in your fucking
            eyeballs!

The MAN IN THE BACK SEAT suddenly loses control -- enraged,
lunges against the glass, trying to get at GONZO.

                         MAN IN CAR
            You dirty bastards!  Pull over and
            I'll kill you!  God damn you!  You
            bastards!

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

BACK IN THE SUITE:

The tapes runs:

                         MAN IN CAR ON TAPE
            You dirty bastards!

An ugly squeal of brakes.

                         GONZO ON TAPE
            Shit, he was trying to bite me!  I
            shoulda maced the fucker!

DUKE fast forwards the tape.  The TAPE MANGLES -- the sounds
ski to a halt...

DUKE grabs the nearest tool -- uses it to hook out the tape,
then realizes... IT'S GONZO'S RAZOR-SHARP FOLDING KNIFE... A
CHILLING MOMENT...

DUKE turns the knife over... THERE'S A DRIED CRIMSON SPOT ON
THE BLADE... OR IS IT DRIED MASHED POTATOES?

                                                          101.


READ ON TO FIND OUT!

                         DUKE
                   (remembering)
            Back door beauty!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The mentality of Las Vegas is so
            grossly atavistic that a really
            massive crime often slips by
            unrecognized.

DUKE SCRAPS A LITTLE OF THE CRUST -- TASTES IT...

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            The possibility of physical and
            mental collapse is very real... No
            sympathy for the devil; keep that
            in mind.  Buy the ticket, take the
            ride...

HE HEARS THE SOUNDS OF SOMEONE BEHIND BEATEN UP...

                         VOICE OFF
            Shit!  Faggot!  Bastard!

EXT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

WHACK!  SHADOWY FIGURES beat up a MAN -- give him A GOOD
KICKING.  BRUTAL AND UGLY.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            North Vegas is where you go when
            you've fucked up once too often on
            The Strip and when you're not even
            welcome in the cut-rate Downtown
            places.

PAN to reveal a seedy diner -- THE NORTH STAR CAFE in the
background.  Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the
counter.

INT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed
            like a fairly safe haven from our
            storms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just
            a place to rest and regroup.  I
            wasn't even hungry.

GONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE
BEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper.

                                                          102.


                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was nothing in the atmosphere
            of the North Star to put me on my
            guard...

                         GONZO
                   (to WAITRESS)
            Two glasses of ice water with ice.

The WAITRESS brings the ice water.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            She looked like a burnt out
            caricature of Jane Russell.  She
            was definitely in charge here...

GONZO gulps down his glass of water and hands her a napkin.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            He did it very casually, but I knew
            that our peace was about to be
            shattered.

                         DUKE
            What was that?

GONZO shrugs.

The WAITRESS stands at the end of the counter with her back
to them while she ponders the napkin... She turns.

                         WAITRESS
            What is this?

                         GONZO
            A napkin.

THE WAITRESS slams the napkin down on the counter.

                         WAITRESS
            Don't give me that bullshit!  I
            know what it means!  You goddamn
            fat pimp bastard.

                         GONZO
            That's the name of a horse I used
            to own.  What's wrong with you?

                         WAITRESS
            You sonofabitch!  I take a lot of
            shit in this place, but I sure as
            hell don't have to take it off a
            SPIC PIMP!

                                                          103.


GONZO GOES VERY VERY STILL AT THIS...

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Jesus.  I thought, what's happening?

DUKE picks up the napkin.  On it is printed in careful red
letters: "BACK DOOR BEAUTY?"

                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
            The question mark was emphasized.

                         WAITRESS
                   (screams)
            Pay your bill and get the hell out!
            You want me to call the cops?

                         GONZO
            Spic pimp?

GONZO's hand goes inside his shirt.  He PULLS OUT THE RAZOR-
SHARP HUNTING KNIFE.

GONZO KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE WAITRESS.  He walks about six
feet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone.
He SLICES IT OFF, then brings the receiver back to his stool
and sits down.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            I was stupid with shock -- not
            knowing whether to run or start
            laughing.

                         GONZO
                   (casual)
            How much is the lemon meringue pie?

                         DUKE (V/O)
            Her eyes were turgid with fear, but
            her brain was functioning on some
            basic motor survival level.

                         WAITRESS
                   (blurting -- on automatic)
            Thirty-five cents!

                         GONZO
                   (laughing)
            I mean the whole pie.

The WAITRESS MOANS.  GONZO places a $5 BILL on the counter.

                         GONZO
            Let's say five dollars.  Okay?

                                                          104.


GONZO walks round the counter TAKING THE PIE OUT OF THE
DISPLAY CASE.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            The sight of the blade had triggered
            bad memories.  The glazed look in
            her eyes said her throat had been
            cut.  She was still in the grip of
            paralysis when we left.

DUKE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT.

GONZO urges him out the door.  The camera retreats with them.

The WAITRESS STANDS THERE -- PETRIFIED.  Alone in a lousy
bar at night.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE's face as he stares at the knife -- remembering...

                         GONZO (V/O)
            Drive!  Drive!  Drive!  We have
            fifteen fucking minutes to get me
            on that plane!

EXT. ROAD ON OUTSKIRTS OF LAS VEGAS - DAY

The WHITE WHALE, looking like shit -- it's TOP HALF UP,
TORN, SLAPPING IN THE WIND -- ROARS THROUGH AN INTERSECTION
as the light turns red.

DR. GONZO FRANTICALLY PAWS OVER A MAP.

DUKE drives -- SILENT AND FURIOUS -- sick to his stomach
with the PSYCHOTIC GONZO.

                         GONZO
            What are you doing?  You were
            supposed to turn back there!

                         DUKE (V/O)
            We had abused every rule that Vegas
            lived by -- burning the locals,
            abusing the tourists, terrifying
            the help.  The only chance now, I
            felt, was the possibility that we'd
            gone to such excess that nobody in
            the position to bring the hammer
            down on us could possibility
            believe it.

DUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.

                                                          105.


                         GONZO
            Jesus Christ!!!

There, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her
paintings under her arm -- looking lost.  SHE LOOKS UP WITH
A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION...

DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS
OFF.

EXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.  GONZO
looks wildly around.

                         GONZO
            Goddamnit!  We're lost!  What are
            we doing out here on this
            godforsaken road?

GONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT
RUNWAY.

                         GONZO
            The airport is over there!

                         DUKE
            Never missed a plane yet.

DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the
WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING,
HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight
up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER
A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the
RUNWAY.

GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He
throws a worried look at DUKE.

                         DUKE
            I'll drop you right next to the
            plane.

They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET
ENGINE SCREAM.

                         GONZO
            No!  I can't get out!  They'll
            crucify me.  I'll have to take the
            blame!

                                                          106.


                         DUKE
                   (irritatedly)
            Ridiculous!  Just say you were
            hitchhiking to the airport and I
            picked you up.  You never saw me
            before.  Shit, this town is full of
            white Cadillac convertibles.  I
            plan to go through there so fast
            that nobody will even glimpse the
            goddamn license plate.  You ready?

                         GONZO
            Why not?  But for Christ's sake,
            just do it fast!

EXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY

DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO
JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.

DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.

                         DUKE
            Hey!

GONZO stops -- turns.

                         DUKE
            Don't take any guff from those
            swine.  Remember, if you have any
            trouble you can always send a
            telegram to the Right People.

                         GONZO
            Yeah... Explaining my Position.
            Some asshole wrote a poem about
            that once...

GONZO pauses.

                         GONZO
            Probably good advice, if you have
            shit for brains.

GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT
TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND
LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There he goes -- one of God's own
            prototypes -- a high powered mutant
            of some kind never even considered
            for mass production.  Too weird to
            live and too rare to die.

                                                          107.


DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH
THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT

On the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find
DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his
typewriter.

                         DUKE
            We are all wired into a survival
            trip now.  No more of the speed
            that fueled that 60's.  That was
            the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.
            He crashed around America selling
            "consciousness expansion" without
            ever giving a thought to the grim
            meat-hook realities that were lying
            in wait for all the people who took
            him seriously...

DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly
rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT
IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.

                         DUKE
            All those pathetically eager acid
            freaks who thought they could buy
            Peace and Understanding for three
            bucks a hit.  But their loss and
            failure is ours too.  What Leary
            took down with him was the central
            illusion of a whole life-style that
            he helped create...

RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30
FEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE
CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...

                         DUKE
            ... a generation of permanent
            cripples, failed seekers, who never
            understood the essential old-mystic
            fallacy of the Acid Culture: the
            desperate assumption that somebody...
            or at least some force -- is
            tending the light at the end of the
            tunnel.

HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX
SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON
SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT
LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.

                                                          108.


EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE
DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out
of the back seat as he takes a bump.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            There was only one road back to L.A.
            US Interstate 15, just a flat-out
            high speed burn through Baker and
            Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the
            Hollywood Freeway straight into
            frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,
            just another freak in the Freak
            Kingdom.

DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING
facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon
sign that flashes beer.

                         DUKE
            Ahhh.  Wonderful.

DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.

INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY

DUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all
about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON
WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE
RAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD
MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden
bar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.

                         PROPRIETOR
            What'll you have?

DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.

                         DUKE
                   (doubtfully)
            Ballantine Ale...?

THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND
RELAXES.

                         DUKE
            Hard to find it served like this
            anymore.

As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE
AMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY
PIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack
reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.

                                                          109.


                         PROPRIETOR
            Where ya comin' from, young man?

                         DUKE
            Las Vegas.

                         PROPRIETOR
            A great town, that Vegas.  I bet
            you had good luck there.  You're
            the type.

                         DUKE
            I know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.

                         PROPRIETOR
                   (trustingly)
            That's a fine combination.  You
            can't lose.

A LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS
REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...
KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.

                         DUKE
                   (caught off guard... muttering)
            Oh, my God!...

                         PROPRIETOR
                   (not understanding)
            This is my granddaughter...

                         DUKE
                   (recovering)
            Don't worry...
                   (leans forward in confidence)
            ... and I'm actually the District
            Attorney from Ignoto County.
                   (winks)
            Just another good American like
            yourself.

A MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.

Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the
back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.

WHO FEELS ASHAMED.

DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.

EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY

A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.
Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...

                                                          110.


A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.

Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags
step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...

DUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the
trembling dash... DUKE catches it...

ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...

DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --
TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.

                         DUKE
            HOLY SHIT!!!

DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT
THE MARINES.

                         DUKE
            GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!

DUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS
IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE
CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY

DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!

DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.

                         DUKE (V/O)
            My heart was filled with joy.  I
            felt like a monster reincarnation
            of Horatio Alger... a man on the
            move... and just sick enough to be
            totally confident.

The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

                             END
FEAST

                                         5/3/2004

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. DESERT -- DAY

               The white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a 
               cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill.

               Far in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its 
               way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES 
               perched on a barren tree watch the intruders.

               EXT. DESERT -- DAY

               The truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching 
               coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky, 
               weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut 
               and naive).

               Chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth 
               before them.

                                     CHIEF
                         This is it.

                                     LANKY
                         Why did it have to be these caves...

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Is something wrong?

                                     LANKY
                              (to College Boy)
                         Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'.

               Chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck.

               The logo on the rear gate reads "WIGWAM WASTE MANAGEMENT." 

                                     CHIEF
                         Let's get that first barrel.

               The gate drops revealing their full load of YELLOW BARRELS 
               bearing the familiar BIOHAZARD WASTE symbol.

               INT. CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER

               College Boy and Lanky steer a cart loaded with the first 
               barrel inside. Chief's lone beam of light leads the men.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         What's with the awkward silence?

                                     LANKY
                         You don't know?

               College Boy shakes his head "no" and they set the cart down.

                                     CHIEF
                         Last winter, a man kidnapped a little 
                         girl and holed up in one of these 
                         caves. The cops had him pinned down 
                         and began to move in. This guy started 
                         shooting... but he wasn't aiming at 
                         the officers...
                              (getting closer)
                         ...he was firing at something inside.

               College Boy is rapt.

                                     CHIEF
                         When the dust cleared, all they found 
                         was the little girl's shoes.
                              (beat)
                         With the feet still in 'em.

               Something GRABS College Boy's ankles, causing him to jump.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Ahh!!!

               Lanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The 
               two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed.

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Assholes.

                                     CHIEF
                         Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself 
                         when my boss pulled that one on me.

                                     LANKY
                         I went well beyond nearly.

               Then, a sound. All eyes turn.

                                     CHIEF
                         What was that?

                                     COLLEGE BOY
                         Once was plenty, fellas.

                                     CHIEF
                         Shhhh...

               As Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe.

               Instantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A 
               group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, 
               CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams.

               MEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched 
               a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around 
               her neck. She charges towards Chief.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Stop it right there! You will not 
                         rape Mother Nature one more day!

               Panicked, Chief drops his pick-axe and stumbles back.

                                     CHIEF
                         Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

               In unison, the hippies start CHANTING.

                                     HIPPIE GROUP
                         Mother Nature is not a whore/Don't 
                         dump in her any-more/Mother Nature 
                         is not a whore/Don't dump in her any-
                         more...

               A BEARDED CAMERAMAN with a huge KEY RING on his belt, films 
               the whole event. The three men are stopped in their tracks.  

                                     CHIEF
                         Take it easy! We have a permit!

                                     MEAN GREEN
                              (handing a document)
                         And we have an injunction from the 
                         State to prevent any dumping in these 
                         caverns! This is virgin land! The 
                         aqueducts in these caves bring 
                         drinking water to our families, and 
                         its piping provides drainage for our 
                         farms that enrich this barren land! 
                         And it won't be tainted by waste of 
                         any kind! Not now! Not ever!

               Chief, shaken, confirms the injunction and hands it back.

                                     CHIEF
                         Fine, just back off!

               He snaps his fingers, motioning to the barrel.

                                     CHIEF
                         Let's roll... Now-now-now!

               Backing away, looking to Mean Green.

                                     CHIEF
                         How do you guys always know where 
                         we're going?

                                     MEAN GREEN
                              (with a smirk)
                         I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT!

               Hastily, the men roll the barrel out of the cave.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Score one for the green team!!!

               The hippies let out a spirited cheer. One pulls out a 
               tambourine, drums the beat for KUM BI YA. The rest join in 
               the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their 
               truck and peel away.

                                     BEARDED CAMERAMAN
                         Hey, man, that was righteous, but I 
                         need a shot with the sign up.

               At the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, FUZZY, moves 
               to hang a GREENPEACE sign. Mean Green strokes the cave wall.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         We saved you today, ol' gal.

               Fuzzy hammers the sign in, but hits too hard, causing a breach 
               in the rock wall.

                                     FUZZY
                         Oh, fuck!

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Sister, why do you always swing for 
                         the fences?

                                     FUZZY
                              (eyeing breach)
                         It's okay, but I... I think I see 
                         something in there... something shiny.

               Fuzzy puts her face up to the hole for a closer look. The 
               rest of the hippie-chain moves in closer.

                                     FUZZY
                         Oh my, it looks like diamonds!

               CHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into Fuzzy's skull. 
               Blood SPLATTERS on the hippies.

               Bearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach.

               Fuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles 
               forward.

               Mean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't.

               One by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death.

               Ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls.

               Bearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him.

                                     MEAN GREEN
                         Give me the keys!!!

               Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing 
               both his arms.

               Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She 
               HAMMERS at the chain around her waist.

               Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she 
               BREAKS the chain, popping herself free.

               She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her 
               fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening. 
               She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!

               Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness. 
               The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light. 
               As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK...

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Neon light flashes UNITED NATIONS TAVERN. Laughing and music 
               emanates. Besides the bar, there's nothing around for miles.

               A 1985, pristine black Pontiac Trans-Am with a Golden Eagle 
               on the hood pulls up. The rear bumper sticker reads "MY OTHER 
               TOY HAS TITS."

               A weasel-like man with a fat belly and tank-top emerges from 
               the hot rod carrying a VELVET POOL CUE CASE. Freeze on him.

               The rest of the parking lot is scattered with cars and pickup 
               trucks. Bozo lazily makes his way to the bar and pushes 
               through the front entrance --

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bozo passes a man dressed in a cheap suit and standing well 
               over six foot five with frazzled black hair and olive skin.

               Talking with a thick Greek accent, he pleads into a pay phone.

                         crapped out on the side of the road! 
                         I'm not making the conference and I

               Further into the bar, a man in a wheelchair loads a quarter 
               into an old jukebox, but he is instantly pushed away by Bozo.

               Bozo punches in his selection. EDGY CAT (34, samurai pony 
               tail, don't you dare call him an alcoholic) stands by the 
               bar's POOL TABLE powdering his cue.

               The CD spins and an 1980s heavy metal classic KICKS IN.

               Bozo, mouthing the lyrics, struts away.

               P.O.V. - We continue to run. Rapid breathing.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Beer Guy (kinda handsome... just kinda) sets a keg of beer 
               behind the bar. Freeze on him.

               NAME: BEER GUY 
               AGE: 32 
               OCCUPATION: BEER GUY/PART-TIME HOST AT RED LOBSTER 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: WIMPS AND DORKS ARE THE FIRST TO GO... HE'S 
               BOTH

               He talks with BARTENDER (thinning hair, chiseled face, big 
               earring) who preps a drink.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I mean, we'd been together for so 
                         long and then... bang! She drops me. 
                         Since then, it's been like a damn 
                         country song: she's gone, the car's 
                         repossessed, and a father figure 
                         made a pass at me. I'm not saying I 
                         ever had it. But I have definitely 
                         lost it.
                              (beat)
                         Now I haul this swill from armpit to 
                         armpit. I used to be a model for 
                         Christ's sake.

               Coach has been eavesdropping on Beer Guy and approaches.

                                     COACH
                         For what, may I ask?

                                     BEER GUY
                         JC Penny. Spring wear.

               Beer Guy then mimics throwing a sport coat over his shoulder 
               and delivering his "model" cheese smile.

                                     COACH
                         You know, Chach, catching you at 
                         this low point is pure serendipity.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Why is that?

                                     COACH
                         Because I take the rubble of man and 
                         build superstars. In my briefcase 
                         here is a doorway to a self-help 
                         sensation. Give me a minute, because 
                         I'd like to buy you a drink and change 
                         your life forever. I have a brochure --

                                     BARTENDER
                         Save it. We don't deal in pamphlets 
                         'round here. We stick to chemistry. 
                         And his drinks are on me.

               Bartender puts a shot in front of Beer Guy. Behind him, a 
               mounted DEER HEAD is prominently displayed. Freeze on him.

               NAME: BARTENDER 
               AGE: 50 
               OCCUPATION: BARTENDER 
               FUN FACT: SHOT 4 TIMES, STABBED 6 TIMES, BIT BY 1 SQUIRREL 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: READY TO WEAR

               With Coach stumped, Bartender turns to Beer Guy.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Was that the last keg?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Yup, one keg of Beast for the 
                         basement, then the truck's dry.

                                     BARTENDER
                         If you're stayin', move the truck, 
                         boss gets pissed about you using 
                         primo parking.

               Beer Guy downs his shot and hoists the lone keg into the 
               waiting keg elevator.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Right, 'cause this joint's hopping.

               He hits a button and the keg slowly lowers to the basement.

               P.O.V. - We jump over a bush and crash in the dusty earth.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               A glass of beer slides down the bar. A hand GRABS it and 
               puts it on a tray. The woman is pretty though haggard, stained 
               apron and dirty blond hair. Freeze on her.

               Tuffy carries the tray toward a table. She passes a TV mounted 
               on the wall.

               ON TV: A NEWSCASTER, dressed in a coat and tie, talks.

                         protesters will be further complicated 
                         by the unstable conditions of these 
                         deep tunnels. Thus far, no sign of 
                         life has been detected, yet town

               Newscaster spins and an ECLIPSE GRAPHIC appears on screen.

                         On a brighter note, or should I say 
                         a darker note, tomorrow's solar 
                         eclipse will bring out adults and

               Beer Guy pulls the keg from the elevator and places it next 
               to other kegs. A faint conversation brews behind a curtain.

                         We got a problem.

               P.O.V. - We are trucking... labored breathing...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy moves to a table where ADULTERER (bushy mustache, 
               sweater vest, dress shirt) sits with TRAMPY (designer glasses, 
               hair pulled back, tight blue business suit, closet tramp). 

               Freeze on Trampy.

                         He said there was no reason I had to 
                         stay a teller and that if I did good 
                         work and didn't mess up, I could 
                         become an assistant manager within 
                         three years.
                              (pause)
                         Can you believe that?

                                     ADULTERER
                         That sounds great.

               LIFE EXPECTANCY: WORSE THAN TRAMPY

               Adulterer reaches into his pocket to pay the tab, but he 
               inadvertently pulls out his hidden WEDDING RING.

                                     TRAMPY
                         That sounds like bullshit! I could 
                         be an assistant manager at The Lake 
                         Arrowhead Casino for knowing the 
                         fuckin' alphabet to G! I'll be twenty 
                         in three months...

               The damning wedding band falls and bounces. As it rolls, 
               Tuffy, Trampy and Adulterer watch.

               The ring stops, standing still on its side.

               Trampy seethes as she chooses which obscenity to deliver.

               Adulterer slides a wad of cash to Tuffy.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Just bring the whole bottle.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - Sprinting and wheezing. The bar lights are ahead.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy walks back over to the bar adding Adulterer's cash to 
               a fat roll of money. BELLE (stringy blond hair, cute face, 
               brand-spanking new employee) looks up with surprise.

               Freeze on her.

               LIFE EXPECTANCY: SAME ODDS AS PLAYING BELLE IN STAGE VERSION 
               OF "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"

                                     BELLE
                         If I could made that kind of money, 
                         I'd be in Hollywood next week.

               Boss Man walks by and nods to Tuffy, making his way to the 
               rickety side-staircase to the SECOND FLOOR. Tuffy grinds her 
               teeth and moves to the staircase.

                                     TUFFY
                         'Round here, there are ways.

               Boss Man winks at Belle. Pure sleaze.

               Freeze on him.

               NAME: BOSS MAN 
               AGE: 47 
               OCCUPATION: BAR OWNER 
               MOTTO: IF THERE'S GRASS IN THE FIELD, PLAY BALL 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: REGULAR OR EXTRA-CRISPY?

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - Running, approaching the distant bar...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo looks grimly at a pile of CASH on the ledge of the pool 
               table. Edgy Cat sinks the eighth shot of a NINE BALL game.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That cash is gonna look much better 
                         in my pocket.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: mounted head)
                         Ya know, that deer only looks scared 
                         when you're in the room.

               Para rolls up behind Edgy.

                                     PARA
                         Excuse me, please.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         Jesus!

               Edgy looks to Para, distracted. Bozo quickly replaces the 
               WHITE CUE BALL with one hidden in his waistline.

               EXT. BAR -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - The bar's a quarter mile away.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Para's chair back aims at the pool table pocket of which 
               Edgy Cat is lining up for the winning shot.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That's all she wrote...

               SMACK! The nine ball sinks in the pocket, the cue ball 
               ricochets away as intended.

               Para flips a switch under his wheelchair's arm rest. The cue 
               ball strays ODDLY into the pocket near Para. Scratch.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         What?!

                                     BOZO
                         Ohhh, now that's a rough one.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         That's motherfuckin' impossible!

                                     BOZO
                              (crude Oriental accent)
                         Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go 
                         again?

                                     EDGY CAT
                         Goddamn it! NO!

                                     BOZO
                         Oh, come on. Crape Diem!

               Bozo takes the cash from the table. Edgy Cat sulks away 
               cursing to himself and moves to the bar.

               Roadie looks on, sipping a beer.

               Freeze on Roadie.

               P.O.V. - Still running. The bar is getting closer.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo HITS the table of GRANDPA (elderly, white hair, bushy 
               white mustache) and GRANDMA (curly white hair, glasses).

               Freeze on them.

               NAMES: GRANDPA AND GRANDMA

                         Wake up! Check your pants!

                                     GRANDPA
                         Get outta here.

                                     BOZO
                              (mocking)
                         What's that? Wha'cha say? Huh?
                              (to Grandma)
                         How much for the whole night, Grandma?

                                     GRANDMA
                         You should be so lucky.

                                     GRANDPA
                              (re: his fists)
                         This one will stun ya, but this one 
                         will put ya to sleep.

                                     BOZO
                         Whoa!

               Bozo approaches OLD VET (52, long hair with bandanna, dirty 
               beard) HARLEY MOM, (45, bruiser, grizzled, tough as a saddle) 
               and DRUNK GUY at the bar. The sad trio toss peanut shells 
               into three nearby tall, fat peanut barrels.

                                     BOZO
                         You boys wanna try your luck at the 
                         loot?

               Harley mom is offended. Not a word from the others.

                                     BOZO
                         Come on, I'll even throw with my 
                         left hand.

               He turns in disappointment.

                                     BOZO
                         Nothin' but a bunch of butts and 
                         pussies in here!

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               P.O.V. - The bar is close -- we leap a ditch.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               KRASH! Belle DROPS a tray full of drinks behind the bar.

                                     BELLE
                         Shit! Shit! Shit!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Don't sweat it, just clean it up 
                         before he's done.

               He points up to the second floor.

               INT. BAR -- SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy's son CODY (7, innocent, cute) sits on the floor 
               watching TV. Freeze on him.

               NAME: CODY

               Tuffy puts headphones over his ears.

                                     TUFFY
                         Keep these on, sweetheart.

                                     CODY
                         Mommy, I want Nemo.

                                     TUFFY
                         Mommy's working on it.

               Tuffy kisses him and then moves to an adjacent room.

               ADJACENT ROOM

               Tuffy enters the room and takes off her blouse exposing her 
               breasts. She pulls up her skirt and bends over a bedpost.

                                     TUFFY
                         Let's get this over with.

               Boss Man walks up naked, except for red cowboy boots.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I love a woman with enthusiasm.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo walks to the middle of the room.

                                     BOZO
                         I got two hundred bucks says none of 
                         you can beat me!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey! Get quiet or get out.

                                     BOZO
                         C'mon guys --

               P.O.V. - Hurtling toward the double doors and --

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     BOZO
                         Gimme some ACTION --

               BOOM! The double doors to the bar are kicked open by HERO 
               (30s, rugged alpha man built to kick ass).

               KRASH! Belle DROPS a second tray of drinks --

               MUSIC CUTS OUT

               Hero is scraped, bruised and bloodied. He is dressed in blue 
               denim and holds a RUST-RED SHOTGUN and GUNNY SACK.

               He SLAMS the double doors shut and props a chair against the 
               handles, securing them.

                                     HERO
                         Unless you people want to die you'll 
                         do what I say and you'll do it fast!

               Bartender cocks his SHOTGUN.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You hold it right there, mister.

                                     HERO
                         A storm of hell's coming down on 
                         this place any minute!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Drop the canon!

               Hero puts down the shotgun and moves towards Bartender.

                                     HERO
                         I'm not armed now, just hear me out.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'll drop you and not even think 
                         about it!

                                     HERO
                         Let me explain!

                                     BARTENDER
                         You got one second to --

               Hero reveals a drool-dripping, white, GRANDPA BEAST HEAD 
               from the gunny sack and holds it out and for all to see.

                                     HERO
                         Take a good look and listen to me! 
                         There's at least a four of these 
                         things out there!

               Grandpa Beast's head has large red eyeballs and a mouth full 
               of jagged, ivory white teeth. It is like an albino jackal 
               head with spiked hair.

                                     HERO
                         I saw one of them tear up five men 
                         like they were corn on the cob!
                              (off silence, shock)
                         I don't know what they are. I don't 
                         know where they came from. All I do 
                         know is that these fuckers are fast, 
                         nasty, and hungry.

               The bar stares at him, slack-jawed.

                                     HERO
                         And they can fly. Not to mention 
                         they got claws like Ginsu knifes and 
                         more teeth than a chainsaw.

               The Bartender lowers his shotgun slightly. Fast as a snake, 
               Hero GRABS it. He notices the engraving, "THE JUDGE."

                                     HERO
                         They're like goddamn blood hungry 
                         biker tattoos come to life. They're 
                         clocking us. Right now. And we have 
                         to lock this bar down!
                              (moving around)
                         That means doors, windows, drains, 
                         and basements. We have to do it fast!

               Hero looks out the lone front window.

                                     HERO
                              (looks to Belle)
                         You! Get on that phone. Call the 
                         cops, National Guard, townies, whoever 
                         kicks ass and get 'em out here.

               Belle moves to a pay phone at the end of the bar.

                                     HERO
                         Any questions?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who are you?

                                     HERO
                         I'm the hero --

               CRASH! A white Beast arms BURSTS through the window and SPLITS 
               Hero right down the middle. The Judge FIRES into the ceiling --

               SECOND FLOOR

               The Judge's blast blows a toe off Boss Man's RIGHT FOOT as 
               he reaches climax with Tuffy. Boss Man HOLLERS.

               MAIN BAR

               Hero's right half is JERKED outside through the window.

               Blood sprays. Rapid chomping. CRASH! The double doors are 
               kicked open, splintering the propped up chair.

               HEROINE (Native American, rugged, ripped pants, wickedly 
               hot) rushes in, slams the doors shut and instinctively kicks 
               up the RUST RED SHOTGUN. She flips it sideways and slides 
               the metal weapon through the handles of the double doors, 
               securing them.

               BAM! A massive HIT slams into the doors from the outside 
               sending Heroine SLIDING across the floor.

               She SPRINGS to her feet and drives her weight into a table 
               attempting to hoist it over the now open window.

                                     HEROINE
                         HELP ME! SOMEBODY!

               Old Vet and Harley Mom rush to Heroine's aid. They raise the 
               table to cover the gaping hole. Heroine looks outside.

                                     HEROINE
                         GET DOWN!

               A BEAST nails the rising table, just missing Heroine's face.

               The table falls, pinning Heroine.

               JUNIOR BEAST enters. He's small and too fast to see well.

               He SWIPES the heads off Old Vet and Harley Mom. Bartender 
               grabs The Judge, but he's SCRATCHED down the back.

               Junior Beast rips out the pay phone. Knocks over the TV.

               Yanks out half of Trampy's hair.

               Edgy Cat CHARGES the spastic monster with a stool.

                                     EDGY CAT
                         I got you!

               Edgy Cat misses. Junior Beast sends him FLYING into a wall.

               BLAM! BLAM! Bartender FIRES The Judge at the creature hitting 
               lights instead. An errant shot destroys Edgy Cat's face.

               Para covers as Junior Beast RIPS the back of his wheelchair.

               Roadie WHACKS Junior Beast with a chair. Stunned, it flies 
               across the room, landing in a metal ICE COOLER.

               Bozo SLAMS it closed, capturing Junior Beast.

                                     BOZO
                         Got 'cha!

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Shadows of THREE SHRIEKING BEASTS close in on the window...

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bartender runs across the bar and SLAMS shut the thick wood 
               shutters. The Beasts HIT, cracking the middle.

               Roadie power lifts the table with Heroine and braces it 
               against the window for reinforcement, but a FURRY ARM busts 
               through and grabs the other half of Hero.

                                     HEROINE
                         Goddamn you!

               Blood starts to SPRAY from outside as the rest of Hero is 
               being devoured through the smallish hole.

               Heroine works a GOLD RING off of Hero's ring finger. The 
               feeding MOMMA BEAST'S head breaks in through the hole. It 
               grabs Heroine's left forearm.

               Bartender aims The Judge at the Beast...

                                     ROADIE
                         You'll hit her!

               Roadie KNOCKS The Judge up -- BLAM!

               SECOND FLOOR

               The Judge's shotgun blast blows off another toe on Boss Man's 
               RIGHT FOOT. He cries out in agony. 

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine spins and buries a splintered piece of the broken 
               chair into the ATTACKING MOMMA BEAST'S RIGHT EYE. The Beast 
               SCREECHES and jerks back, dragging the rest of Hero outside.

               Heroine clutches the ring. Shrieks and flapping wings are 
               heard outside. They dissipate. A moment of calm.

               Belle timidly holds the receiver of the busted pay phone.

               The other patrons emerge from under tables and other hiding 
               spaces in various states of shock. Junior Beast has 
               momentarily stopped moving. Bozo secures the lid with a nearby 
               PADLOCK.

                                     BOZO
                         What the FUCK was that?

               Wild-eyed and with a trembling hand, Heroine pours herself a 
               shot from the bar. She downs it and takes a long breath.

                                     HEROINE
                         The jungle has a new king.

               Freeze on her.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               There is a HOLLER at the top of the stairs. Everyone turns.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Is it clear?!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Yeah.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Is there a gun pointing at you?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Nah, I got the gun.

               Boss Man hobbles down the stairs with the help of Tuffy. His 
               foot is a bloody mess. He is holding a .38.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Alright goddamn it! Who shot me!? 
                         Who did it!?

               Belle and Bartender move to his aid.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         My goddamn foot is gone! Who fuckin' 
                         shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?

                                     BARTENDER
                              (motioning to Heroine)
                         Her fella.

                                     HEROINE
                         My husband...

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?

                                     HEROINE
                         He's dead.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What?
                              (noticing destruction)
                         What the hell happened down here?!

               Boss Man looks to Bozo.

                                     BOZO
                         I didn't do it! It was fuckin' 
                         monsters, asshole!

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Jesus Christ on the cross... someone 
                         make sense.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy. We're surrounded by something 
                         the likes none of you have ever seen 
                         before. Some kind of animals. Real 
                         fast, volatile, predators. One went 
                         through three of your patrons like 
                         nothing.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         So, your dead hubby shot me twice, 
                         three of my customers have been eaten, 
                         and there are angry creatures outside?

                                     HEROINE
                         He only shot you once.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Huh?

                                     HEROINE
                              (re: Bartender)
                         He shot you the other time.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It was an accident. Sorry.

               Boss Man squints skeptically. Adulterer points to GRANDPA 
               BEAST'S HEAD on the bar.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Look at it!

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fan-fuckin-tastic.

                                     TUFFY
                         My god... what is that?

                                     HEROINE
                         That's one piece of four problems.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Please elaborate.

                                     HEROINE
                         That head over there, that's the 
                         oldest of the bunch, looked like the 
                         Grandpa. We caught the little one, 
                         Junior, in the cooler there. As we've 
                         seen, what he lacks in size he more 
                         than makes up for in speed.

                                     BARTENDER
                         And the rest of 'em?

                                     HEROINE
                         Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are 
                         still outside.

               NOTE: As Heroine describes each beast, we see a slight glimpse 
               of their virtues, hidden mainly by shadows and fog.

                                     HEROINE
                         The next one is taller, but all out 
                         of proportion. Like a "teen beast."

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               TEEN BEAST has a big head and awkward body. He clumsily moves 
               and seems uncomfortable in his own skin.

                                     HEROINE (V.O.)
                         He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly 
                         just the same.

               INT. BAR FRONT -- NIGHT

               Heroine tends to her scratched arm.

                                     HEROINE
                         I just took the eye out of the mother. 
                         She calculates, guiding the attacks.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               MOMMA BEAST flashes out from the dark. She's shorter than 
               Teen, but much wider. She has a big mouth and NATIONAL 
               GEOGRAPHIC BOOBS that hang down to her waist. She covers her 
               stabbed right eye and SCREECHES.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine taps her right eye.

                                     HEROINE
                         If you are face to face with her, 
                         dive left.

                                     ROADIE
                         And the last one is the --

                                     HEROINE
                         Father. The biggest, the strongest...

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- NIGHT

               A blur of muscles, bloody fur, and teeth.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The entire bar stares at Heroine with their mouths agape.

                                     HEROINE
                         No sign of any weaknesses. No sign 
                         at all. He's an eating machine.

                                     COACH
                         Of all the friggin' bars to be stuck 
                         in.

                                     HEROINE
                         That's not it. Four are here, but 
                         there's three others... which I can't 
                         account for.

               Heroine eyes the room.

                                     HEROINE
                         We need to lock this place down. Is 
                         everyone in this room?

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh my god! My son! My SON!

               Tuffy races toward the staircase to the SECOND FLOOR.

                                     HEROINE
                         Wait!

               Tuffy is halfway up the stairs.

                                     TUFFY
                         Cody! Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming!

                                     HEROINE
                         Stop her!

                                     BARTENDER
                         Hey!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Tuffy BURSTS through the door. Cody sits by the TV, unmoved. 

                                     CODY
                         Mommy --

               Tuffy pulls Cody into her arms. Heroine and Bartender halt 
               to guard the doorway. Heroine spots a SMALL PORTAL WINDOW.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? 
                         Mommy is never gonna let you go!

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's lock off this room.

                                     TUFFY
                              (moving to exit)
                         Never, ever, never. Never, ever, 
                         never, baby. I love you --

               SMASH! Papa Beast BURSTS through the portal window and RIPS 
               Cody's torso from Tuffy's grasp. Tuffy holds his DANGLING 
               ARMS. Blood sprays everywhere.

                                     TUFFY
                         NOOOOOOOO!

               Papa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy! Bartender SHOOTS, nailing Papa 
               Beast. He hisses, but can't fit through the small window.

               Bartender aims again for a kill shot, but Papa Beast 
               projectile vomits Cody's remains at Bartender.

               Papa Beast retracts out the portal window. Heroine SLAMS the 
               wood shutters closed.

               Tuffy drops Cody's arms. Bug-eyed. She moves, zombie-like, 
               to the staircase. Bartender follows, covered in Papa Beast's 
               bile. Heroine locks the staircase door shut.

                                     HEROINE
                         Damn it.

               MAIN BAR

               Beer Guy stares at the bile covered Bartender.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Oh god...

               He hands him a towel. Tuffy slowly walks towards the rest of 
               the patrons. The blood on her face and chest tells them what 
               happened. The horror hits home.

               Heroine eyes the destroyed phone.

                                     COACH
                              (to Tuffy)
                         Are you --

               Heroine puts a hand up to silence Coach.

                                     HEROINE
                         Just let her be... please.
                              (beat)
                         Is that the only phone?

               Bartender emerges from the back holding a mess of plastic 
               and wires.

                                     BARTENDER
                         The back phone is wrecked, too.

               Trampy's eyes light up and she digs through her purse.

                                     BELLE
                         This is really happening. I can't 
                         believe this is really happening.

               Grandpa and Grandma have calmly re-taken their seats.

                                     GRANDPA
                         What'd you say?

                                     GRANDMA
                         I didn't say anything.

               Bartender hesitantly tosses a wash towel over the Grandpa 
               Beast head at the end of the bar.

               Para is awkwardly trying to fix the back of his wheelchair.

               Belle moves over to help and sees a mess of wires coming 
               from the wheelchair's back rest.

                                     PARA
                         Thank you, but I don't need any help --

                                     BELLE
                         What's this? A power magnet or 
                         something?

                                     PARA
                         No. It's nothing.

               Belle puts together his scam with a smirk.

                                     BELLE
                         I didn't peg you for a con man.

                                     PARA
                         Hey, it pays more than the couch.

                                     BELLE
                         Lots of stuff around here does.

               Trampy pulls out a CELLULAR PHONE from her purse.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Here!

               The group looks over. Adulterer GRABS it.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Hey!

                                     ADULTERER
                         Back off!

               Beer Guy walks from behind the bar.

                                     BEER GUY
                         So, what now? Did those things leave?

                                     BOZO
                         Why don't you go check it out?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Fuck no.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (into cell phone)
                         I have a signal! I have -- Diane? 
                         Diane listen to me... get the kids 
                         and get in the basement... do it 
                         right now...

               Trampy stares with grief in her eyes.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'll explain later. Not now! I'm at 
                         a bar... look... shut up! JUST SHUT 
                         UP AND GET IN THE FUCKING BASEMENT, 
                         DIANE! Diane! Diane?... Hello? Damn 
                         it! I lost the signal!

               Adulterer looks at the phone a bit dazed.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Okay. Okay. Look now, I gotta get 
                         outta here! I gotta go! My wife... 
                         See my wife is alone... She could be 
                         in trouble. I GOTTA GO!

               He moves towards the front door. Heroine moves into his path.

                                     HEROINE
                         I wouldn't do that.

               Adulterer, violently grabs Heroine to shove her away.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Fuck you, bitch!

               Heroine nails Adulterer with THREE HITS to the chin, throat 
               and chest, flipping him to the floor. She pulls a KNIFE from 
               her belt buckle and has it under Adulterer's chin.

                                     HEROINE
                         You can risk your life, but not mine! 
                         My daughter's no more than twenty 
                         miles from here waiting for me. I 
                         have just as much reason to leave 
                         this place as you do. But I also 
                         know that if they're here, then 
                         they're not there yet.

               Adulterer squirms.

                                     HEROINE
                         You understand me?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Get the fuck off...

                                     HEROINE
                         You understand me!?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Yes!

                                     HEROINE
                         Now pull that tough boy shit again 
                         and I'll slice you from neck to nuts!

               Adulterer nods obediently. Heroine removes the knife from 
               his neck and plants it back into her buckle.

                                     ADULTERER
                         You can't keep me here. This is 
                         bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is 
                         fucking BULLSHIT!

                                     HEROINE
                         We can't risk letting them in.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (trembling, pissed)
                         Right.

               Adulterer takes his seat. He looks over at the half bald 
               Trampy. She looks at him, hurt.

               At the bar, Bozo puts the TV back into place, he jiggles 
               with some wires in the back, bringing back the picture.

                                     BOZO
                         Anything?

                                     PARA
                         Yeah, you got it.

               The bar takes notice. Trampy, cell phone in hand, paws through 
               a phone book as she watches the broadcast.

                                     BELLE
                         See! This has to be isolated. That's 
                         a local broadcast.

               ON TV: The Newscaster reads the teleprompter.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         And now, we head to our man on the 
                         scene with a live look at tomorrow's 
                         event in Red Mountain.

               Heroine eagerly looks on, moving closer to the TV.

                                     HEROINE
                         My daughter's in Red Mountain.

               ON TV: There is an awkward pause from the Newscaster. The 
               broadcast doesn't cut to the reporter.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Can you hear us? Apparently we're 
                         having some technical difficulties...

               Heroine sinks in her skin.

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh no.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Oh, there we go!

               ON TV: A REPORTER, in an even worse suit, stands in a field 
               with several people looking through telescopes.

                                     REPORTER
                         That's right, the crowds are lining 
                         up early to witness tomorrow's 
                         meteorological phenomenon.

               Heroine sighs a gust of relief.

                                     REPORTER
                         But always remember, don't look 
                         straight into the sun because a 
                         special filter is needed to avoid 
                         damaging your cornea.

               The Reporter beams.

                                     REPORTER
                         And we're all looking forward to it 
                         tomorrow. Back to you.

               In the studio, the Newscaster smirks.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         Thank you. And in other news...

               Roadie points to the TV.

                                     ROADIE
                         That studio's local, we can call in.

                         I have a short wave radio upstairs.

               Trampy is already dialing on the cell.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I'm calling them... it's ringing!

                                     ROADIE
                         They'd have a police scanner.

                                     TRAMPY
                              (into cell)
                         Hello? Yes, we're at the United --

               ON TV: the Newscaster continues his routine.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         ...it has been reported that the 
                         power outage --

               A Beast arm REACHES in and TEARS off Newscaster's jaw. The 
               bar gasps in horror as his blood sprays. ZAP! The broadcast 
               cuts out, turning to static.

               Trampy screams and DROPS the cell, SHATTERING on impact.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Oh no! Oh fucking no!

               Heroine, tense, quells the rising panic.

                                     HEROINE
                         Keep it together! I came from the 
                         east. That studio is south of here. 
                         For all we know, north and west are 
                         okay.

                                     ROADIE
                         An associate of mine was coming in 
                         from the north, ain't heard a word 
                         from him in hours.

                                     HEROINE
                         So, that leaves the west.

               Tuffy looks up from a booth, clearing her throat.

                                     TUFFY
                         And Red Mountain. Your daughter.

               Heroine looks over, making eye contact.

                                     HEROINE
                         Right.

                                     BEER GUY
                         This is goddamn depressing.

               At the door, Heroine slides a thick metal pole through the 
               double door handles and takes out the Rust Red shotgun.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I've got some tools and extra planks 
                         in the kitchen, if we're on the same 
                         page here.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's work.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               The last board is hammered into place as the survivors back 
               away from the now re-enforced bar.

                                     BARTENDER
                         We'll it ain't pretty...

                                     BOSS MAN
                         But its got teeth.

               BAM-BAM-BAM! Junior Beast bangs around in the ice cooler.

                                     BOZO
                         I think it's hungry again.

                                     HEROINE
                         We have to kill it.
                              (to Boss Man)
                         Can you help?

               Boss Man hobbles over to the cooler and aims his .38. Junior 
               Beast goes wild, trying to get out.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fire in the hole!

               Bullets rip through the cooler. Junior squeals. More shots.

               Casings hit the ground. Smoke rises. Bozo leans in.

                                     BOZO
                         I think we got --

               RAH! A tiny white arm fires out from the cooler GRABBING 
               Bozo's leg. Bozo yelps.

               Moving quick, Tuffy grabs The Judge from Bartender and shoves 
               the barrel into a hole.

               BLAM! Guts splatter. Bozo falls back unscathed. He catches 
               his breath and looks to Tuffy. She is born again, seething.

                                     TUFFY
                         You're welcome.

               She hands the shotgun back to Bartender.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Jesus, it took all that? All those 
                         bullets? How can we possibly fight 
                         off the others?

                                     HEROINE
                         Aim for their orifices. Eyes, ears 
                         and mouth. From what I've seen, it's 
                         their only weakness.

                                     ROADIE
                              (looking at the corpse)
                         Looks like they're soft on the inside 
                         like any other animal. Trick is to 
                         get in there and do the damage.

                                     BELLE
                         Maybe we don't have to fight them.

                                     BOZO
                         Right, let's just call 'em names.

               Coach steps forward, poised to make the sale.

                                     COACH
                         Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have 
                         your attention.

               The bar skeptically eyes the large, sweaty Greek man.

                                     COACH
                         We have to think outside the box 
                         here. We don't need to fight them, 
                         we need to scare them. Scare them 
                         right back. This is a species stand-
                         off. We just need to show them we're 
                         not vulnerable. That we're formidable.

                                     ADULTERER
                         How?

                                     COACH
                         I need a stick.

               Bartender opens the cooler's lid and carefully pulls out 
               Junior Beast with salad tongs. It falls to the floor with a 
               SPLAT. Coach grabs a splintered broomstick.

                                     COACH
                         Stand back.

               He buries the broomstick into Junior's side and carries the 
               limp carcass towards a covered hole in the wall.

                                     COACH
                         Let's get that board down.

               Roadie pries off a board to reveal a pumpkin sized hole. 

                                     HEROINE
                         What are you doing?

               Coach shoves Junior's mangled body through to the outside.

                                     COACH
                         Showing superiority. The scent of 
                         their dead may drive them away.

               The whole bar moves to the side wall to see how the Beast 
               family will react. They look through SMALL HOLES, barely 
               able to see anything.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I don't see them.

                                     COACH
                         Come on. Come onnnnnn.

                                     BELLE
                         Is there a call, or something?

                                     BOZO
                         See that you monkey fucks! That's 
                         what you get when you mess with us! 
                         Woman or man, I don't give a fuck! 
                         Shit don't make me gay because you'll 
                         be sucking my dick!

               Bozo's insult hangs in the air.

                                     PARA
                         Sweet...

               P.O.V - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               WHOOSH! Junior is swiped from the handmade pike.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Coach jerks back. The startled group tries to focus, but 
               it's too dark outside. With the moon as the only light, Father 
               Beast can barely be made out cradling his dead child.

               Silhouettes of the other family members slowly approach 
               Junior. Papa Beast is gentle and it's almost endearing.

                                     BEER GUY
                         It's working. I think it's working.

                                     COACH
                         You see? What I tell you?

               The whole group starts to ease. Then... Papa Beast HOLLERS.

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Papa Beast lets out a HORRID WAIL. The group jumps back, 
               covering their ears. Then, something really odd happens.  
               Momma tosses Junior in the air, opens her wide jaws and 
               SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Adulterer's eyes widen.

                         Oh dear...

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Papa Beast moves behind Momma Beast and grabs hold of her.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               A steady "thud-thud-thud" rhythm vibrates the bar. Grandpa's 
               drink starts to hop to edge of his table with the beats. The 
               group maneuvers to get a better look.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Oh... my... god.

                         What are they doing now?

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Yes, Momma Beast and Papa Beast are having MONSTER SEX.

                         Dude, they're humpin'!

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               Unlike humans, Papa Beast finishes and the birth cycle lasts 
               all of thirty seconds. Momma Beast's belly balloons up and 
               she squats. POP! A SLIMY OBJECT the size and shape of a vacuum 
               cleaner drops from her.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Trampy VOMITS.

               P.O.V. - THROUGH SMALL HOLES

               The slimy object SPLITS in half. The two halves spring 
               appendages and raise their heads. The TWIN SISTER BEASTS 
               have been born.

               Papa moves forward and cleans off his new baby girls. The 
               Beast Girls look at the bar and hiss in unison.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine's eyes bulge.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get back!

               SLAM-SLAM! The two hissing Beast Girls strike the bar front.

               Roadie shoves that board back over the hole. Beer Guy is 
               holding back the still heaving Trampy's hair.

                                     BOZO
                         Any more ideas, Animal Planet?

                         I-I-I was just being proactive...

                                     BOZO
                         Go douche.

                         We're stuck in here. That's what.

               Bozo pops open a beer off the back of Para's wheelchair.

               Roadie nods to Grandpapa Beast's head on the end of the bar.

                         hours ago...

               The orange sun melts into the horizon.

               INT. FARMHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               Hero and his overweight friend TUBBS (35, hard living career 
               farm hand) laugh at a TV show while Heroine paces on the 
               telephone in the background.

                                     HEROINE
                              (into phone)
                         So, how is staying with Grandma 
                         working out? Ya know, if you stare 
                         into her glasses, you can see what 
                         cards she is holding. But I didn't 
                         tell you that.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- CONTINUOUS

               There's a home on the horizon with a big barn next to it.

               Shrieking and flapping grows in the distance.

               INT. FARMHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine starts to peek out of the window.

                                     HEROINE
                         Mommy will pick you up tomorrow night, 
                         okay baby?

               The phone cuts out.

                                     HEROINE
                         Hello? Charlie?

               Heroine and Hero look at each other with concern. Hero looks 
               out the window.

                                     HERO

                         We barricaded ourselves in the cellar. 
                         Then it was just listening. We heard 
                         those things destroy an entire heard 
                         of livestock. They just kept coming. 
                         Closer and closer, consuming anything 
                         in the way. Slashing, feeding and 
                         licking the bones clean. Just when 
                         we said our prayers, the first ray 
                         of sun hit the house...

               EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING

               PLOP! A HORSE'S HEAD falls as Heroine and her companions 
               peek out from the damaged cellar door.

                         That first beam of sunlight drove 
                         'em away. Somewhere. We called who 
                         we could and then decided to run for 
                         it. We didn't see a soul the whole 
                         drive out. When the tank went dry, 
                         we came upon a gas station to refill.

               EXT. PRAIRIE LAND -- LATE DAY

               The sun is falling into the horizon. The traveler's CAMARO 
               pulls into a small gas station

               EXT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine goes up to the service window with Tubbs and looks 
               inside. Nobody. There is a slight BUZZING from inside.

               Hero hollers from the fuel pump by the car.

                                     HERO
                         What's goin' on? The pumps are off.

                         There's nobody here --

               She follows the buzzing sound to a corner of the room. There 
               is a swarm of black flies crawling over half a STATION 
               ATTENDANT'S gutted torso.

                                     HEROINE

               Glass shatters as Heroine reaches inside to turn on the pumps.

                         enough fuel to make it through the

               Heroine and Tubbs hastily grabs food and drinks, ignoring 
               the cash register completely. The sun is setting.

               EXT. GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

               Hero turns as a shrill HISSING comes from the shadows...

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         It happened fast...

               EXT. GAS STATION -- LATE DAY

               Heroine and Tubbs emerge from the gas station shop.

                                     HERO
                         Move it!

               Heroine and Tubbs hear the growing cries of the Beasts.

               Their loot hits the pavement as they run.

                                     HERO
                         Get in the car, baby.

               Hero drops the spilling gas nozzle. Tubbs slides into the 
               back as Heroine jumps into the driver's seat.

               Hero runs over the top of the Camaro and slides into the 
               sunroof. He grabs a rifle and aims toward the leaking gas 
               pool. Something rises in the gas station.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                                     HEROINE
                         That's when I saw three others... 
                         just for a second.

               EXT. GAS STATION -- SUNSET

               Three lean, muscular shapes rise from the shadows.

                                     HERO
                         Roll!

               Heroine fires up the car and tears out. Hero shoots and the 
               station becomes a FIREBALL.

               INT. CAMARO -- CONTINUOUS

                                     HEROINE
                         Close the roof!

               Hero lowers into the back seat and starts to close the roof 
               as STRIPPED COUSIN BEAST lands on top of the car...

                                     HERO
                         Shit!

               Stripped Cousin Beast PUNCHES through the back window, 
               reaching for them. Heroine jerks the wheel.

               The car 180's and the Beast sails off of the car into 
               darkness. The Camaro tears down a tangent dirt road.

                                     HERO
                         We made it!

               Hero reaches back to give a "five" to Tubbs. Tubbs doesn't 
               respond. Heroine is the first to see Tubbs' quivering, 
               HEADLESS body in the back seat.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Heroine stands near Grandpa Beast's head.

                                     HEROINE
                         It must have smelled the blood or 
                         something. We buried the body and 
                         got back on the main road when...

               INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT

               BOOM! Grandpa Beast LANDS on the front hood of the Camaro.

               Heroine and Hero SCREAM and rev the engine, swerving madly 
               as Grandpa Beast VOMITS on the windshield.

                                     HERO
                         Break!

               Heroine slams on the breaks. Grandpa Beast slides back, 
               holding onto the grill.

                                     HERO
                         Go! Go! Go!

               Grandpa Beast tears into the engine through the grill as 
               sparks and smoke shoot out. Heroine jerks the steering wheel.

                                     HERO
                         Look out!

                         And the head?

               INT. CAMARO -- NIGHT

               The car crashes into a ditch, DECAPITATING Grandpa Beast.

               His head FIRES through the windshield, landing on Heroine's 
               lap. Its snake-like tongue lashes out at Heroine's crotch.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

                         So, your husband ditched you?

                         No. It was wild out there. No time 
                         to think. We just moved. He didn't 
                         leave me. He just ran.

               Para wheels over to a COUNTY MAP on the side wall.

               Para stares intently at the map. Adulterer moves over to the 
               window that has shutters over it, peeking through a hole.

                         few days to feed. This could just be 
                         a part of their life cycle.

                                     HEROINE
                         Now, does everyone agree that they 
                         are still out there?

               The group nods.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Bozo)
                         'Eh, Chief?

                                     BOZO
                         ...Duh.

               Trampy holds Adulterer's wounded head.

                                     TRAMPY
                         He's out cold.

                                     BELLE
                         I know some first aid if we have a 
                         kit. Do we?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         In the kitchen, under the sink.

                                     HEROINE
                         No one goes anywhere alone. Least of 
                         all, unarmed.

                                     TUFFY
                              (to Coach)
                         There's some sweats in my bag behind 
                         the bar.

                                     COACH
                         Thanks.

               Coach heads to the bar. Roadie moves to the map near Para.

                                     ROADIE
                         You're a clever man.
                              (re: Bozo)
                         Why do you take shit from him?

                                     PARA
                         Yeah, he's an ass, but he's my 
                         brother. Que sera-sera.

                                     ROADIE
                         Your brother, huh?

                                     PARA
                         Yep.

                                     ROADIE
                         Same parents?

                                     PARA
                         Look man, I read books. He reads 
                         bumper stickers.

               Roadie nods. Heroine jerks a bottle of booze from Beer Guy 
               and tosses it out.

                                     HEROINE
                         Alright, we need to stay alert and 
                         for everyone to take a role.
                              (to Boss Man)
                         You gotta have some guns or weapons 
                         around here.

               Boss Man, pale and morphine pumped, sits at a table with his 
               foot raised.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I got my .38 here. That's six shots 
                         and two refills. Downstairs, I have 
                         locker with a sawed-off and some 
                         gardening tools. Maybe a few boxes 
                         of shells.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I got shells, too. Box and a half 
                         tops. Machete behind the bar.

                                     HEROINE
                         Okay, well that's something.

                                     ROADIE
                         So we've got guns, kitchen knives, 
                         pipes, fire and sticks.

               Beer Guy scans the stocked bar wall.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I might be able to do something with 
                         the bottles.

                                     GRANDPA
                         You're gonna need a whole lot more 
                         than that to get outta here alive.

               The crowd turns to face Grandpa and his wife.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh, now you have something to say?

               Grandpa holds on to Grandma's hand as he speaks.

                                     GRANDPA
                         You young'uns worry about weapons, 
                         I'm thinkin' 'bout strategy.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh? And what's that?

                                     GRANDPA
                         Sit still, look less like a meal.

                                     BOZO
                         That's for bears and sharks, chunky 
                         chew.

               The group looks back to Heroine.

                                     HEROINE
                         Alright, what else do we have? Can 
                         we somehow contact the outside world?

               Trampy pensively stays on her fractured phone.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I can't get anybody. I don't even 
                         know if I have a signal anymore.

                                     BEER GUY
                         I have a CB in my truck, we could 
                         get some help out here.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Who the hell would you call?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Anyone.

                                     BOZO
                         Do you drive a short beer bus or 
                         something? You go out there, you get 
                         eaten. You stay in here, you get 
                         eaten. Anyone comes to help, they 
                         get eaten. Don't you see a pattern 
                         here, Spuds Makenzie?

                                     BEER GUY
                         Then I guess we should just give up.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: Trampy)
                         Believe me, I'd love to save the day 
                         and get some heroic snatch, but it's 
                         not in the cards, partner.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Boss Man)
                         You said you had a short wave radio.

                                     TRAMPY
                         Where?

                                     BARTENDER
                         Upstairs.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Go for it. It's by the far wall. 
                         Channel 9 is the emergency frequency.

                                     HEROINE
                         Good. I'm heading to the basement 
                         for supplies.
                              (to Bozo)
                         And you're going upstairs.

               Bozo blinks. A little taken aback.

                                     BOZO
                         Let's not get carried away...

                                     HEROINE
                         Step up, Chief.

                                     BOZO
                         So that's how it is?
                              (hands out)
                         Fine! Shotgun, please.

               Bartender hands him The Judge.

                                     BOZO
                              (to Bartender)
                         You're coming with, portly. 'Cause 
                         if I'm attacked, I want a fat man 
                         close by.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I'll wait by the door.

                                     BOZO
                         Now who else is comin'?

               No one budges.

                                     GRANDPA
                              (rising from his seat)
                         I'll go with ya.

                                     BOZO
                         What are you gonna do? Throw your 
                         teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.

               Bartender moves to the back of the bar, grabbing his machete.

               At the same moment, Coach emerges from behind the bar in 
               very snug, feminine-looking pink sweat pants.

                                     BOZO
                         You! Zorba! You're coming too!
                              (to Heroine)
                         Now gimme the keys.

               Heroine tosses the keys to Bartender.

                                     HEROINE
                         No. You're locked in.

                                     BOZO
                         What?

                                     HEROINE
                         Those two will be on the other side 
                         waiting for you. If you become food, 
                         I don't want the only set of keys in 
                         the belly of one of those things.

                                     BOZO
                         Don't get your hopes up.

               Bozo moves to the staircase. There's blood at the bottom and 
               it gets worse with each step. Bartender and Coach follow.

               Heroine turns to the bar.

                                     HEROINE
                         Any volunteers to head into the 
                         basement with me?

                                     TUFFY
                         I will.

               Tuffy stands, sniffling. She wipes the tears from her eyes, 
               looking tough and resolute.

                                     BEER GUY
                         That's not a good idea.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         With what happened upstairs --

                                     TUFFY
                         Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have 
                         no idea what is running through me 
                         right now. No idea.
                              (to Heroine)
                         I'm ready.

                                     HEROINE
                         Alright.

                                     ROADIE
                         Count me in.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Me too.

               Heroine, Tuffy, Roadie, and Beer Guy all move to the basement. 
               The door creaks open slowly. The group descends.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bozo slightly slips on the blood. He grips the railing and 
               pulls himself up the staircase like an old man.

                                     BOZO
                         Alright you two, I don't want to 
                         hear any of this, "oh, I dropped the 
                         key, wrong key, ain't no key here." 
                         When I want out, I want out, ok?

                                     BARTENDER
                              (displaying keys)
                         They're right here.

                                     COACH
                         We've got your back, bro.

               They unlock the door, swinging it open.

                                     BOZO
                         Just keep 'em handy, ladies.

               Bartender has the key in the thick dead bolt, ready to move.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo hustles in. The door shuts and locks.

                                     BOZO
                         Wish me luck...

               WHAM! Bozo is on the ground.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         I'm okay! I'm okay!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo rises and nervously surveys the damaged floor.

                                     BOZO
                         Come on. Come on. Come on.

               Bozo jumps when he sees the gore and the bloody shoes from 
               Cody's attack. The TV illuminates the room.

                                     BOZO
                         Geeezzzus.
                              (moving gingerly)
                         Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. 
                         Easy steps.

               MAIN BAR

               Belle kneels next to the Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         How are you holding up?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Well...

               He pulls a bottle out of his pocket and hands it to her.

                                     BELLE
                         What is this?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Morphine. My magic potion. I need a 
                         few drops.

               She puts a few drops on his out-stretched tongue.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You should try a little, it'll calm 
                         your nerves. Works like a charm.

                                     BELLE
                         No other time than now, right?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Wait, before you do that, help me 
                         move. There's a small room off the 
                         kitchen where I can lay down.

                                     BELLE
                         But --

                                     BOSS MAN
                         It's much safer in there. Trust me.

               BASEMENT

               The basement is dark, dingy and scattered with crap. Dried 
               out ANIMAL CARCASSES hang from the ceiling on hooks. A WINDOW 
               is open. Roadie slams it shut, eyeing the room, staring into 
               the dark corners.

                                     ROADIE
                         Stay on your toes everybody.

               Tuffy tightly grips her weapon, ready to fire. Heroine kneels 
               next to a hatch door that emits a red glow.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's this?

               Roadie jams a pipe into the little door, bracing it shut.

                                     ROADIE
                         You don't need to know what that is.

               Beer Guy finds the dusty locker and opens it.

                                     BEER GUY
                         There's a sawed-off shotgun in here.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender and Coach have their ears pressed to the door.

                                     COACH
                         Come on, bro.

               Behind them, through a boarded window, something CRAWLS 
               upward.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo moves turtle slow.

                                     BOZO
                         Lamaze. Lamaze. Lamaze.

               He moves to the Boss Man's private room. He puts his hand 
               out to open it. Trembling, he touches the knob and...

               CREEEEEEEEAK! The door eases open. Bozo steps inside the 
               room. He moves over to a lamp and pulls the chain. A bat 
               FLIES off the lamp shade SCREECHING. Bozo falls backwards.

                                     BOZO
                         HAAAA!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender and Coach jump back.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo gets off the floor again. He may have filled his pants.

                                     BOZO
                         Just a bat! I'm okay! Just a bat!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BARTENDER
                         If he doesn't shut up...

                                     COACH
                         He is human kabob.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               The room is like a converted pantry. Boss Man lies on a cot, 
               kissing Belle. A tiny wall fan spins providing ventilation.

               Belle pulls away and brushes back her long hair.

                                     BELLE
                         Doesn't your foot hurt?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I can't feel a thing, Hon.

                                     BELLE
                              (touching his crotch)
                         How 'bout now?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You're a bad girl, aren't you.

               Belle, a bit high, sways and starts to remove her clothes.

                                     BELLE
                         Um-hmmm.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         The girl's got rhythm.

               She takes off her blouse and tosses it at him. She then lifts 
               up her skirt and bends over, giggling.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         There it is.

               BASEMENT

               Roadie emerges with two crates. He dumps them on the floor.

                                     ROADIE
                         This is all junk.

               Beer Guy holds a rusted machete.

                                     BEER GUY
                         This could come in handy.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's get everything upstairs.

               Heroine moves to the stairs, but stops. She grabs Tuffy by 
               the arm and takes her aside.

                                     HEROINE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     TUFFY
                         Don't worry, I'm fine. Really.

                                     HEROINE
                         I admire your strength.

                                     TUFFY
                         Trust me, I plan on having a full 
                         breakdown when this is over, but for 
                         now, we all have to be strong, right?

               Heroine reaches into her shirt and pulls out an IDENTICAL 
               LOCKET as Tuffy's. She opens it and displays a picture of a 
               LITTLE GIRL.

                                     HEROINE
                         This is my daughter, Charlie. She's 
                         all I'm after.

                                     TUFFY
                              (fighting back tears)
                         Oh...

                                     HEROINE
                         And I'm gonna need your strength, 
                         every bit of it.

                                     TUFFY
                         You have it.

                                     HEROINE
                         Good. But still do me a favor.

                                     TUFFY
                         Name it.

                                     HEROINE
                              (with a wink)
                         Don't tell anyone I have a soft side.

                                     TUFFY
                              (tiny smile)
                         Deal.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo turns and points the gun around the room. He sees the 
               CB. It is like an intercom with a cable running outside. He 
               drops the shotgun and fidgets with the CB knobs.

                                     BOZO
                         Hello? Anyone there? We need help 
                         out here at the United Nations Tavern. 
                         Send guns, tanks, and all that shit. 
                         10-4. S.O.S.

               All he gets is static. A faint GROWL is heard outside. OUTSIDE 
               THE DOOR Bartender hears the growl, his eyes grow wide.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Belle rubs her hands over her rounded ass and flicks her 
               tongue at Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         You wanna see, baby?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Hell yeah.

                                     BELLE
                         How much you got?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         How much I got, what?

                                     BELLE
                         How much you got to see the show?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You don't understand, sweety. Daddy 
                         doesn't pay. Daddy sees the show for 
                         free. But you do get points for being 
                         horny on a night like this.

               She cringes and backs up a little.

                                     BELLE
                         What?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         You can't expect a man to buy a car 
                         without a test drive first, can you?

                                     BELLE
                         Um, hmm --

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Now wiggle that sweet little ass 
                         over here and sit on Daddy's face, I 
                         wanna do some appraising.

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo barks into the CB.

                                     BOZO
                         Repeat. We need help. SOS. Calling 
                         all cars! Calling all cars! We need 
                         help at the United Nations Tav --

               The CB is JERKED from Bozo's hands and slams into the wall.

                                     BOZO
                         Shit!

               Bozo aims the gun at the wall. Chewing sounds begin.

                                     BOZO
                         Double shit!

               He backs up to the door.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         Okay, I'm ready to come out now!

               Bartender confidently turns the key. CLICK! It breaks off in 
               the lock.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh!

                                     BOZO
                         "OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" 
                         mean?

               Bozo knocks on the door hard.

                                     BOZO
                         HEY! OPEN IT!!!

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Bartender looks to Coach.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Wha?

                                     BOZO
                         OPEN THE DOOR!!!

               A thunderous CRASH! Boards fly off the wall.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Belle, hearing the crash, jerks back from Boss Man.

                                     BELLE
                         What was that?

               CRASH! Sister Beast #1 and Sister Beast #2 punch through the 
               tiny wall fan and GRAB Belle by the scalp. She is JERKED 
               against the wall.

               She's slammed against it repeatedly and then -- RIP! Belle's 
               skin is TORN from her head and torso. Boss Man jumps back.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!!

               Belle falls into Boss Man's arms for a HIDEOUS KISS.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         NO! NO! NO!

               Boss Man shoves the bloody Belle back against the wall.

               Sister Beast #1 pokes her head inside the room, hissing. 

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine and the others, just returning from the basement, 
               hear the mayhem from upstairs and the kitchen.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Coach fumbles desperately with the jammed lock, trying to 
               use his fingernails to turn the metal stump.

                                     COACH
                         Great god, why do you damn me?!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo bangs on the door and looks over his shoulder at the 
               Momma and Papa Beast chomping at the wall.

                                     BOZO
                         GET ME OUTTA HERE!!!

                         Oh please, no.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Boss Man uses the cot to block the Sister Beasts from 
               entering. They hiss and shred the cot fabric.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         They're getting in! Somebody help!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Bozo kicks and punches the door.

                                     BOZO
                         HELP!!! GODDAMN IT!!!

               MAIN BAR

               Heroine charges up the staircase. Roadie rips the sawed-off 
               weapon from Beer Guy and runs for the kitchen.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

                                     BARTENDER
                         The key broke off!

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Coach)
                         Move it!

               Heroine rips the earring from Bartender's ear. He YELPS. She 
               jams the backing into the lock.

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Boss Man crawls for the door. Sister Beast #1 fires out a 
               whip-like tongue and snags Boss Man's damaged foot. He howls 
               in pain. Sister Beast #2 tongue-lasso's his other foot.

               OUTSIDE THE DOOR

               Heroine's picking fingers are bleeding from her effort.

                                     BOZO (O.S.)
                         HELP ME PLEASE!!!

               SMALL ROOM OFF KITCHEN

               Boss Man is pulled towards the Sister Beasts.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         HELLLLLP!!!

               Roadie kicks open the door and FIRES at the Sisters. They 
               dive back out of the room screeching.

               SECOND FLOOR

                                     BOZO
                         HELLLLLLLLP!!!

               Right behind Bozo, the boards fly off the portal window.

               Papa Beast flies at Bozo. Bozo spins and aimlessly FIRES his 
               shotgun, hitting Papa Beast directly in the groin.

               The door flies open. Bozo is YANKED to safety just as Papa 
               STRIKES the closing door.

               MAIN BAR

               The patrons track the wild CRASHING and HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING 
               sounds of Papa Beast. He finally breaks out of the upstairs. 
               Beer Guy and Roadie carry Boss Man into the room as Coach, 
               Bartender, Heroine and the shaken Bozo creep down the stairs.  
               Bozo slowly takes a seat in his brother's lap.

                                     PARA
                         I thought that was it for a second

                         What happened?

                                     BOZO
                         I got Papa in the stones.

                         That back room is sealed shut.

               Heroine glares at Boss Man.

                                     HEROINE
                         I told you to stay in the main room.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Yeah... I will. I will. Promise.

               Coach eyes the group, this is his time to shine.

                                     COACH
                              (rising, full of brawn)
                         If they can't reproduce anymore -- 
                         we are one step closer! A big step! 
                         Now is the time to band together. We 
                         need to rise up against these monsters 
                         of the night! Those creatures are no 
                         match for the human spirit! We can 
                         do it! We just need to believe in 
                         each other! In all of us! We need to 
                         make a stand! Right here! Right now!

               Long silence. Bozo stares.

                                     BOZO
                         Dude, are you gay?

               Coach sits down, humbled.

                                     HEROINE
                         We know what not to do. We must stay 
                         focused and together. The beasts 
                         will find a breach. We gotta find a 
                         way out before they find a way in.

                         Let's run for the cars, cause mass 
                         confusion.

                                     BARTENDER
                         The lot's too damn far, that's 
                         surefire suicide.

               The room is silent. Bartender motions to Boss Man, but he is 
               promptly shushed by Boss Man. Heroine notices.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Boss Man)
                         What?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         What?

                                     HEROINE
                         You know what.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         I don't know shit.

                                     HEROINE
                              (to Roadie)
                         You. What was that door downstairs?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Wait, wait, wait.

               Heroine glares at Roadie.

                                     HEROINE
                         Don't bullshit me.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It's a tunnel.

               Roadie nods, causing Boss Man to sigh.

                                     BARTENDER
                         It runs about a hundred yards and 
                         spits out on the backside of that 
                         hill down the way.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's it for?

               They clam up.

                                     HEROINE
                         What's it for!?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Grass, man. I grow pot down there.

                                     HEROINE
                         Does the tunnel spit out near a car?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         It spits out behind the parking lot.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         My truck is near, but it ain't nearly 
                         big enough to haul the whole lot.

                                     HEROINE
                         It's a shot. Is it gassed up?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Fully.

                                     HEROINE
                         Four door?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Two.

                                     HEROINE
                         How many can it hold?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Six.

                                     HEROINE
                         Max?

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Seven.

                                     HEROINE
                         It's gonna fit thirteen.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Thirteen clowns wouldn't fit.

                                     HEROINE
                              (with hand out)
                         Keys.

                         What're you planning?

                                     HEROINE
                         Three of us go. Two to defend, one 
                         to drive. We back up to the bar and 
                         then tear ass out of here.

                                     BOSS MAN
                         Sounds sketchy.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let me make this clear; if we stay, 
                         we die.

               Boss Man reluctantly pulls out some keys that are on a string 
               around his neck.

                                     ROADIE
                         Give 'em to me, I'm going.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You're trusting that con? He'll ditch 
                         us and never look back.

                                     ROADIE
                         Fuck you too.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Get in line!

                                     HEROINE
                         Hey! I'm not trusting him either, 
                         that's why I'm going with.

               Coach stands forward.

                                     COACH
                         "Courage is being scared to death, 
                         but saddling up anyway."
                              (off blank stares)
                         The Duke. I will go.

                                     HEROINE
                         This is it. They have this place 
                         surrounded, but if we go under them 
                         we might just make it.

                                     BARTENDER
                         This is a bottleneck waiting to 
                         happen.

               SMACK! Bozo SLAPS Coach's ass.

                                     BOZO
                         This one's great under pressure. I 
                         wish you luck.

                                     HEROINE
                         The rest of you prepare the weapons, 
                         whatever you got left. 'Cause when 
                         we crash through those walls, we're 
                         bringin' death with us.

               Heroine takes The Judge from Bartender and hands it to Coach.

                                     COACH
                         No, I don't believe in guns.

                                     BARTENDER
                         This ain't time for a political 
                         stance.

               Coach takes the rusty machete from Beer Guy.

                                     COACH
                         This doesn't run out of ammo.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Got ya.

               Heroine, Roadie, and Coach move to the basement.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey!

               The three look to Bozo, who offers a parting nod.

                                     BOZO
                         When you get to that truck... drive 
                         it like you stole it.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               At a booth, Trampy re-bandages Adulterer's eye.

                                     TRAMPY
                         How does it feel?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Lousy.

                                     TRAMPY
                         You still have one left.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Yes, the silver lining.

                                     TRAMPY
                         It serves you right for cheating.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Spare me.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I figure it's karma. You wronged me 
                         and you wronged your wife, so this 
                         is karma biting you on the ass, or 
                         in your case... in the eye.

               Bozo moves close, surveying the bandage work.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh yeah?

                                     TRAMPY
                         It could be worse, you could be dead. 
                         Then again, the climax is upon us.

                                     BOZO
                              (re: Trampy's hair)
                         Ya know, that's not a bad look on 
                         you. Kinda 1985, but not bad. I'd 
                         hook it up.

                                     TRAMPY
                         I wouldn't fuck you for practice.

                                     BOZO
                         Tease.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Leave her alone.

                                     BOZO
                         Hey, cyclops. Let's have a quiet 
                         contest... starting now.

               Bozo turns his attention back to Trampy.

                                     BOZO
                         Ya know, in situations of duress, I 
                         have found that women are attracted 
                         to my authority.

               INT. BAR -- BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine, Roadie, and Coach make their way through the 
               basement. Creeks and cracks with every step.

                                     ROADIE
                              (to Heroine)
                         You handle yourself pretty well. You 
                         a cop or a criminal?

                                     HEROINE
                         Neither. Just a farmer.

                                     ROADIE
                         Oh yeah? Then how do you do it?

                                     HEROINE
                         I just think about my husband and 
                         daughter... and the rest is easy.

               The light casts a shadow of something BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

               Roadie moves to open the curtain with his sawed-off barrel.

                                     HEROINE
                         Easy.

               WHIP! The curtain slides. It's a dried animal hide on a hook. 
               They all sigh. Roadie unblocks the tiny door.

               Heroine scans the room.

                                     ROADIE
                         This place is creepy in the daytime, 
                         too. Ready?

               Coach's hand shakes as he raises his weapon.

                                     ROADIE
                         Scared?

                                     COACH
                         No. You?

                                     ROADIE
                         Of course not. I fight monsters all 
                         the time.
                              (gripping the door)
                         On three.

               Roadie, Heroine raise their weapons.

                                     COACH
                         One... two... three!!!

               Roadie whips open the door. Nothing.

               BANG-GONG-GONG! Some pipes CRASH to the ground next to them... 
               they jump, but nothing is there. A LITTLE MOUSE emerges from 
               the fallen heap.

                                     COACH
                         Well, look at that.

               Coach leans down and puts out his hand. He smiles as Heroine 
               watches over his shoulder.

                                     COACH
                         Hey, little fella.

                                     HEROINE
                         Let's go.

               He leaves the mouse and follows Heroine to the tunnel.

               SLURP! A pink tongue LASSOS the mouse.

               A red fluorescent glow radiates from the tunnel. They all 
               drop in, one by one, entering the steamy, confined space.

                                     COACH
                         Looks like a brothel for plants.

                                     ROADIE
                         Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Tuffy stands by a far wall, looking through the planks for 
               movement. At the bar, Beer Guy makes MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.

               Bozo moves close, slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand.

                                     BOZO
                         Ah-ah-ah! You're doing that all wrong!

                                     BEER GUY
                         What do you know?

                                     BOZO
                         I know you're doing it wrong.

                                     BEER GUY
                         Prove it.

               Bozo grabs a cloth rag and moves to the alcohol bottles.

                                     BOZO
                         Move aside, princess.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               The tunnel is thin and no more than SIX FEET HIGH. Cherry 
               red fluorescent lights line the top of the tunnel and kneehigh 
               marijuana plants are along the ground soil. There are thick 
               pipes above the plants that work as a makeshift watering 
               system. There is about six inches of water on the floor.

                                     COACH
                              (to Roadie)
                         You and I are similar. We both have 
                         accents. We both travel a lot. We 
                         both don't really have homes...

                                     ROADIE
                         You should be quiet.

                                     COACH
                         I am sorry, I ramble when I'm nervous.

                                     HEROINE
                         Quiet.

               Coach bites his lip, dying to say something.

                                     COACH
                         It's just that this seems like the 
                         opportune time for someone to be 
                         horribly... offed.

                                     ROADIE
                         What did I say?

                                     COACH
                         Sorry. I'm done now.

               INT. BAR -- NIGHT

               Bozo stuffs the cloth rag into one of the bottles.

                                     BOZO
                         You don't want the rag touching booze, 
                         that way you can hold it and ensure 
                         it explodes when you throw it.

                                     PARA
                         You sure? I thought the rag had to 
                         touch?

                                     BOZO
                         I'm sure.

               Bozo finishes the Molotov cocktail and grabs a beer.

                                     BOZO
                         Perfecto. What we should do, though, 
                         is put those peanut barrels to use. 
                         Fill 'em with booze and line up some 
                         planks. If the walls come down... we 
                         hit 'em Donkey Kong style.

               Para and Beer Guy eye the three large peanut barrels, perfect 
               for bomb-making.

                                     PARA
                         Genius.

                                     BEER GUY
                         You aren't nearly as dumb as you 
                         look, are you?

                                     BOZO
                         Next time, look within. Stereotyping 
                         can be ugly and hurtful.

               Bozo looks to Trampy, putting an arm around her shoulder.

                                     BOZO
                         Excuse me for being forward, but I'm 
                         curious about your dimensions.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               Roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. The 
               tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down.

                                     ROADIE
                         Hold up. You hear something?

               A SCRATCHING sound is heard from above.

                                     ROADIE
                         They're trying to burrow through the 
                         tunnel walls.

                                     HEROINE
                         Move.

               The scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end 
               of the tunnel as well.

                                     COACH
                         Like moles these things.

               Then, Sister Beast #1 drops into the tunnel from the far 
               end.

               She charges. At the last second, Roadie spots her.

                                     ROADIE
                         Duck!

               Roadie and Coach duck into the water, but Heroine is unable 
               to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards. Sister 
               Beast #1 lands and turns, surveying her prey. Roadie aims 
               his water-dripping gun, but Heroine rises and blocks his 
               shot.

                                     ROADIE
                         Stay down!

               From her knees, Heroine fires. BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! The three 
               shots push Sister Beast #1 backwards. Heroine rises, covered 
               in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face.

                                     HEROINE
                         Go! The bitch is mine!

               Roadie and Coach reluctantly turn, leaving Heroine to fend 
               with the Beast.

               Heroine charges. Hissing, Sister Beast #1 charges as well.

               Heroine pumps and fires. BOOM! Sister Beast spins, avoiding 
               the shot. Now too close, Heroine jams the Beast in the mouth 
               with the gun, knocking her back.

               Sister Beast #1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm.

               Heroine bats her away. Sister Beast #1 moves to the others.

                                     HEROINE
                         Look out!

               Roadie and Coach sprint until Sister Beast #2 BURSTS through 
               the tunnel walls, stopping Roadie and Coach in their tracks.

               Roadie fires his weapon, but it sparks and fizzles.

                                     ROADIE
                         The shells are wet!

               With the two Beasts closing in. The men are trapped. Coach 
               looks around, seeing a plan.

                                     COACH
                         Grab onto ceiling and get out of 
                         water!

                                     ROADIE
                         What?

                                     COACH
                         Do it!!!

               Grabbing onto the piping along the ceiling, Roadie pulls 
               himself from the water. Coach uses the machete to cut a power 
               cord from above. He grabs the exposed, sparking end.

                                     COACH
                              (to Heroine)
                         Get out of water!!!

               Heroine sees what he's doing, sprints back the way they came.

               As the two Beasts charge, Coach pulls himself out of the 
               water by holding onto the above piping. He's forced to wait 
               for Heroine to get out of the water.

               The second she does, he jams the cord into the water.

               ZAP! The conductive water sizzles. Sister Beast #1 and Sister 
               Beast #2 lock up and crash. ELECTROCUTION. Sparks and smoke 
               rises from their cooked bodies.

               Roadie and Coach look to each other, victorious. They begin 
               shimmying along the piping to the end of the tunnel.

               INT. TUNNEL/BASEMENT -- NIGHT

               Heroine looks back at the two men. She turns and reenters 
               the basement.

               GAH! Teen Beast drops in front of her, whacking her to the 
               floor. Heroine slides across the floor, but jumps up quickly. 
               Teen Beast cautiously moves in for the kill.

               Heroine raises her weapon.

                                     HEROINE
                         You fuck with my family. 
                              (aiming shotgun)
                         I fuck right back!

               Click -- out of ammo!

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh shit.

               Heroine THROWS the shotgun at him and pulls out the MACHETE.

               She rolls left and swings. Teen Beast loses two fingers.

               She swings again but gets whacked to the floor.

               Heroine rolls with the hit, grabs her shotgun, and dives 
               into the KEG ELEVATOR.

               She slams closed the door as Teen Beast regains its composure 
               and lunges. BAM! It CRASHES against the door.

               INT. TUNNEL -- NIGHT

               Roadie and Coach crawl to the platform by the exit.

               The two men climb up the ladder leading to the ground above.

               At the top, Roadie pushes off the plywood covering. The two 
               men peer into the night and spot the TRUCK.

               INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

               Heroine wedges the door closed. The Beast continues to try 
               to get in. Heroine bangs the top of the small elevator...

               Beer Guy hits the button. The gears grind and start to pull 
               the elevator up to the main floor.

               INSIDE KEG ELEVATOR

               Heroine squirms as the elevator rises.

               As Teen Beast starts to tear at the base of the rising keg 
               elevator in the shaft, Heroine pounds and tears at the few 
               planks above her in the keg elevator.

               The elevator SHAKES. Heroine POUNDS a hole through the

               Teen Beast BITES through the floor board of the keg elevator.

               CLANGGG! The elevator stops. Heroine lurches and grabs the 
               greasy cables to stop her fall.

               SNAP!! The cable BREAKS. Heroine SOARS up the shaft. Teen 
               Beast is pulled down to the bottom. The keg elevator door 
               bursts open on impact.

               Boss Man sips a bottle, still hopped-up on morphine. He lazily 
               loads his pistol from a pool of bullets on his belly.

               SNAPPP!!! His head and legs SLAP together as the arm pulls 
               him through a small hole in the floor.

               The group jumps back. Blood rockets out. His body is pureed 
               down the tiny hole.

               CRASH! Teen Beast's arm reaches up and GRABS Para's 
               wheelchair, violently shaking it. Para FALLS to the floor.

               Teen Beast's arm grabs Para's leg...

               There's silence.

               Dead silence.

               Then, far is the distance, beyond the walls, a sound is heard. 
               It's screaming. And it's approaching. Rapidly. The survivors 
               maneuver to peek out the front walls.

               The survivors shake in sickened silence. From beyond the 
               walls, they can hear high-pitched SCREAMS.

               THUD! THUD! THUD! With every strike, a splattering of blood 
               spits through the planks of wood.

               THUD! THUD! THUD! With a final furious strike, a few wood 
               planks splinter. Papa Beast sticks in his head and hisses.

                                     BOZO
                         Bomb's away!!!

               From the bar, Beer Guy, Tuffy, and Adulterer release the 
               first peanut barrel. It's ablaze and sails straight for Papa 
               Beast. BLAM! It explodes, bursting open the wall and knocking 
               back Papa Beast. The wooden walls go up in flame.

               Para, on a side table, reaches out and grabs Boss Man's .38 
               from the floor.

               The second peanut barrel is released. It sails outside the 
               breach, but it doesn't explode. Nevertheless, the Beasts 
               stay far away.

               Teen Beast madly rips floor boards away, moving towards Para's 
               table. Teen Beast bursts through the floor, knocking Para to 
               the floor.

               Para crawls to his fallen wheelchair. Teen Beast spots him, 
               moves in to feed.

               Para points his seat back at the scattered .38 bullets and 
               flips the armrest switch. SNAP! The bullets jump to the power 
               magnet. Para yanks one free, loads the pistol and turns just 
               as Teen Beast strikes...

               POP! The shot hits Teen Beast in the eye, sending him back 
               down the hole in the floor.

               Heroine and Bartender move in. When Teen Beast sticks his 
               head out of the hole again, they thrust both their shotguns 
               into each ear.

                         Now!

               BLAM-BLAM! The two shots scatter head everywhere.

               The flames in the bar spread, catching the entire wall and 
               roof on fire.

               EXT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

               The second barrel comes to a stop a good distance from the 
               bar. Suddenly, the top is knocked off. Trampy sticks her 
               head out.

               Seeing no trouble, she emerges, dizzy as hell, and races for 
               the nearby BEER TRUCK.

               INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER

               Papa and Momma Beast both charge the bar. The third peanut 
               barrel is released. It sails for them, but they dive out of 
               the way.

               KABLOOM! It takes out the rest of the wall. Fire and smoke 
               fills the place.

               Adulterer douses Momma Beast with booze as Beer Guy nails 
               her with a lit Molotov cocktail.

               WHOOSH! Engulfed in flame, she bolts from the bar shrieking.

                              (to Bartender)
                         Help me!

               Heroine and Bartender rip the DEER HEAD from the wall and 
               charge Papa, pinning him against the wall with the antlers.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on!

               Bozo and Beer Guy dive into Papa's legs, holding them down.

               Tuffy picks up The Judge.

               WHAM! The shotgun butt knocks out Papa's front teeth. Tuffy 
               raises the weapon again, staring down at the monster that 
               killed her child, but Papa Beast gets an arm free to knock 
               away her fatal blow.

               Bartender wrenches Papa Beast's arm with all his might. With 
               her hair stuck in Papa Beast's claw, Tuffy is pulled face to 
               face with the beast. She squirms as he chomps at her, but 
               with no front teeth, he can't do immediate damage.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I can't hold him!!!

                                     HEROINE
                         Do something!!!

               Tuffy reaches back and shoves her fist into Papa Beast's 
               mouth, jamming it down his throat. He instantly gags, sucking 
               for air.

               Papa Beast struggles to get free, but the others hold tight.

               Papa Beast's body begins to quiver from a lack of oxygen.

               His eyes widen, face to face with Tuffy.

                                     TUFFY
                         CHOKE ON IT!!!

               With one last lunge, Papa Beast shakes, his life drifting 
               away. His eyes turn black as his body goes limp. Tuffy pulls 
               out her arm from his throat.

                                     BARTENDER
                         God...

                                     BOZO
                         I need to get your number.

               Tuffy shakes her wet arm dry. As the group pulls away, Papa 
               Beast is still pinned to the wall with the deer antlers dug 
               into the wood.

               Heroine turns to Grandma and Grandpa, offering a hand.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on, I'll help you.

                                     GRANDPA
                         No thank you, we're content.

                                     HEROINE
                         I'm not leaving anyone behind.

                                     GRANDMA
                         Maybe next time, dear.

               Heroine swallows and nods. HONK-HONK-HONK! Just outside the 
               breached wall, the beer truck pulls up.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The beer truck screeches to a halt. Trampy's at the wheel, 
               waving the group over. With the bar burning, a thick layer 
               of SMOKE blankets the entire area.

               The people amass at the opening, but Heroine stops them from 
               advancing. The group stares the dark night. Silent.

                                     HEROINE
                         She's still out here.

               Heroine eyes the truck, seeing something she likes.

                                     HEROINE
                         Stay put.

               She creeps out alone.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where are you... come on...

               Nothing. Just smoke. And silence.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on! Come on!

               From the smoke, a smoldering Momma Beast charges like a bull.

               At the truck, Heroine opens the back doors and dives in, 
               leaving the doors open. Momma Beast gives chase, entering 
               the back.

               INSIDE TRUCK

               Heroine is deep into the truck as Momma Beast enters. She 
               advances, hissing.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come and get me you blood-chugging 
                         CUNT!

               Momma howls and charges. Heroine slides out the side keg 
               door, locking it behind her. Before Momma can see the trap, 
               Beer Guy slam closed the rear doors.

               OUTSIDE TRUCK

               Beer Guy latches it. Trampy comes around the truck.

                                     TRAMPY
                         You got her? You got her!

                                     HEROINE
                         Not for long, we gotta burn it.

               Heroine looks to the others at the breach.

                                     HEROINE
                         Come on! Let's blow this thing!

               The others move into action. Beer Guy takes off his shirt 
               and shoves it into the fuel tank. Adulterer and Bozo, with 
               Para riding piggyback, help. They use the Molotov cocktails 
               to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck.

                                     BEER GUY
                         When this lights, run like hell.

               About fifteen yards away from the truck. Bozo throws his 
               silver-plated American Eagle lighter to Heroine.

                                     HEROINE
                              (catching lighter)
                         Here we go...

               Then, a noise: EOCH-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK!

               A deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck.

               It's Momma Beast. Again and again.

                                     TUFFY
                         What is that?

                                     HEROINE
                         She's calling for help.

               Heroine drops the lighter onto the fuel. It races for the 
               truck. When feet away, COUSIN BEAST lands, stomping out the 
               fire with his foot.

                                     BOZO
                         The fan has officially been buried 
                         in the shit.

               Instantly, another beast, AUNT BEAST, lands on the top of 
               the truck. These Beasts are like the others, but stripped. 
               The group gasps. Trampy backs away.

                                     TRAMPY
                         We have to run --

               BURST! Trampy's rib cage is ripped from her body. The culprit, 
               UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box 
               of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar. 
               From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma 
               Beast emerges.

                                     HEROINE
                         Get to your cars!!!

               The Beasts spring into action, chasing the group.

               Bozo, with Para on his back, sprints for his car. Aunt Beast 
               RIPS Para from Bozo's back.

                                     BOZO
                         Motherfucker! Give him back!

               Bozo runs for his Trans-Am. Para falls to the ground, still 
               alive. Bozo turns back and sees him.

                                     BOZO
                         Oh Jesus!

                                     PARA
                         HELLLPPP!

               Bozo grabs his brother and puts him on his back again, runs.

                                     BOZO
                         I thought we lost you --

               Para is RIPPED into the air again.

                                     BOZO
                         You FUCKER!

               Tuffy and Bartender jump into his PICKUP TRUCK.

                                     TUFFY
                              (to Heroine)
                         Get in!

               Heroine hops in the back.

               Beer Guy and Adulterer run to a car together. Beer Guy lags 
               behind, continually looking over his shoulder.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Run and quit looking back!

               As Beer Guy looks forward, Aunt Beast and Uncle Beast hit 
               him HIGH-AND-LOW, cutting him in half. Bozo makes it to his 
               Trans-Am.

                                     BOZO
                         DO IT!

               VAHVVVOOOMMMM! The car roars to life. He pushes in a tape.

               The "MIAMI VICE" theme song blares from the speakers.

                                     BOZO
                         Get me FUCK BIRDS!

               Bozo peels out. Aunt Beast lands right in his path.

                                     BOZO
                         No you don't!

               BAM! He SMACKS Aunt Beast head on, sending the creature's 
               disemboweled body sailing through the air.

                                     BOZO
                         VENGEANCE!

               Para DROPS from the sky, still ALIVE and panting. Cars are 
               moving everywhere.

                                     PARA
                         Oh Jesussss...

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The burning JUKEBOX plays a slow love song. Dancing and 
               holding each other, Grandpa smooches Grandma on the forehead.

                                     GRANDPA
                         We had a good run.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Para crawls along the ground, being ignored by the Beasts.

                                     PARA
                         HELP ME! HELP ME SOMEBODY!

               Bozo turns on his windshield wipers to clear off the blood 
               and guts. He spots Para.

                                     BOZO
                         Hang on!

               Para claws the ground.

                                     PARA
                         Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

               Bartender jerks the wheel of his car.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Oh shit!

               Para sees Bartender's approaching truck.

                                     PARA
                         NOOO!!!

               Para rolls right, just missing tires. Para yells for his 
               brother.

                                     PARA
                         COME ON! GODDAMN IT!

               Bozo's eyes bulge.

                                     BOZO
                         Brother!!!

               BAM! Para is SMEARED by Adulterer's car.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Shit!

               Bozo floors it.

                                     BOZO
                              (overly endearing)
                         I meant to tell you so much!

               The remaining cars maneuver to hit the open road.

               INT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Grandpa and Grandma hold each other tight. Uncle Beast enters, 
               moving to their table. It moves in for the kill.

               Grandpa kisses his wife gently.

                                     GRANDPA
                         Close your eyes, hon.

               The Beast OPENS its massive jaws and... CRASH! Bozo's car 
               DRIVES through the bar, SMEARING the Beast.

               Bozo guns the engine, crashing out the other end of the bar.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Bozo's car veers, flipping over a pile of rubble.

                                     BOZO
                         Motherfucker!!!

               Bozo squirms in his flipped car, UPSIDE-DOWN.

               He hears a Beast approaching. He pulls out a BUTTERFLY KNIFE 
               from the open glove box and SAWS at his safety belt.

               Cousin Beast leans into the passenger side of the car and 
               looks him right in the eye. Bozo raises the knife.

                                     BOZO
                         Lord, if I die, bury me upside down 
                         so the world can KISS MY ASS!

               Cousin Beast leaps in.

               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS

               The remaining TWO CARS race down the road.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               With the peddle to the floor, Bartender drives.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I think we're in the clear --

               BAM! Momma Beast lands on the roof. She reaches inside and 
               yanks out Bartender's throat. The car veers.

               Tuffy rights it, leaning over and stomping on the gas. Momma 
               yanks at the door, pulling it open. Tuffy pushes out 
               Bartender's corpse and JERKS the wheel.

               IN THE BACK

               Momma Beast falls back, knocking down Heroine. Momma Beast 
               nearly falls out, but manages to grab the rear gate with one 
               claw. Defenseless, Heroine backs away. Momma Beast holds on 
               tightly, pulling herself onto the bed of the truck.

               Tuffy stares back through the glass, unable to do anything.

               Momma Beast lunges towards Heroine. Momma Beast's claw snags 
               Heroine's locket, jerking Heroine right up to the creature's 
               face. The locket catches Momma's attention for split second.

               Her remaining eye goes from the picture of Charlie to Heroine.

               Momma's mouth opens wide. Heroine screams!

               And then, a beam of the RISING SUN catches the gold locket 
               and burns into Momma's eye. In one quick motion, she's gone, 
               taking the locket with her.

               Heroine lets out her breath, reaching around her neck for 
               what is no longer there. The truck SKIDS to a halt. Tuffy 
               jumps out.

                                     TUFFY
                         Are you okay?!

                                     HEROINE
                         I don't know, I think --

                                     ADULTERER (O.S.)
                         Hey!

               They both jump as Adulterer approaches.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Are you two all right? They left! We 
                         made it! I think we made it!

                                     TUFFY
                         They'll be back.

                                     HEROINE
                         We're safe until dark, but we need 
                         to find other people.

               Heroine rises and moves to the cab of the truck. She finds a 
               pack of cigs under the visor. Pops in the lighter.

                                     HEROINE
                         You know where the IGA grocery store 
                         is over in Red Mountain?

                                     ADULTERER
                         Um, yeah, ten miles west.

                                     HEROINE
                         They have a bomb shelter.

               PING! The lighter springs out, hot. Heroine lights up and 
               passes one to Tuffy.

                                     HEROINE
                         We'll meet in three hours?

                                     ADULTERER
                         I don't wanna go home alone... I 
                         don't wanna see what might have...

                                     TUFFY
                         Don't worry about that. Just go.

               Moment of silence as Adulterer and Tuffy look down the 
               desolate road.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm sorry about your son. I really 
                         am.

               Tuffy nods, affectionately touching his hand.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Where are you two going?

                                     HEROINE
                         We're going to get my little girl.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I wish you luck.

               The car peels off. Adulterer watches the car tear down the 
               road. He glances up at the RISING SUN.

               EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

               A sign reading "RED MOUNTAIN" swings lazily in the breeze.

               Tuffy and Heroine coast down a town road. There are random 
               POOLS OF RED BLOOD in the dirt. No one in sight.

               EXT. TOWN ROAD -- DAY

               Adulterer drives along a small town road. There's no sign of 
               life here either.

               EXT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               The car pulls up to the house. The only sound is the wind.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tuffy look at each other and proceed with caution.

               INT. ADULTERER'S CAR -- DAY

               He pulls up in front of his house. The front door is swinging 
               open, BANGING against the door frame.

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Heroine enters the ransacked house. Tuffy follows.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               He enters his house. It too, is a mess.

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               They look down the stairs to the basement. Nothing. They 
               move up the stairs to the second floor.

               SECOND FLOOR

               SMACK! They spin to the noise.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               He moves up the stairs to the master bedroom. SMACK!

               There's a noise at the end of the hall. SMACK!

               INT. HEROINE'S GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               They cautiously move to the last room in the hall. A 
               scratched, closed door without an outside handle.

                                     HEROINE
                         Oh no...

               Heroine kicks in the door and...

               There's a note on a teddy beer that says, "WE WENT TO THE 
               SHELTER. LOVE GRANDMA AND CHARLIE."

                                     TUFFY
                         They're alive!

               The shudders SMACK against the wall.

               INT. ADULTERER'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Adulterer holds a shattered PICTURE of his wife and two kids.

               He sighs and puts it down.

                                     ADULTERER
                         I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- DAY

               The sun shines bright in the cloudless sky. There is a stiff 
               wind that stirs up the dust. Bartender's car slowly lurches 
               up the street.

               INT. BARTENDER'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               Heroine and Tuffy skeptically look at the surroundings.  

                                     HEROINE
                         It's right up there, in the back of 
                         the store.

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

               The car pulls up in the back of the store and stops. They 
               get out, looking around. Tuffy holds a machete. Adulterer 
               kneels against his car.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where is everyone?

                                     ADULTERER
                         I don't know, I just got here. Did 
                         you find your girl?

                                     HEROINE
                         She's supposed to already be here.

                                     TUFFY
                         Your family?

               Adulterer shakes his head, acknowledging their death.

                                     TUFFY
                         I'm sorry.

               Adulterer sheepishly nods.

                                     HEROINE
                         This place is a ghost town.

               The group makes their way to the store front, peeking beyond 
               the glass doors.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (pointing)
                         Look!

               In the distance, in middle of a dusty parking lot, CHARLIE 
               stands staring at them.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie?

               Heroine runs to her and the others follow. Charlie fidgets 
               awkwardly. She cries and blood stains her dress.

                                     HEROINE
                         Charlie!

               As Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm.

                                     ADULTERER
                         Stop! There's something wrong!

                                     HEROINE
                         Honey!?

               The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her 
               ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly, 
               the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun.

                                     TUFFY
                         Oh god.

               The MOON moves in front of it -- a SOLAR ECLIPSE. Beast 
               HISSING and FLUTTERING is heard. Heroine looks from left to 
               right, panic stricken.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Mommy!

               The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something 
               is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but 
               Adulterer holds her at bay.

                                     ADULTERER
                         It's a trap!

               At a standstill, the group looks around for options. In the 
               distance, the darkness of the eclipse rolls towards them.

               Adulterer reacts, grabbing Tuffy's machete and lunging for 
               Charlie. The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole 
               cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer.

               The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting 
               Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground.

                                     ADULTERER
                              (gurgling blood)
                         Run!!!

               Heroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast.

               Tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store 
               front. As Adulterer's blood flows, Momma Beast drags him 
               towards her main prey. 

               A blanket of darkness leads Momma Beast, overtaking the 
               survivors. At the store front, Heroine pulls Charlie close. 

                                     HEROINE
                              (a whisper)
                         I love you...

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- AN HOUR LATER

               A string of ten WHITE VANS come to a halt in the dusty parking 
               lot. THE MAN IN TAN (45, buzz cut, leathery skin, cool) steps 
               from the lead van and surveys the ravaged small town.

               A swarm of men emerge from the other vehicles, all dressed 
               alike in work boots, gas masks and coveralls. They go into 
               action honing in on rubble with SENSORS and COUNTERS.

                         Sir, we have movement!

               The Man in Tan moves to a few men standing over a pool of 
               blood and guts. Using the sensor equipment, the COMPANY MAN 
               follows the blood trail that enters the grocery store.

               INT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- CONTINUOUS

               The place is torn to hell. Dust and soot hangs in the air.

               The men instinctively raise their high-powered rifles, letting 
               the flashlights on the ends lead the way. They follow the 
               trail of blood to a back FREEZER LOCKER.

               It's scratched, bashed and thrashed.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Open it.

               Company Man #2 steps forward and uses a metal-cutting chainsaw 
               to cut through the hinges. The door falls with a THUD.

               As the dust clears, Tuffy, Heroine and Charlie stare back at 
               the men, huddled together in a defensive stance.

               The Man in Tan creaks his neck.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Gentlemen, help them to safety.

               Heroine, holding Charlie, lurches back.

                                     HEROINE
                         You're not safe, she's still alive, 
                         she'll be back...

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Relax. We know. We're the calvary.

               The Man in Tan steps forward, guiding the group out.

               EXT. IGA (GROCERY STORE) -- MOMENTS LATER

               A bulky security truck pulls up. A DRIVER, holding a bloody 
               rag to his nose, gets out and moves to the back door.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         What happened to you?

               The Driver nods to the back of the truck, opening the door.

               Bozo lurches out, handcuffed and chained.

                                     BOZO
                         Get these cuffs off me! I'm a goddamn 
                         hero for Christ's sake!

               A shirtless, irate BOZO sits next to Grandpa and Grandma in 
               the back. He settles at the sight of the others.

                                     GRANDMA

                         really fuckin' appreciate it!

               Heroine covers her daughter's ears as the survivors are helped 
               into the truck. Tuffy sits, looking to Bozo.

                                     TUFFY
                         How'd you survive?

                         I found a new weak spot on 'em, but 
                         it damn ain't pretty getting to it.

               Heroine, last in the truck, turns to the men.

                                     HEROINE
                         Where are you taking us?

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         A trauma center. We have doctors 
                         waiting.
                              (off Heroine's pause)
                         You're in good hands now.

               The door shuts on Heroine's concerned face. The Man in Tan 
               locks eyes with the Driver.

                                     THE MAN IN TAN
                         Do it quick and spread the mess.

               The Driver nods back. Sinister implication understood.

               The Man in Tan lights a cigarette as he watches the truck 
               drive off. The truck's logo reads, "FARM-AID." He inhales.

               Freeze on him.

               NAME: THE MAN IN TAN 
               AGE: 45 
               OCCUPATION: HE CAN'T TELL YOU 
               PURPOSE: TO LAY GROUNDWORK FOR SEQUEL 
               LIFE EXPECTANCY: PRETTY F-ING GOOD

               The Man in Tan exhales a gust of smoke.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                          (whispers, sadistic)
               When you turn ten, your head's going
               to swell up real big like a watermelon
               and we're going to have to put you
               to sleep like they do with a dog.

                              TODD
               MOM!

                              TOM

                              JEANIE
               WHO PISSED ON THE TOILET SEAT!? MOTHER!!

                              TOM
               Where's Mom?

                              TODD
               Is my head going to swell up?

                              TOM
               What?!

                              JEANIE
               OH, MY GOD! THE TOILET PAPER'S ALL WET!!!

                              MOTHER (JOYCE)
                          (screams)
               TOM!

     The house falls dead SILENT. We hear footsteps thundering
     through the house. A TENSE STRAIN OF MUSIC FADES UP.

                              TODD
               What's that?

                              KIMBERLY
               Wait! Hold still!

                              TODD
               What?!

                              KIMBERLY
               You heads starting to swell up!!

     Todd screams. We hear the sound of Tom's footsteps running
     through the kitchen, down the hall, up the stairs, up the
     hallway. A door open.

                              TOM
                          (breathless)
               What's the matter?

                              JOYCE
                          (worried)
               It's Ferris!

                              TOM
               What's wrong?

                              JOYCE
                          (snaps)
               What's wrong? For Christ's sake!
               Look at him!

  2  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              2

     An eighteen year-old boy. He's staring lifelessly at CAMERA.
     His mouth's open. His eyes are bugged-out. His tongue is fat
     and dry in his mouth. He's laying in bed, on his side.

  3  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                            3

     Ferris' parents, TOM and JOYCE BUELLER are standing at
     bedside. They're in their late forties, early fifties.
     Handsome, upper-middle class parents. They're both dressed
     for work.

                              TOM
               Ferris?

                              JOYCE
               He doesn't have a fever. But he says
               his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.

  4  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              4

     His lifeless eyes blink.

  5  INT. BEDROOM. PARENTS                                         5

     Tom bends down and touches Ferris' forehead.

                              TOM
               What's the matter, Ferris?

                              JOYCE
               Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy.

     Tom takes one of Ferris' hands.

                              TOM
                          (discreetly)
               Should you call the doctor?

                              JOYCE
                          (whispers)
               He doesn't want me to.

                              TOM
               Why don't you want Mom to call
               the doctor?

     Ferris exhales loudly. He tries to speak but all he can
     manage is a choked gasp.

                              TOM
               What?

     Ferris tries again.

                              FERRIS
                          (raspy)
               Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.

     He starts to get up. Joyce gently pushes him back down.

                              FERRIS
               I have a test today. I have to take it.
               I want to get into a good college
               so I can have a fruitful life...

                              JOYCE
               You're not going to school like
               this.
                          (to Tom)
               Maybe I should call the office and
               tell them I won't be in.

                              FERRIS
               I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!

     He's gripped by a seizure. His body stiffens and he chokes.
     His older sister, JEANIE, walks into the room. She's dressed
     for school. She's cute and stuck-up. A major pill.

                              JEAN
               Oh, fine. What's this? What's his problem?

                              JOYCE
               He doesn't feel well.

                              JEAN
               Yeah, right. Dry that one out
               and you can fertilize the lawn.

                              TOM
               That's enough, Jeanie.

                              JEANIE
               You're not falling for this, are you?
               Tell me you're not falling for this.

                              FERRIS
               Is that Jeanie? I can't see that
               far. Jeanie?

                              JEANIE
               Pucker up and squat, Ferris.

                              JOYCE
                          (annoyed)
               Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school.

                              JEANIE
                          (angry, defeated)
               You're really letting him stay home?
               I can't believe this. If I was bleeding
               out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to
               school. It's so unfair.

                              FERRIS
               Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie.
               Be thankful that you're fit and have
               your health. Cherish it.

                              JEANIE
                          (to herself)
               Oh, I wanna puke.

     She glares at Ferris. Her eyes are mascara and vengence. She
     slips out of the room. Ferris' brother, TODD and sister,
     KIMBERLY peek into the room.

                              KIMBERLY
               Myocardial infarction?

                              JOYCE
               Get your stuff. Daddy'll be right
               down.

                              KIMBERLY
               Syphilitic meningitus? That would be
               a huge family embarrassment.

                              TOM
               Get downstairs!

                              KIMBERLY
               If he dies, I got dibs on his stereo.

     She turns sharply and exits.

                              TODD
                          (worried)
               Dad? Does my head look alright?

                              JOYCE
               Get downstairs! Now!

                              TODD
               Just answer me one question! Is it
               swelling up? Kim said it was going
               to get as big as...

                              KIMBERLY (OC)
               A WATERMELON!

                              TODD
                          (yells out the room)
               Shut-up!

                              JOYCE
               Get downstairs! NOW!

     Todd backs out of the room.

                              FERRIS
               I'll be okay. I'll just sleep.
               Maybe I'll have an aspirin around
               noon.

                              JOYCE
                          (to Ferris)
               I'm showing houses to the family
               from California today but I'll be in
               the area. My office'll know where
               I am, if you need me.

                              TOM
               I'll check it with you, too.

                              FERRIS
               It's nice to know I have such
               loving, caring parents. You're
               both very special people.

  6  CU. FERRIS                                                    6

     He acknowledges Tom with a pathetic flutter of his eyelids.

  7  INT. BEDROOM. JOYCE                                           7

     She strokes Ferris' hair.

                              JOYCE
               I hope you feel better, pumpkin.

     She leans down and kisses his forehead. Tom pats his
     shoulder.

                              TOM
               Get some rest.

  8  CU. FERRIS                                                    8

     Ferris lets out a wheeze. His glassy eyes follow his parents
     to the door.

                              JOYCE (OC)
               We love you, sweetie.

                              TOM (OC)
               Call if you need us.

     They close the door. The lock clicks. Ferris' eyes shift
     from the door to CAMERA. A sly, little smile crawls across
     his lips.

                              FERRIS
               They bought it.

     The MTV theme music ROARS IN.

  9  CU. TV SCREEN                                                 9

     The TV at the foot of Ferris' bed. The MTV logo is playing.

 10  INT. BEDROOM                                                 10

     Ferris yanks open the drapes. The pall of the sickroom
     disappears in the brilliant glow of morning sunlight.

                              FERRIS
               Incredible! One of the worst performances
               of my career and they never doubted it
               for a second.
                          (looks out the window)
               What a beautiful day!

     He turns from the window.

                              FERRIS
               Parents always fall for the clammy hands.
               It's physical evidence of illness. It's
               a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are
               generally pretty hip to the fever scams.
               And to make them work you have to go a hundred
               and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous
               mother and you end up in a doctor's office
               and that's worse than school.

     He flips on his stereo and fills the room with the MTV
     broadcast. A NEW SONG begins.

                              FERRIS
               Fake a stomach cramp and when you're
               doubled over, moaning and wailing, just
               lick your palms. It's a little stupid
               and childish but then so if high school.
               Right?

     He equalizes the sound a little.

                              FERRIS
               This is my ninth sick day with semester.
               If I go for ten, I'm probably going to
               have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely
               must make this one count.

     He exits into the hallway.

 11  INT. BATHROOM                                                11

     Ferris walks into the bathroom. It's littered with Jean's
     debris. He turns on the shower water.

                              FERRIS
               I don't care if you're fifty five
               or seven, everybody needs a day off
               now and then. It's a beautiful day.
               How can I be expected to handle
               high school?

     He bends down OUT OF FRAME as he loses his briefs. He pops
     up.

                              FERRIS
               I do actually have a test. That wasn't
               bullshit.

     He steps into the shower. Through the pebbled glass of the
     shower door we see Ferris' outline.

                              FERRIS
               That I care about it was.

 12  INT. BATHROOM. SHOWER STALL.                                 12

     Inside the shower. Ferris' hair is standing straight up.
     It's moulded into a fin with shampoo.

                              FERRIS
               It's on European socialism. I mean,
               really. What's the point? I'm not
               European. I don't plan to be European.
               So, who gives a shit if they're socialists?
               They could be fascist anarchists and it
               still wouldn't change the fact that I
               don't own a car.

     He turns the shower head around and uses it like a
     microphone.

                              FERRIS
                          (sings)
               WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY,
               TWIST AND SHOUT...

 13  INT. HALLWAY. LATER                                          13

     Ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around
     his waist. He's drying his hair with another of a different
     color.

                              FERRIS
               Not that I condone fascism. Or
               and "isms". "Isms", in my opinion
               are not good. A person should not
               believe in an "ism". He should
               believe in himself. John Lennon
               said it on his first solo album.
               "I don't believe in Beatles, I
               just believe in me." A good point
               there. Afterall, he was the Walrus.

     He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it.

                              FERRIS
               I could be the Walrus and I'd still
               have to bum rides off people.

     He passes CAMERA and goes into his room.

                              FERRIS (OC)
               I'm not very political? Let me
               put that into perspective...

 14  INT. BEDROOM                                                 14

     Ferris tosses the towel he's dried hair with on the bed.

                              FERRIS
               My uncle went to Canada to protest
               the war, right? On the Fourth of
               July he was down with my aunt and he
               got drunk and told my Dad he felt
               guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam.
               So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle
               Jeff? In wartime you want to be a
               pacifist and in peacetime you want
               to be a soldier. It took you twenty
               years to find out you don't believe
               in anything?"
                          (snaps his fingers)
               Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks.
                          (pause)
               Be careful when you deal with old
               hippies. They can be real touchy.

     He opens his door.

 15  INT. CLOSET                                                  15

     The door opens and Ferris rifles through his shirts.

                              FERRIS
               My mother was a hippie. But she
               lost it. She got old. If she listens
               to the White Album now? She doesn't hear
               music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is
               her favorite drug. It'll probably be
               mine, too. I hope not.

     He finds a shirt he likes. He steps back from the closet and
     puts it on. He drops the towel.

 16  INT. BEDROOM                                                 16

     He walks across the room to his dresser. He opens his
     underwear drawer. There's an old model of a submarine on the
     top of the dresser. He picks it up.

                              FERRIS
               In eighth grade a friend of mine
               made a bong out of one of these.
               The smoke tasted like glue.

     He pulls out a pair of underwear. He gets dressed as he
     speaks.

                              FERRIS
               His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a
               serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I
               like him. I'm probably his only friend.
               I do what I can for him. I mean, if
               I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others,
               right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.
               His father's dead and his sister's rumored
               to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit.
               She only puts out so people will hang out
               with her. It's sad but I don't hold it
               against her. Better to hold it against the
               guys who use her and don't care about her.
                          (pause)
               My parents never allowed Garth over here.
               It was because of his family. Mainly his
               older brother. He's in jail. I could see them
               not wanting his brother here because he is
               a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.
               I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of
               artificial fruit just so he could see what
               it was like to have his stomach pumped.
               But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault
               that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights
               with the parents on that point. I always felt
               for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once
               and I was laying on the dark worrying that
               his brother was going to come in and hack me
               to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.
               I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing".
               ... Nothing was wrong. There was no
               specific thing he was crying about.
               In fact, he wasn't really even aware that
               he was crying. He just cried himself to
               sleep every night. It was a habit. The
               guy's so conditioned to grief that if
               he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How
               could you possibly dump on guy who has to
               deal with that kinda shit? My parents
               acknowledge the trudge of the situation
               and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel
               for him but still the guy's banned from
               our house.

     He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet
     door. He doesn't like what he's wearing. He continues his
     speech as he disrobes.

                              FERRIS
               Unfortunately, now my parents have a
               legit argument. Garth doesn't need his
               brother to give him a rep anymore. He's
               getting one on his own. He's lost. It's
               over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from
               school. Gone from life. His legacy is
               a gas station.

 17  INT. HOUSE. STAIRCASE                                        17

     Ferris comes down the stairs. He's wearing a completely
     different outfit.

                              FERRIS
               One very serious danger is playing
               sick is that it's possible to believe
               your own act.

 18  INT. KITCHEN                                                 18

     Ferris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the
     refrigerator.

                              FERRIS
               That and boredom. Alot of people
               ditch and feel great for about an
               hour. Then they realize there's
               nothing to do. TV and food. I myself
               have ditched and gotten so bored I
               did homework. Figure that shit out.

     He takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice.

                              FERRIS
               You have to plan things out before
               you take the day off. Otherwise
               you get all nervous worrying about
               what to do and all you get is grief
               and the whole point is to take it
               easy, cut loose and enjoy.

     He crosses to the pantry.

                              FERRIS
               You blow your day and at about three
               o'clock, when everybody's out of school,
               you're going to wish you'd gone to
               school so you could be out having
               fun.

     He emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos.

                              FERRIS
               Avoid the misery. Plan your day.
               Do it right.

 19  INT. FAMILY ROOM                                             19

     Ferris walks in and flops down in an armchair.

                              FERRIS
               There's alot of pressure at work
               in my age group. And it's not always
               recognized.

     He reaches over and picks up the telephone. He sets it in
     his lap.

                              FERRIS
               Some guy whose hair is falling out
               and his stomach's hanging over his
               belt and everything he eats makes
               him fart, he looks at someone like
               me and thinks, "This kid's young and
               strong and has a full, rich future ahead
               of him, what's he got to bitch about?"

 20  CU. PHONE                                                    20

     He punches out a number.

 21  INT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS                                     21

     He remote controls the TV on.

                              FERRIS
               That's just one reason why I need a
               day off every now and then.

 22  EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE                                           22

     A sleek, modern house on a couple of deeply wooded acres. A
     prime house in a prime location. A telephone rings OVER.

 23  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                           23

     It's a dark, dreary sick room. Shades drawn, floor strewn
     with used tissues, nightstand a still-life of over the
     counter remedies. A high school boy, CAMERON FRYE, is laying
     in bed. We don't see his face, only a silhouette with a
     thermometer sticking out his mouth. U2's SUNDAY BLOODY
     SUNDAY is playing. He's mumbling random words.

                              CAMERON
               Food...shelter...no...yes...

     The phone rings. His hand reaches back and hits the speaker
     phone button.

                              CAMERON
                          (weak)
               Hello?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Cameron! What's happening?

                              CAMERON
               Very little.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               How do you feel?

                              CAMERON
               Shredded.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Is your mother in the room?

     Cameron takes the thermometer out of his mouth.

                              CAMERON
               She's not home. Where are you?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Home.

 24  INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS                             24

     Ferris is sprawled out in the chair.

                              FERRIS
               I'm taking the day off. Get
               dressed and come over.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               I can't. I'm sick.

                              FERRIS
               It's all in your head. Come on over.

 25  INT. CAMERON'S ROOM                                          25

     Cameron's insistant.

                              CAMERON
               I feel like complete shit, Ferris.
               I can't go anywhere.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'm sorry to hear that. Now, come
               on over and pick me up.

     Ferris disconnects. Cameron slowly hangs up the phone.

                              CAMERON
               I'm dying.

     The phone rings again. Cameron hits the speaker button.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               You're not dying. You just can't think
               of anything good to do.

 26  INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM                                     26

     Ferris hangs up.

                              FERRIS
               If anybody needs a day off, it's
               Cameron. He has alot of things to
               sort out before he graduates. He
               can't be wound this tight and go
               to college. His roommate'll kill
               him. I've come close myself. But I
               like him. He's a little easier to
               take when you know why he's like he
               is. The boy cannot relax. Pardon
               by French but Cameron is so tight
               that if you stuck a lump of coal up
               his ass, in two weeks you'd have a
               diamond.
                          (after-thought)
               And Cameron would worry that he'd
               owe taxes on it.

 27  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         27

     We hear roll call as CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the tile floor. A
     shoe's POV.

               Here.

     CAMERA enters a classroom. It travels past a teacher's Hush
     Puppies and heads up an aisle of desk past dirty yellow
     Reebocks, rotting Air Jordans, scuffed heels, pristine
     loafers...

               He's sick.
                          (pause)
               My best friend's sister's boyfriend's
               brother's girlfriend heard from this
               guy who knows this kid who's going
               with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out
               at 31 Flavors last night. I guess
               it's pretty serious.

                              TEACHER'S VOICE
                          (weary)
               Thank you, Simone.

                              GIRL'S VOICE
                          (cheery)
               No problem whatsoever.

                              TEACHER'S VOICE
               Drucker?

                              BOY'S VOICE
               What?

     WOUND-OUT CAR ENGINES COME UP LOUD.

 28  CU. TV                                                       28

     THE ROAD WARRIOR is playing on video cassette. The big chase
     at the end.

     INT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS

     He's sitting in the arm chair pretending it's Humongous' war
     wagon. He's wearing a hockey mash. He's steering. He reaches
     down and grabs an imaginary nitrous oxide valve.

     CU. TV

     Humongous reaches down and grabs a real nitrous oxide valve.
     He gives it a twist.

     CU. FERRIS

     He throws himself back against the chair.

     CU. TV

     The force of the rapid acceleration of his vehicle throws
     Humongous back in his seat.

     CU. FERRIS

     He bounces himself in the chair to simulate the bumpy high
     speed ride.

     CU. TV

     The was wagon hurtles down the road.

     CU. FERRIS

     He rears back in horror.

     CU. TV

     The war wagon is heading for a head-on collision with the
     tanker truck.

     CU. FERRIS

     Arms outstretched, head thrown back, braced for collision.

     CU. TV

     IMPACT!

     MOZART COMES UP.

 29  CU. FLOWERING TREE BRANCH                                    29

     Outside a bedroom window. A flowering crabtree branch.
     Petite pink flowers. WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDOW INTO THE
     ROOM. It's Jeanie's room. A pink and powder blue pig pen.
     Clothes everywhere, make-up, books, records. Ferris is
     sitting on her bed going through a purse.

                          FERRIS
               This is really degrading.

     He comes up with a crumpled dollar bill.

                              FERRIS
               Financing my activities this way.
               Very damaging to the self-image.
               But, hey, I'm broke. In times of
               crisis one must to what one must
               to. I'll pay it back. With interest.

     He comes up with a five.

                              FERRIS
               Regardless of how much shit sisters
               make you eat, how often they rat on
               you, how gross they act or how wicked
               and insensitive they can be, you should
               not alientate them. Because most likely
               they have cash and it's usually very easy
               to get your hands on.

     He holds up a twenty and snaps it. PINK FLOYD'S "MONEY"
     COMES UP.

 30  INT. LIVING ROOM                                             30

     The song plays as Ferris digs through the sofa cushions.

     CU. SOFA

     Ferris extracts a sticky quarter from a crevice.

 31  INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM                                        31

     Ferris is going through his father's pants pockets. Another
     crumpled bill surfaces.

 32  CU. WASHING MACHINE TOP                                      32

     A couple of stiff, hard, bleached singles that have gone
     through the wash lay on top of the washer. A hand scoops
     them up.

 33  CU. LUCITE ENCASED PROOF SET                                 33

     An obvious gift from a grandparent. A U.S. Mint proof set. A
     ten, a five and a single enclosed in a lucite frame. A
     screwdriver tip wedges between the two pieces of Lucite and
     pops them apart. A hand peels the bills off the backing.

 34  CU. KITCHEN DRAWER                                           34

     Hands ripping through the kitchen junk drawer. Locating a
     dollar bill.

 35  CU. COIN COLLECTION                                          35

     The familiar blue collector's album. One-by-one, the
     quarters are being popped out of their slots.

 36  CU. VACCUUM CLEANER                                          36

     The dusty, dirty contents of the bag are emptied on the
     floor. Fingers pick a dime out of a matted wad of filth.

 37  CU. SNOOPY BANK                                              37

     It's being shaken furiously.

 38  CU. BIRTHDAY CARD                                            38

     It's a child's card. It's slowly opened to reveal a crisp,
     new five.

 39  INT. HALL CLOSET                                             39

     The door opens and Ferris thrusts his hands into the pockets
     of the coats. He comes up with a ball of Kleenex. A roll of
     Tums. A squirt gun. Then a modest wad of bills. His face
     lights up as he counts out the cash. He closes the door.

 40  CU. FLOOR AND BED                                            40

     Ferris' face appears between the bed and the floor. His arm
     reaches out for a small metal bank hidden under the bed.

 41  CU. BANK                                                     41

     It's on a work bench. An awl is driven in between the door
     and the jamb. It pries the door open. Inside are trading
     cards, a charred doll's head, a Zippo lighter and, finally,
     a five dollar bill.

 42  INT. KITCHEN                                                 42

     Ferris is on his hands and knees under the kitchen table.

 43  CU. TABLE LEG                                                43

     Ferris lifts the leg and removes a quarter that's been used
     to balance the table.

 44  INT. KITCHEN                                                 44

     Ferris stands up and pockets the quarter.

 45  CU. FERRIS' BED                                              45

     A shower of coins and bills rain down on the sheets. The
     SONG ENDS.

 46  EXT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE. MORNING                             46

     A suburban realty company. A cute little building in town.

 47  INT. OFFICE                                                  47

     Joyce is behind a desk. Across from her are two WOMEN.
     They're also real estate agents.

                              JOYCE
               No one's going to consider a
               house with a black living room.
               Not even those jerks from Vermont.
               Let's be realistic.

                              AGENT 1
               Mrs. Volbeck's dead set against
               putting any money into the house.

     Joyce's phone intercom buzzes. She take the call.

                              JOYCE
               Joyce Bueller.

     Her eyes open wide with alarm.

                              JOYCE
               Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I
               completely forgot to call.

 48  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL                                             48

     A modern, suburban high school.

                              MAN'S VOICE
               Are you aware that your son is not
               in school today?

 49  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         49

     It's a passing period. The hall is clogged with students.

                              JOYCE'S VOICE
               Yes, I am. Ferris is home sick. I
               had a meeting first thing this
               morning. I should have called. It
               completely slipped my mind.

 50  INT. SCHOOL. DEAN'S OUTER OFFICE                             50

     A SECRETARY is at work at her desk. We hear the dean inside
     the office.

                              DEAN'S VOICE
               Are you also aware that Ferris does not
               have what we consider an exemplary
               attendance record?

 51  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. CU. DESK SIGN                            51

     It reads, EDWARD R. ROONEY. DEAD OF STUDENTS. The dean's
     feet are up on the desk, behind the sign. Moderately priced
     dress shoes.

                              JOYCE'S VOICE
               I don't understand.

                              DEAN'S VOICE
               I just had his file up.

     INT. OFFICE. CU. DEAN

     ED ROONEY is sitting behind his desk. He's tough, clean and
     straight as an I-beam. Short, neatly combed hair, suit and
     tie. He's toying with a pencil. He's confident to the point
     of arrogance.

                              ROONEY
               I just has his file up, Mrs. Bueller.

     Behind him is a computer terminal. He removes his feet from
     the desk and turns in his swivel chair.

                              ROONEY
               If Ferris thinks he coast this last
               month and still graduate, he's sorely
               mistaken.

                              JOYCE'S VOICE
               This is all news to me.

     CU. COMPUTER MONITOR

     The monitor on Rooney's desk displays Ferris' records.

                              ROONEY'S VOICE
               So far this semester alone, he's been
               absent nine times. Including today.

                              JOYCE'S VOICE
               Nine times?

     Under DAYS MISSED we see a number 9 suddenly change to a
     number 2.

     INT. OFFICE

     Rooney turns to the monitor. He reads off the screen.

                              ROONEY
               I have it right here in front of me. He's
               missed...

     He looks closer at the screen.

 52  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            52

     Ferris is at his Macintosh computer. He has his record up
     on the screen.

                              FERRIS
               I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's
               that for being born under a bad sign?

 53  INT. JOYCE'S OFFICE                                          53

     She's still on the phone with Rooney.

                              JOYCE
               I can give you every assurance that
               Ferris is home and that he is, in
               fact, very ill. I debated whether
               or not I should even leave him.
               I can appreciate that at this time
               of year children are prone to taking
               the day off, but in Ferris' case,
               he's truly a very sick boy.

 54  INT. FERRIS' BEDROOM                                         54

     MUSIC BLASTS. SOLO GUITAR.

     CU. SPEAKER

     The grille cloth is throbbing.

     CU. LED METERS

     The meters on the amplifier are totally in the danger zone.

     CU. TV MONITOR

     We see Ferris in his room with a guitar around his neck.
     He's playing.

     CU. VIDEO CAMERA

     A home video camera is capturing Ferris on tape.

 55  INT. CAMERON'S ROOM                                          55

     He's sitting on the edge of the bed buttoning his shirt. He
     sighs deeply and fall back on the bed.

 56  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         56

     Jeanie is at her locker during a passing period. A
     GIRLFRIEND comes up to her.

                              GIRL
               I'm really sorry about your brother.

                              JEANIE
               What're you sorry for? I have to live
               with the trouser snake.

                              GIRL
               No, I mean I heard he's really sick.

                              JEANIE
               Who said he's sick.

                              GIRL
               A whole bunch of people. They said
               he's like on the verge of death.

     Jeanie stares incredulously at the girl.

                              GIRL
               This guy in my biology class said
               that if Ferris dies he's giving
               his eyes to Stevie Wonder? He's
               really sweet isn't he?

     She smiles and exits. Jeanie cocks her head in bewilderment.
     She kicks her locker shut.

 57  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            57

     He's in bed on the phone.

                              FERRIS
               A sample of my blood was sent
               to Atlanta to the Center for
               Disease Control. I don't know,
               man, I'm bricking heavily.
                          (point to the
                           phone)
               Freshman.
                              (to the phone)
               Did you see Alien? When the guy
               had the creature in his stomach?
               It feels like that.

 58  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         58

     A FRESHMAN BOY is on the pay phone. A couple of his BUDDIES
     are standing at his side waiting anxiously for news.

                              BOY
               Goddamn! Are you kidding?

                              SECOND BOY
               What?

                              BOY
               Did you see Alien?

                              SECOND BOY
               No.

                              BOY
               You never rented the video cassette?

     Second boy shakes his head, no.

                              BOY
               Oh. He's really wasted.

                              THIRD BOY
                          (to the Second Boy)
               Who's he talking to?

                              SECOND BOY
               Ferris Bueller. You know him?

                              THIRD BOY
                          (excited)
               Yeah. He's getting me out of summer
               school.

                              BOY
               Anyway, I appreciate you letting us
               know how you're doing. We gotta split.
                          (pause)
               Huh?...Yeah, sure. Hold on.

                              SECOND BOY
                          (to Third Boy)
               Shit. I hope he doesn't die.
               I can't handle summer school.

     The boy snatches a passing GIRL.

                              BOY
               Did you see Alien?

                              GIRL
               Yeah, why?

     He hands her the phone.

                              GIRL
               Hello?
                          (pause)
               Who?
                          (pause)
               Hi, Ferris. How's your bod?
                          (jaw drops)
               Oh, my God! You're dying?
               Is it serious?
                          (pause)
               Shiit! Are you upset?

 59  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE                                           59

     Rooney's comparing his computer monitor to hard copy. His
     SECRETARY is standing over his shoulder.

                              ROONEY
               I don't trust this kid any further
               than I can throw him!

                              SECRETARY
               With your bad knee, you better
               not throw anybody, Ed.

     Rooney stares at her for a long beat.

                              ROONEY
               What's so dangerous about a character
               like Ferris Bueller is that he gives
               the good kids bad ideas. The last thing
               I need at this point in my career is
               fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples
               running around these halls.

                              SECRETARY
               He's very popular, Ed. Sportos, motorheads,
               geeks, sluts, pinheads, dweebies, wonkers,
               richies, they all adore him.

                              ROONEY
               That's exactly why I have to catch him
               this time. To show these kids that the
               example he sets is a first class ticket
               to nowhere.

                              SECRETARY
                          (impressed)
               Ooo. You sounded like Dirty Harry just
               now.

     Rooney looks up at her with a proud smile.

                              ROONEY
               Really?

     He unconsciously does an Eastwood squint.

 60  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE                                           60

     It's a glorious late spring day. A florist's truck drives
     past the house.

 61  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            61

     He's on the telephone. As he speaks he does a little
     MacPainting on his MacIntosh. A Modigliani nude.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, if you're not over here
               in fifteen minutes, you can find
               a new best friend. I'm serious, man.
               This is bullshit, making me wait
               around the house for you.

 62  INT. CAMERON'S BEDROOM                                       62

     Cameron's back in bed.

                              CAMERON
               I'm sick. I feel like shit. Why can't
               you leave me alone?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               You're not up for some good times?
               It's a beautiful day. It's almost
               summer. If this was Hawaii, we'd be
               surfing.

 63  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            63

     He's growing weary of Cameron's wimpishness.

                              FERRIS
               You want to stay home and try
               to have the shits? Try to barf?
               Try to feel worse?

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               I don't have to try.

                              FERRIS
               Be a man. Take some Pepto Bismol
               and get dressed. You're boring me
               with this stuff.

     The other phone line rings.

                              FERRIS
               Squeeze you buns for a second. I
               got another call.

     He puts Cameron on hold. He clears his throat and answers
     the second line. He sounds like he's on his last breath.

                              FERRIS
               H--hell-o?

 64  EXT. OFFICE BUILDING. DOWNTOWN                               64

     A LaSalle Street office tower.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Ferris?

 65  INT. TOM'S OFFICE                                            65

     He's behind his desk. Nice office. Two windows. Herman
     Miller desk and chair.

                              TOM
               You sound miserable.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Really? Darn! I thought I was improving.

                              TOM
               Were you sleeping?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I was trying to do some homework.

 66  CU. COMPUTER MONITOR                                         66

     A closer view of the rude drawing Ferris is making.

                              FERRIS (OC)
               I'm so worried about falling behind.

     INT. FERRIS' ROOM

     He leans back from the monitor and sips a Coke.

                              FERRIS
               Dad? Can you hold on a second?

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Sure, pal. Are you alright?

                              FERRIS
               Just a little phlegm on the phone.
               Hold on.

     He puts his father on hold.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron? It's my Dad.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               Oh, that's just great. Are you busted?

                              FERRIS
               It's completely cool. He's just
               checking up on me. Now, listen to
               me. I'm working on getting some
               heavy bucks out of him. So, the least you
               can do is hurry up and get over here.
               Bye.

     He disconnects and gets his father back. He switches back to
     his sick voice.

                              FERRIS
               Sorry, Dad. The moment before you
               called, I had a chest spasm and I
               blew lung fluid all over the place.
               It was making me ill looking at it.
               But gee, it's sure great of you to call.
               I'm sure there're alot of fathers
               who wouldn't take time out from
               their busy schedules to call a dumb,
               sick teenager.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Hey, pal, what was I supposed to do?

     Ferris reaches out and hits a key on his computer. The
     screen dumps the drawing.

                              FERRIS
               Give yourself some credit, Dad. It
               was a mammoth gesture. It's like those
               savings bonds you used to give me
               every Christmas.
                          (looks at CAMERA and smiles)
               It was that kind of concern.

     CU. COMPUTER SCREEN

     A message is flashing: "TRANSMITTING DATA".

     INT. FERRIS' ROOM

     He turns away from the computer and puts his feet up on the
     desk. He lights a cigarette.

                              FERRIS
               You had to work hard for the money
               to buy those things, right?

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Not any harder than anybody else.

     Ferris mouths Tom's words as he says them.

 67  EXT. CHICAGO LOOP. DIAMONDVISION SCREEN                      67

     Ferris' drawing suddenly appears on the billboard.
     Pedestrians stop to look.

 68  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            68

     He blows a smoke ring.

                              FERRIS
               You work so hard I'll bet you don't
               even remember where those bonds are,
               right?

     Ferris points a finger in the air as a cue to his father.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Wrong.

     He nods.

                              FERRIS
               Oh, yeah? You're pulling my leg. You're
               just trying to cheer me up.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Like hell I am. They're in a shoebox
               in my closet.

     Ferris smiles. He looks at CAMERA. He's gotten exactly what
     he wants.

                              FERRIS
                          (to CAMERA, normal
                           voice)
               Was that a class move or what?
               The guy gave it up faster than
               a drunk Catholic girl. I hope my
               kids don't pull this shit on me.
                          (thinks)
               Of course, if they didn't, they'd
               be dumb and abnormal and they'd
               probably never move out of my
               house and I'd have to support them
               until I die. I take it back.
                          (to the phone,
                           sick voice)
               Dad? All this talking has made me
               kind of light-headed. I think
               I better lie down.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Okay, pal. You take care. I'll
               call you after lunch.

                              FERRIS
               You don't have to, Dad.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               I want to. Bye now.

     He hangs up. Ferris sighs.

                              FERRIS
               You win some, you lose some.

     He turns his desk chair around and gets up.

                              FERRIS
               I'm so disappointed in Cameron.
               Twenty bucks says he's sitting
               in his car debating about whether
               or not he should go out.

 69  INT. CAR. CAMERON                                            69

     He's sitting behind the wheel of his car.

                              CAMERON
               We're gonna get caught. No doubt
               about it.

     He cuts the engine.

                              CAMERON
               I'm not doing it.

     He sits for half a beat.

                              CAMERON
               He'll keep calling until I come
               over.

     He sighs and restarts the engine. Another beat.

                              CAMERON
               Actually, what'll happen is I'll
               get caught. Ferris'll escape.

     Another beat. He stops the engine. A CRASH OF HORROR MUSIC.

 70  CU. DRESSER DRAWER                                           70

     Hands curl around the drawer pulls. The drawer is opened
     slowly, ominously. The hands lift a sweater out. A HERALDIC
     STING as we see a men's magazine beneath the sweater.

     INT. FERRIS' ROOM

     He takes out the magazine. He leafs through the pages for
     the pictorials as he speaks.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron'll go on like that for a
               good thirty minutes. The guy
               is a shellfish when it comes to
               making a decision. The reason
               he doesn't fell good is, he
               worries about everything. He's
               the only guy I know who's deeply
               concerned that when he grows up
               there'll be a critical shortage
               of strategic metals.

     He exits the room.

 71  INT. HALLWAY                                                 71

     Ferris comes out of his room and heads down the hallway.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron's also the only guy
               I know who knows what strategic
               metals are.
                          (waves the magazine)
               Pardon moi.

     He goes into the bathroom. We HEAR THE TOILET SEAT SLAM
     DOWN.

                              FERRIS
                          (sings)
               MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE MY MOTHER,
               SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED...

 72  INT. CLASSROOM. LATER                                        72

     A stunningly beautiful girl, SLOANE PETERSON, is sitting at
     her desk in a history class. She's staring out the window as
     a tweedy MALE TEACHER delivers a dry, dusty lecture.

                              TEACHER
               Roosevelt's health had seriously
               deteriorated by the time he met
               with Churchill and Stalin at Yalta.
                          (sneezes)
               Pardon me.

     The classroom door opens and the school NURSE walks in. For
     a moment, the teacher thinks she's come in because she heard
     him sneeze. She crosses to him and whispers in his ear.

     SLOANE

     She, like the others, watches the nurse curiously.

     INT. CLASSROOM. TEACHER AND NURSE

     The teacher's face drops as he's delivered an obvious piece
     of disturbing news. He nods grimly to the Nurse. She looks
     at the kids.

                              NURSE
               Sloane Peterson?

     SLOANE

     Sits up in her seat.

     NURSE

     She's a picture of compassion and understanding.

                              NURSE
               May I see you outside for a moment?
               There's been an emergency.

     SLOANE

     A smile curls across her lips. As she gathers her books she
     looks to the GIRL next to her.

                              SLOANE
                          (whispers)
               Dead grandmother.

 73  INT. HALLWAY                                                 73

     The Nurse is gently holding Sloane's hand.

                              NURSE
                          (nods solemnly)
               Dead grandmother.

 74  CU. ROONEY                                                   74

     He has a suspicious look on his face.

                              ROONEY
               Dead grandmother?

     INT. DEAN'S OFFICE

     Rooney's at his desk. His secretary is standing across from
     him.

                              SECRETARY
               That's what Mr. Peterson said. I
               had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane.

                              ROONEY
               Who's this girl's going with?

                              SECRETARY
               It's so hard to tell. I see her
               alot with Ferris Bueller.

     Rooney smiles. His suspicions are confirmed.

                              ROONEY
               Could you get me Mr. Peterson's
               daytime number?

     As the secretary starts out of the room, Rooney's phone
     rings. She stops and answers the desk phone.

                              SECRETARY
               Edward Rooney's office.
                          (pause)
               Yes. Can you hold? Thank you.

     She puts the call on hold.

                              SECRETARY
               It's Mr. Peterson.

     Rooney is startled. He thinks for a beat then reaches for
     the phone.

                              SECRETARY
               Do you still want his number?

     Rooney answers her with an annoyed look. She smiles and
     backs out. He punches the phone button.

                              ROONEY
               Ed Rooney.

                              MAN'S VOICE
               Ed? This is George Peterson.

                              ROONEY
               How are you today, sir?

                              MAN'S VOICE
               We've had a bit of bad luck this
               morning as you may have heard.

     Rooney rolls his eyes. It's so obvious it's not Mr.
     Peterson.

                              ROONEY
               I heard. And, gosh, I'm all broken
               up. Huh? Oh, sure. I'd be happy to
               release Sloane. You produce a corpse
               and I'll release Sloane. I want to
               see this dead grandmother firsthand.

     The secretary stops cold in the doorway. She turns to Rooney
     in horror. He covers the phone.

                              ROONEY
                          (whispers)
               It's Ferris Bueller. Nervy litttle
               punk. I'm gonna set a trap and let
               his walk right into it!
                          (to phone)
               That's right. Cart the stiff in and
               I'll turn over your daughter. It's
               school policy. Was this your mother?

     Rooney's other line rings.

 75  INT. SECRETARY'S OFFICE                                      75

     She steps out of Rooney's office and picks up the other
     line.

                              SECRETARY
               Ed Rooney's office.

     Her jaw drops.

                              SECRETARY
               Hold, please.

     She puts the call on hold and hangs up. She hurried into
     Rooney's office.

 76  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE                                           76

     Rooney's chewing out the person on the other line.

                              ROONEY
               I'll tell you want, you don't
               like my policies, you can just
               come on down and smooch by big
               old ugly ass. You hear me?

     The secretary comes in. She's waving her arms furiously.
     Rooney tries to wave her away. He's angry. She stomps her
     foot. Rooney covers the phone.

                              ROONEY
               What!?

                              SECRETARY
               Ferris Bueller's on line two.

     CU. ROONEY'S FOOT

     It freezes in mid-tap.

     CU. ROONEY'S HAND

     The pencils falls from his fingers.

     CU. ROONEY'S FACE

     A mask of horror. He glances at the phone.

     CU. PHONE

     The second line light is flashing.

     CU. ROONEY

     He blinks, cocks his head, twitches.

 77  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            77

     He's zipping his pants, fastening his belt. The phone's
     cradled against his shoulder. He speaks in the same voice he
     used on his father.

                              FERRIS
               Mr. Rooney? I'm sorry to disturb
               you at work but I was wondering if
               it would be possible for my sister
               to bring home any assignments from
               my classes that I may need.

 78  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. ROONEY                                   78

     He's staring blankly ahead.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Thank you, sir.

     He nods.

     CU. PHONE

     Rooney's finger gingerly presses the button on the waiting
     call.

     CU. ROONEY

     He winces as he returns to the first call.

 79  INT. FERRIS' HOUSE. KITCHEN                                  79

     Cameron's on the phone in the kitchen. He's doing a deep,
     phoney "father" voice.

                              CAMERON
               You oughta be sorry for Christ's
               sake! A family member dies and
               you insult me. What's the matter
               with you, anyway?

 80  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. ROONEY                                   80

     He apologies profusely to Cameron. He's perspiring,
     trembling.

                              ROONEY
               I don't know. I thought you were
               someone else. You have to know,
               sir, that I would never deliberately
               insult you. I can't begin to tell
               you how embarrassed I am.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               Pardon my French but you're an asshole!

     Rooney nods enthusiastically.

                              ROONEY
               Absolutely! I most certainly am.

 81  INT. KITCHEN                                                 81

     Cameron lays into Rooney.

                              CAMERON
               This isn't over yet, buster. You
               just make sure my daughter's out
               in front of the school in ten
               minutes. Do you read me?

                              ROONEY'S VOICE
               Load and clear, Mr. Peterson.

                              CAMERON
               Call me sir, goddamn it!

                              ROONEY'S VOICE
               Sir.

                              CAMERON
               That's better.

     Ferris strolls into the kitchen to catch the last of the
     conversation. Cameron covers the phone.

                              CAMERON
                          (to Ferris)
               I'm scared shitless, Ferris! What
               is Rooney guesses my voice!

                              FERRIS
               Impossible. You're doing great.

     Cameron sighs and goes back to the phone.

                              CAMERON
                          (clears his throat)
               I don't have all day to bark at you
               so I'll make this short and sweet.

     Ferris gives Cameron an enthusiastic thumbs up.

                              FERRIS
                          (mouths)
               Great!

     Cameron smiles proudly.

                              CAMERON
               I want my daughter out in front
               of the school in ten minutes. By
               herself. I don's want anyone around...

     Ferris smacks Cameron. He's said the wrong thing. He covers
     the phone.

                              CAMERON
               What'd I do?

                              FERRIS
               Out in front my herself? It's too
               suspicious! He'll think something's
               up, moron. Cover it.

     Cameron panics. He holds the phone out to Ferris.

                              CAMERON
               You do it!

     Ferris waves his arms angrily.

                              FERRIS
               Talk!

     Cameron takes a deep breath. He clears his throat and puts
     on his father's voice.

                              CAMERON
               I changed my mind, fella. You be out
               in front with her! I wanna have a
               few words with you!

     Ferris slaps Cameron. The phone flies out of his hand.

 82  CU. ROONEY                                                   82

     He winces as the phone hits the floor with a loud CLONK!
     We HEAR THE BOYS SCRAMBLING TO PICK UP THE PHONE, THEN
     CAMERON CLEARING HIS THROAT.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               On second thought, I don't have
               time to talk to you. We'll get
               together soon and have lunch.

     We HEAR A SLAP AND THE CALL DISCONNECTS.

 83  INT. FERRIS' KITCHEN                                         83

     Cameron's rubbing the side of his head.

                              CAMERON
               Why'd you hit me?!

                              FERRIS
               Where's your brain?!

                              CAMERON
               Why'd you hit me?!

                              FERRIS
               Where's your brain?!

                              CAMERON
               Why'd you hit me?

                              FERRIS
               Where's your brain?

                              CAMERON
               I asked you first.

                              FERRIS
               How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's
               going to be there with her?!

                              CAMERON
               I said for her to be there alone
               and you freaked!

                              FERRIS
               My, God, you're so stupid!
                          (aside)
               I didn't hit you, I lightly slapped
               you.

                              CAMERON
               You hit me. Look, don't ask me to
               participate in your crap if you
               don't like the way I do it!

     Ferris is incredulous at Cameron's stupidity. Cameron's
     anger is intensified by his embarrassment.

                              CAMERON
               I was home, sick. You get me out of
               bed, being me over here, make me
               jeopardize my future, make me do
               a phoney phone call on a dean of
               students, a man who could squeeze
               my nuts into oblivion and then
               you deliberately hurt my feelings.

                              FERRIS
               I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.

                              CAMERON
               Oh, really?

                              FERRIS
               Yeah, really.

     Cameron glares at Ferris.

                              CAMERON
               Hey, Ferris? Have a nice life.

     He turns and heads out of the room. Ferris sighs.
                              FERRIS
               Cameron?

                              CAMERON
               Stick it up your ass, Ferris.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
               to jam you. It was uncalled for.

     Cameron stops.

                              CAMERON
               You're serious?

     He turns around.

                              FERRIS
               Dead serious.

     Cameron smiles. He appreciates Ferris apology.

                              CAMERON
               Thanks.

                              FERRIS
               You did screw up through, right?
               Not that is was necessarily all
               you fault. Right?

                              CAMERON
                          (suspiciously)
               Why?

                              FERRIS
               To fix this situation, I'm going
               to have to ask you for a small favor.

     Cameron's jaw drops.

 84  INT. GARAGE                                                  84

     The door opens slowly, dramatically as we hear a heraldic
     fanfare. Light streams in to reveal Cameron and Ferris
     looking at the car. Ferris is smiling with excitement and
     awe. Cameron is frowning with trepidation and fear.

     CU. FERRARI STALLION

     The prancing black stallion. We move up from the stallion to
     the erotic red hood of a 1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California.

     CAMERON AND FERRIS

     Cameron's face is ashen. The end of the world is at hand.
     Ferris is in heaven.

                              CAMERON
                          (grim monotone)
               1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California. Less
               than a hundred were made. It has a
               market value of $265,000. My father
               spent three years restoring it. It
               is joy, it is his love, it is his
               passion.

                              FERRIS
               It is his fault he didn't lock the
               garage.

                              CAMERON
               Ferris, my father loves this car more
               than life itself. We can't take is out.

                              FERRIS
               A man with priorities so far out of
               whack doesn't deserve such a fine
               automobile.

                              CAMERON
               He never drives it, Ferris. He just
               rubs it with a diaper.

                              FERRIS
               We can't pick up Sloane in your car,
               Cameron. Rooney'd never believe Mr.
               Peterson drives that piece of shit.

                              CAMERON
               It's not a piece of shit.

                              FERRIS
               It's a piece of shit. Don't worry
               about it. I don't even have a piece
               of shit. I have to envy yours. Look,
               I'm sorry but there's nothing else
               we can do.

                              CAMERON
               He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has
               it tatooed on his wrist.

                              FERRIS
               He doesn't trust you?

                              CAMERON
               No.

                              FERRIS
               Alright, look, this is real simple.
     He puts his arm around Cameron.

                              FERRIS
               Whatever miles we put on it, we'll
               take off.

                              CAMERON
                          (suspicious)
               How?

                              FERRIS
                          (big, proud smile)
               We'll drive home backwards.

     Cameron shakes his head, no.

                              CAMERON
               Forget it. I'm putting my foot down,
               Ferris. You'll have to think of
               something else...

     CU. FERRARI GRILLE

     Cameron's protests are drowned out by the distinctive roar
     of the twelve cylinders.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               ...You're not talking me into this
               one. I have to live with the man.
               I'm sorry but...

     The roar of the engine is overtaken by the sound of a
     crowded school hallway.

 85  INT. SCHOOL. JEANIE                                          85

     She comes out of a classroom. She stops as Sloane and Rooney
     walk past. Sloane has her coat on and she's carrying her
     books. Jeanie watches her suspiciously.

 86  EXT. SCHOOL                                                  86

     The Ferrari is parked out in front. The top is down.

 87  INT. FERRARI                                                 87

     Ferris is driving. He's wearing a man's hat and sunglasses.
     Cameron's in the back.

                              CAMERON
               Are you crazy?! Put the top back
               up!

                              FERRIS
               This is perfect top-down weather.
                              CAMERON
               What about Rooney?

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, the more obvious we are,
               the less likely we are to get
               caught.

                              CAMERON
               That makes no sense whatsoever.

                              FERRIS
               The adult mind is a suspicious
               machine.
                          (look around at Cameron)
               Stay down, man.

     Cameron squeezes himself lower.

                              CAMERON
               Howcome it's my Dad's car and
               I'm taking all the risk and I have
               to ride back here?

                              FERRIS
               I don't have an explanation.

 88  EXT. SCHOOL                                                  88

     Rooney and Sloane come out the door.

                              ROONEY
               Once again let me say how deeply
               saddened I am by your loss.

                              SLOANE
               Huh?

                              ROONEY
               Were you close to your grandmother?

                              SLOANE
               Oh. Um. Yeah. Very. She was a terrific
               lady. Very hip. Very old. Yeah.

                              DEEP VOICE
               Oh, Sloane! Dear!

     Sloane looks across at the Ferrari. Rooney looks.

     THEIR POV

     Ferris is looking out across the roof of the Ferrari. He's
     careful to keep his nose and mouth below the roofline.

                              FERRIS
               Hurry along now!

     EXT. SCHOOL

     Rooney's suspicious. Sloane smiles and bids Rooney a hasty
     farewell.

                              SLOANE
               I guess that's my Dad. Thanks.
               See ya.

     She hurries to the car. Rooney watches her. Something does
     compute for him.

 89  INT. SCHOOL. JEANIE                                          89

     She's watching out the door. She sees the Ferrari pull away.

 90  EXT. SCHOOL. ROONEY                                          90

     He can't quite put his finger on what's bothering him.

 91  INT. FERRARI                                                 91

     Sloane shrieks with delight. She leans across the console
     and gives Ferris a kiss.

                              SLOANE
               This is so great! I can't believe
               it! Right in front of Rooney!

     She laughs and turns to Cameron.

                              SLOANE
               Hi, Cameron. You comfortable?

                              CAMERON
               Hi. No.

                              SLOANE
               What a fabulous car!

                              CAMERON
               Enjoy it quick. It' s going home.

                              FERRIS
               It was risky, it was bold but
               it was totally necessary.

                              SLOANE
               What're we gonna do?

                              FERRIS
               The question isn't "what are we
               gonna do", the question is "what
               aren't we going to do."

                              CAMERON
               Don't tell me we're not going to
               take the car home. Please.

                              FERRIS
                          (to CAMERA)
               If you had access to a car like this
               would you take it back right away?
               Would you give up feeling like a
               ton just to ease your best friend's
               tension?

     He smiles.

                              FERRIS
               Either would I.

 92  EXT. STREET. FERRARI                                         92

     It accelerates away like a shot.

 93  EXT. SUBURBAN BANK                                           93

     A fresh, modern bank building. The clock outside read 9:53.
     The Ferrari pulls into the parking lot.

 94  INT. BANK. DOORS                                             94

     Ferris, Cameron and Sloane walk in. Ferris is cocky and
     confident. Sloane's still intoxicated with her freedom.
     Cameron's having stomach trouble. Ferris leads the way to an
     open teller window.

     INT. BANK. TELLER

     A WOMAN about seventy with a silver blue beehive. It's about
     four inches higher the highest beehive you're ever seen. As
     she moves the beehive hits a small sign over her head. She's
     been at the bank since they opened. She smiles when she sees
     Ferris.

                              TELLER
               Ferris Bueller?

     FERRIS

     He's at the window. On either shoulder are Cameron and
     Sloane. Ferris smiles. Cameron blanches.

                              FERRIS
               Hello, Mrs. Froeling. How are you?

     TELLER

     She pats the rock-solid mass of blue hair. In doing so she
     locates a missing ball point pen. She withdraws it from the
     hair and smiles at it's reappearance.

                              TELLER
               I passed a kidney stone Tuesday, so
               I'm a little pooped but other than
               that, I'm as chipper as can be.
                          (something occurs to her)
               Say, should you be in school?

     FERRIS

     He lays his savings bonds on the counter.

                              FERRIS
               Me?
                          (polite laugh)
               I'm out of school, Mrs. Froeling.
               In fact. I'm married. This is my
               wife...Madonna.

     Sloane suppresses a laugh.

                              FERRIS
                          (to Cameron)
               And this is my brother-in-law,
               ZZ Top. ZZ, this is Mrs. Froeling.

     Cameron isn't amused.

                              TELLER
                          (to Cameron)
               Is Top a Slavic name?

                              CAMERON
               Yeah.

                              FERRIS
               I'd like to cash these in, please.
               We're having a baby and we need the
               cash for a crib, clothes, diapers,
               food pellets, leash, water dish...

     INT. BANK. TELLER WINDOW

     Mrs. Froeling takes the bonds with a hearty smile. The
     latter part of the conversation sails over her like a line
     drive.

                              TELLER
               A baby!
                          (to Sloane)
               You must be so excited.

     Cameron groans and turns away from the sham.

                              SLOANE
               I'm thrilled, ma'am. I'm especially
               looking forward to wearing those
               jeans with the stretch panel in
               front.

     Mrs. Froeling thumbs through the bonds.

                              TELLER
               Are you hoping for a boy or
               a girl?

                              SLOANE
               Actually, we're hoping for a car.

     CU. CAMERON

     He's spooked by the games playing. He scans the bank
     nervously. He blinks, focuses, blinks again.

     HIS POV

     Joyce is with a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE and their bored,
     sour-puss teenage son, BOYD. He's sitting in a chair with
     his legs slung over the sides waving a Bic lighter back and
     forth across his rump. The parents are Joyce's clients from
     Vermont. A LOAN OFFICER is discussing the local financing
     situation with them. His is an open office adjacent to the
     teller windows. Joyce's back is to the tellers.

     CU. CAMERON

     It's like he's just witnesses an ax murder.

                              CAMERON
               Shit...

     INT. BANK. JOYCE

     Her back is to the teller windows. She's conducting her
     meeting. Behind her we see Cameron grab Ferris and point her
     out to him. He waves. Cameron slaps his arm.

     INT. BANK. TELLER WINDOW

     Mrs. Froeling shows Ferris the savings bonds.

                              TELLER
               These bonds aren't mature. If you hold
               onto them another two years you'll get
               an additional four dollars...

                              FERRIS
               I'm aware of that.

                              TELLER
               You're throwing away four dollars.

                              FERRIS
               No, ma'am, I'm giving it to the
               government. They need it. Do you
               know what an aircraft carrier's
               going for these days?

     INT. BANK. JOYCE

     She concludes her meeting. She shakes hands with the loan
     officer and stands. The Vermont Couple stands. Boyd scrapes
     the bottom of his shoe on the desk, leaving a glob of mud
     behind and he stands. Joyce turns into the bank. Ferris,
     Cameron and Sloane are gone. She escorts her customers out.

     INT. BANK. DOOR

     Joyce and the Vermont Couple approach the doors. Boyd lays a
     luggie in the drinking fountain. Mrs. Froeling passes with
     the savings bonds. She stops when she sees Joyce.

                              JOYCE
               Mrs. Froeling, how are you?

                              MRS. FROELING
               I passed a kidney stone Tuesday.
                          (shifts gears, to Joyce)
               Say, you must be very proud.

     Joyce doesn't know what she's talking about.

                              MRS. FROELING
                          (whispers)
               I met Madonna.

     She pats Joyce on the arm.

                              MRS. FROELING
               She told me everything. Keep me posted,
               I'll want to send a gift.

     She toodles on her way. Joyce and the Vermont Couple are
     completely baffled.

 95  EXT. BANK                                                    95

     Joyce and the Vermont Couple walk along the side of the
     bank, heading for the parking lot. Boyd's tagging along
     behind. He picks up a stone and hurls it into the parking
     lot.

                              JOYCE
               My son's home sick today. If
               you wouldn't mind, on our way
               back to the office, I'd like
               to just run in and check up on him.

     We HEAR A METALLIC PING! as Boyd's missle hits a car.

                              MOTHER
               Of course.

     They pass a show window. As they pass, we hold on the
     window. It's promoting saving for college educations. A
     mannequin father is congratulating his mannequin son in a
     mortar and gown as a stiff Sloane, Ferris and Cameron look
     on proudly.

 96  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE                                           96

     His secretary is dialing a number for him.

                              SECRETARY
               This is the Peterson's home.

     She hands the phone to Rooney.

                              SECRETARY
               Watch your mouth this time.

     Rooney glares at her.

                              ROONEY
               Ferris Bueller's behind this. There's
               no doubt in my mind. That's what I was
               saying this morning. Why he has to be stopped.
               He's got Sloane Peterson involved in this
               thing now. See?

     The secretary nods.

                              SECRETARY
               And her grandmother, too.

 97  CU. PHONE ANSWER MACHINE                                     97

     It clicks on. We hear a grieved woman's voice. It sounds an
     awful lot like Sloane.

                              SLOANE
               We can't come to the phone right now.
               We've had a death in the family. If
               you need to reach us we'll be at
               the following number...

 98  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE                                           98

     Rooney quickly takes down a number.

 99  EXT. CAMERON'S HOUSE                                         99

     His answering machine clicks on. We hear Cameron's voice.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               You have reached the Coughlin Bros.
               Mortuary. We are unable to come to
               the phone right now but if you'll leave
               your name and number...

100  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE                                          100

     Rooney hangs up the phone.

                              ROONEY
               Something's going on, goddamn it.

     The secretary's looking at a newspaper on Rooney's desk.
     She's not listening to him.

                              SECRETARY
               There's a railroad strike.

                              ROONEY
               And I'm going to stop it!

                              SECRETARY
               My brother-in-law'll appreciate it.

     Rooney looks at her, puzzled.

                              ROONEY
               What?

                              SECRETARY
               My brother-in-law rides the train
               to work.

     Rooney stares at her like she's crazy.

                              ROONEY
               Who gives a good goddamn?

101  EXT. EDENS EXPRESSWAY                                       101

     The major thoroughfare into the city of Chicago from the
     suburbs. The Ferrari streaks past. In the distance we see
     the Sears Tower, the Hancock Building and the Standard Oil
     Building.

102  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                        102

     Jeanie's walking down the hall. She's stopped by a KID with
     a Coke can.

                              KID
               Yo. We're collecting money to
               buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney.

     Jeanie stares at him. She's flabbergasted at the proportions
     her brother's scan has reached.

                              KID
               They run about fifty g's so it
               you could help out...

                              JEANIE
               Go piss up a flagpole!

                              KID
               Huh?

     She knocks the can out of his hands and storms down the hall.
     The kid yells after her.

                              KID
               Hey, babe! Some day you might
               need a favor from Ferris Bueller!
               Then where'll you be?!

     He reaches for the can.

                              KID
               Heartless wench...

103  EXT. CHICAGO LOOP. PARKING GARAGE                           103

     The Ferrari pulls into a large parking garage.

     EXT. GARAGE

     Ferris, Sloane and Cameron get out. Cameron's having fits.

                              CAMERON
               We can't leave the car here!

                              FERRIS
               Why not?
                              CAMERON
               Because we can't! I want it back
               home where it belongs!

                              SLOANE
               What could happen to it?

                              CAMERON
               It could get stolen, wrecked, scratched,
               you name it.

                              FERRIS
               I'll give the guy a five to watch it.

                              CAMERON
               What guy?

     CU. PARKING ATTENDANT

     He smiles with relish at the car. 6'6", 240. An IQ that
     equals his hourly wage. Shoulder-length hair stuffed into a
     hairnet Gold teeth. Earring. Goatee.

     EXT. PARKING LOT

     The Attendant swaggers over to the car. Ferris slips him a
     give.

                              FERRIS
               You speak English?

                              ATTENDANT
               Since I was three.

                              FERRIS
               Great. I want to you take extra special
               care of this vehicle, okay?

     He pats the Attendant on the arm. He smiles.

                              ATTENDANT
               Like it's a beautiful woman.

                              FERRIS
               I appreciate it.

     The Attendant very gingerly gets into the car. Ferris turns
     to Cameron. The Ferrari pulls into the lot very slowly, very
     carefully. No squealing tires, no revving engine.

                              FERRIS
               See what a finski can do to
               a person's attitude? He's going
               to treat it like a beautiful
               woman.

                              CAMERON
               Yeah, sure. Whip it with a stick
               and piss on the hood.

                              SLOANE
               Oh, please, Cameron. Do you have to
               be so graphic?

     She heads down the street.

                              SLOANE
               This is so right!

     Ferris nudges Cameron on. They exit the garage and head
     after Sloane. A long beat and the Ferrari creeps down the
     exit ramp of the garage. It's gone in the entrance and out
     the exit. Another attendant jumps in the passenger side.
     He's skinny, tall, with a huge knit hat willed with dreads.
     He lets out a spirited laugh and the Ferrari peels out of
     the lot. It heads down the street away from Sloane, Ferris
     and Cameron.

104  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE                                          104

     Joyce's care pulls in the driveway. She gets out and heads up
     the house.

105  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                           105

     It's dark. There's a figure in the bed. We hear soft
     snoring. A wire runs from under the bed covers to the closet
     door to the door to the room itself.

     INT. ROOM. DOOR KNOB

     The wire is tied to the doorknob. It's taut. Downstairs, we
     hear a door open and close.

106  INT. HOUSE. STAIRWAY                                        106

     Joyce quietly walks up the stairs.

107  INT. HOUSE. HALLWAY                                         107

     Joyce comes up the stairs and crosses to Ferris' room. She
     listens at the door. WE HEAR THE SNORING.

     CU. DOORKNOB

     Joyce slowly turns the doorknob and pushes the door open a
     crack.

     HER POV

     The door opens and the figure-like lump in the bed moves.

     CU. JOYCE

     She smiles and closes the door.

108  INT. ROOM. CLOSET                                           108

     The closet door is open. The wire from the bedroom door is
     strung over the top of the closet door. A trophy is attached
     to the end of the wire and it's resting on a yard stick. As
     the bedroom door closes, the trophy lifts up off the
     yardstick and the lump in the bed goes back down to it's
     original position.

     CU. FERRIS' SYNTHESIZER

     Little LED's are lighting up to the rhythm of the snoring.
     The snoring it simulated.

109  INT. HALLWAY                                                109

     Joyce listens at the door another beat. She's smiles with
     relief and affection.

110  EXT. SEARS TOWER. LATER                                     110

     HELICOPTER SHOT moves in on the world's tallest building. As
     it passes we see three figures pressed against the windows.

                              FERRIS (VO)
               This is the world's tallest building.
               From our vantage point here on the
               103 floor, we are provided with a
               view of four states.

                              CAMERON (VO)
               Do you think the car's alright?

                              FERRIS (VO)
               Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and
               my personal favorite, Indiana.

111  INT. SEARS TOWER OBSERVATION DECK                           111

     Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are standing against the window.

                              CAMERON
               I don't feel good, Ferris. Are
               we gonna stay long?

                              FERRIS
               Take a step back...

     Ferris steps back. Sloane and Cameron follow suit.

                              FERRIS
               Now, lean against the glass. Like
               this...

     He leans forward, putting all his weight on his forehead.

                              FERRIS
               And look down.

     Sloane leans forward. Cameron follows, reluctantly.

                              SLOANE
               Oh, shit!

     HER POV

     The street far, far below. A dizzying view.

     INT. OBSERVATION DECK

     The three are leaning against the glass.

                              SLOANE
               What if the glass gives?

                              FERRIS
               Death.

                              SLOANE
               Cool.

     CU. CAMERON

     He's looking down.

                              CAMERON
               I think I see my Dad.

112  EXT. STREET LEVEL                                           112

     A middle-aged man, Cameron's father, HORACE FRYE, is
     standing on the street corner. He's lean, clean, tough and
     humorless. He's wearing a puzzled look on his face.

                              CAMERON'S FATHER
               I think I see my car.

     HIS POV

     The Ferrari screams down the avenue and disappears down the
     underground ramp.

113  INT. SEARS TOWER LOBBY                                      113

     Ferris and Sloane bound down the escalator. Cameron follows
     glumly. They dance past the giant Calder mobile. They're
     singing.

                              FERRIS AND SLOANE
               I BEEN ALL 'ROUND THIS GREAT BIG WORLD
               AND I'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF GIRLS
               YEAH, BUT I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET
               BACK IN THE STATES
               BACK TO THE CUTEST GIRLS IN THE WORLD
               I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA
               I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA

114  EXT. STREET                                                 114

     Ferris and Sloane burst out the doors garnering the annoyed
     stares of the business people busily going in and out of the
     building. Cameron politely waits his turn to exit. Ferris
     and Sloane head down the street. Cameron follows.

                              FERRIS AND SLOANE
               I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA GIRLS!

115  EXT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE                            115

     Giant old monolith.

116  INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE. TRADING ROOM              116

     Traders are frantically buying and selling commodities.

117  INT. GALLERY                                                117

     Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are sitting in the gallery
     watching the proceedings.

                              SLOANE
               Do you love me?

                              FERRIS
               Do you love me?

                              SLOANE
               I asked you first.

                              FERRIS
               Yes. You?

                              SLOANE
               Yes.

                              FERRIS
               Would I trash a day of education to
               be with you if I didn't love you?

                              SLOANE
               Yes.

                              FERRIS
               Would I risk damaging a deep and
               wonderfully enriching relationship
               with my parents if I didn't love you?

                              SLOANE
               Yes.

                              FERRIS
               Would I have introduced you as my wife
               if I didn't love you?

                              SLOANE
               Wait a minute. That was a lie.

                              FERRIS
               True.

     Ferris puts his arm around Sloane.

                              FERRIS
               Would you want to get married? I
               mean if I wasn't an asshole.

                              SLOANE
               Sure.

                              FERRIS
                          (serious)
               Today?

     Sloane stares at him. Is he serious.

                              FERRIS
               I'm game.

                              SLOANE
               No way!

                              FERRIS
               I'll do it, if you will.

     Cameron suddenly adds his two cents.

                              CAMERON
               You need a blood test.

     Ferris looks around at him.

                              FERRIS
               Huh?

                              CAMERON
               If your blood's not compatible,
               you could produce a pinhead. The
               state requires a blood test.

                              FERRIS
               So?

                              CAMERON
               So, you can't get married today.

                              FERRIS
               Tomorrow?

                              CAMERON
               If you get a blood test today.

                              SLOANE
               I'm not getting married.

                              CAMERON
               I'm with you, babe.

                              FERRIS
               Why not?

                              SLOANE
               What do you mean, why not? Think
               about it.

                              FERRIS
               Besides being too young and your
               father hating my guts and not
               having any place to live and feeling
               awkward about being the only cheer-
               leader with a husband, give me a
               good reason why not.

                              CAMERON
               I'll give you two. My mother and
               father.

     Ferris and Sloane look at him curiously.

                              CAMERON
               They're married and they hate each other.
                          (to Ferris)
               You've seen them. Am I right?

                              FERRIS
               You're father's a toad and your
               Mom's always wired out, but so what?
               They're old. That's natural.

                              CAMERON
               It makes me puke. Seeing people
               treat each other like that. It's
               like the car. He loves the car.
               He hates his wife.

                              SLOANE
               My parents are divorced. So what?
               It's not like it doesn't happen
               ten thousand times a day.

                              CAMERON
               Just because it happens doesn't
               make it right. Are you comfortable
               with it?

                              SLOANE
               No. It's not something I can get comfortable
               with. I've tried. Are yours divorced?

                              CAMERON
               They may as well be.

                              SLOANE
               Do you think they're staying together
               because of you?

     Cameron hasn't seen it that way. He shrugs.

                              SLOANE
               Do they like you?

     It hasn't occured to Cameron that his parents might not like
     him. That parental love might not be a given.

                              CAMERON
               Yeah. Sure.

                              SLOANE
               Consider this...my father canned me
               and my brother and my Mom for a
               twenty five year old dipso with fake
               tits. He dropped us like a rock. Everything
               was cool at our house. I thought so.
               We all thought so. Then BLAM! It's over.

                              FERRIS
                          (to CAMERA)
               This is all news to me. She keeps a
               pretty good secret.

                              SLOANE
                          (to Cameron)
               It was pure selfishness. When I have
               a kid, I don't care how much I want
               something, if it's gonna screw-up the
               kid, forget it.

                              FERRIS
                          (to CAMERA)
               She's not lying.

                              CAMERON
               You could change.

                              SLOANE
               Yeah. But I'm gonna try not to.
               I'm gonna think about it. I'm
               gonna try to prevent it.

                              FERRIS
               This is optomism. It's a common
               trait with my age group. Adults
               think it's cute, it's like a charming
               quick that infests youth. But it's
               a cool thing and I think, deep down,
               crusty old shits wish they had some.
               They wish they had her, too.
                          (points to Sloane)
               Sorry. She's taken.

                              CAMERON
               I'd rather not have my family break
               apart, thank you.

                              SLOANE
               Well, you know what? It ain't up
               to you. It's out of your hands.

                              CAMERON
               So, I in other words, I should just
               sit back and watch it crumble?

                              SLOANE
               You're merely an inhabitant in their
               universe.

                              FERRIS
               Frightening choice of words.

                              SLOANE
               They call the shots. When you split
               from them, you call the shots.

                              CAMERON
               So, you're saying I should run away?

                              FERRIS
               No. She's saying it's time for lunch.

                              SLOANE
               What?

                              FERRIS
               Let's go feed Cameron.

     They stand up and head out. Ferris hangs back a moment. He
     cups his hands to his mouth. He yells at the top of his
     voice.

                              FERRIS
               BUY!

     And he exits. Cool and casual.

118  INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE.  TRADING FLOOR            118

     It explodes with activity in response to Ferris' shout.
     We HEAR A RADIO ANNOUNCER.

                              ANNOUNCER
               Commodity prices rose sharply today
               in unusually heavy trading...

119  EXT. RESTAURANT                                             119

     A French restaurant on the Gold Coast.  It's noon.

120  INT. RESTAURANT                                             120

     Ferris, Sloane and Cameron are standing in the restaurant.
     Ferris is looking at the maitre 'd's reservations book.

     HIS POV

     His fingers runs down to a party of three for 12:00.

     INT. RESTAURANT

     The maitre'd returns.

                              MAITRE'D
                          (to Ferris)
               May I help you?

                              FERRIS
               Yes. I'm Abe Frohman. Party of
               three for 12:00.

     The maitre'd looks at Ferris curiously.

                              FERRIS
               Is there a problem?

                              MAITRE'D
               You're Abe Frohman?

                              FERRIS
               I'm Abe Frohman.

                              MAITRE'D
                          (chuckles)
               I'm sorry, son. I'm very busy right
               now. If you have trouble finding the
               door...

     Sloane tugs Ferris' sleeve. He ignores her.

                              FERRIS
               Are you suggesting that I'm not
               who I say I am?

                              MAITRE'D
               Shall I call the police?

                              CAMERON
               Let's go...Abe.

                              FERRIS
               I'm not going anywhere.
                          (to the Maitre'd)
               Call the police. Go ahead. Better
               yet...
                          (grabs the phone)
               ...I'll call myself.

     Cameron chokes. Sloane grits her teeth. The maitre'd smiles
     smuggly.

     CU. PHONE

     Ferris punches out a number. A beat and the restaurant's
     second line lights up and the phone rings.

     INT. RESTAURANT

     The maitre'd motions for the phone so that he can answer the
     call. Ferris waves him off angrily.

                              FERRIS
               You touch me and I yell "rat!"
               There's another phone around here.
               Find it.

     The maitre'd backs off.

                              CAMERON
               Ferris, let's split, please?

                              SLOANE
               Cameron's right. We're gonna
               get busted.

                              FERRIS
               Not a chance in the world.

     He hands the phone to Sloane.

                              FERRIS
               Ask for Abe Frohman.

     INT. RESTAURANT. LATER

     Ferris, Sloane and Cameron are seated in the restaurant. The
     maitre'd is hovering over Ferris.

                              MAITRE'D
               I appreciate your understanding.

                              FERRIS
               Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave
               us to our repast and all will be
               forgotten.

                              MAITRE'D
               Enjoy your luncheon.

                              FERRIS
               Thank you.

     The maitre'd backs away. Ferris smiles. Sloane is impressed.
     Cameron is flushed with nerves.

                              FERRIS
               Darling, you were wonderful.

                              SLOANE
               Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, dear friend?

     Cameron looks to Ferris.

                              FERRIS
               And you thought we wouldn't have
               any fun. Shame on you.

     Ferris disappears behind his menu.

121  EXT. SCHOOL                                                 121

     We HEAR HALLWAY SOUNDS AND JEANIE.

                              JEANIE (VO)
               Ferris Bueller's days are numbered.

122  INT. GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM                                     122

     Jeanie's sitting on a bench in a field hockey uniform. She's
     talking to a FRIEND.

                              JEANIE
                          (mean, vicious)
               I'm gonna bust his buns.

                              FRIEND
               Why? What's the point?

                              JEANIE
               Why? Because I'm sick of the little
               dope. He manipulates my parents, he
               does whatever he wants, whenever he
               wants and he never gets nailed.
                          (wicked pause)
               Well, babe, today I'm the hammer.

     She yanks angrily on the velcro strap on her sneakers. The
     straps rip off in her hand.

                              FRIEND
               I think he's cute.

                              JEANIE
               Sweetie, it's an established fact that
               you have no taste. Ferris is not cute.
               He's not charming. He's not nice. He's
               not a wonderful person. He's an ignorant
               mule and the sooner everybody in this
               school comes to that realization the
               better off we'll all be.

     She displays the velcro straps to her friend.

                              JEANIE
               See? My brother strokes you, you
               sympathize with him, I get pissed
               off and this is what happens!

     Jeanie tosses the straps on the floor.

                              JEANIE
               Let me tell you something. I study
               hard, I work hard, I'm polite, I'm
               considerate, I'm friendly and fair
               to all kinds of people. Except
               morons. I try to be everything a
               good, decent person should be and
               you know what?

                              FRIEND
               Everybody thinks you're an asshole.

     Jeanie freezes with her next sentence pinned to her tongue.

                              JEANIE
               Excuse me?

                              FRIEND
               I don't think you're an asshole.

                              JEANIE
               Who does?

     Her friend smiles sheepishly.

                              JEANIE
               Rachel?

     Jeanie's friend shrugs, wags her head, does everything but
     verbally confirm.

                              JEANIE
               Rachel's a dirt bag. Who else?

                              FRIEND
               I don't know. Just forget it.

                              JEANIE
               Forget that everybody thinks I'm an
               asshole? Would you like everybody to
               think you're an asshole?

                              FRIEND
               Not everybody thinks you're an
               asshole. Mr. Rooney likes you.

                              JEANIE
               Oh, hey. That's exciting. A fat
               fifty year old clod with B.O.
               likes me.

     Jeanie shakes her head in disbelief.

                              JEANIE
               Would everybody be happier if
               maybe I were to die in a flaming
               car accident or something?

                              FRIEND
               Maybe if you didn't cat like and
               asshole...

                              JEANIE
               Am I acting like an asshole?

                              FRIEND
               I didn't mean it that way.

                              JEANIE
               I this a conspiracy to shit all
               over me or something? Is my brother
               behind this? Tell me if he is or I'll
               sock your tits.

                              FRIEND
               You really do have a problem, Jeanie.

                              JEANIE
               Me? I have a problem?

                              FRIEND
               Somebody who threatens to sock people's
               tits has a problem.

                              JEANIE
               Alright. How about if I sock your
               face?

     Jeanie's friend gets up.

                              FRIEND
               Take a walk, Jeanie.

     Her friend exits.

                              JEANIE
                          (yells after her)
               If it means anything to you, I
               have my period! MY BODY'S RIDDING
               ITSELF OF OLD EGGS, GODDAMN IT!

     She snarls and slumps against the lockers.

                              JEANIE
               He's gone. He's over. He's monkey meat.

123  INT. MEN'S ROOM. CHEZ PAUL                                  123

     Ferris is standing at the urinal.

                              FERRIS
               She's a person who views life as
               an ordeal that must be endured. Her
               body is a transport vehicle for her
               anger. I don't know where she gets
               this shit. Basically, the family's
               pretty cool.

     He looks down at the urinal.

                              FERRIS
               I wonder if everybody shoots at
               cigarette butts in urinals? Probably
               not many women.
                          (continues)
               I used to think that my family was
               the only one that had weirdness
               in it. It used to worry me. Then I
               met Cameron and I saw how his
               family functioned.

     He zips this trousers and steps away from the urinal.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron's home life is really shit.
               He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick
               all the time. It really upsets him.
               What he said about his parents hating
               each other? I refuse to sleep over at
               his house. His parents fight all the
               time. Even when I'm there. Is there
               anything worse than being at somebody's
               house when their parents are fighting?
               It's the absolute height of social
               discomfort.

     He checks his hair in the mirror.

                              FERRIS
               When they go after each other, Cameron
               tightens up. It's scary. He gets so
               wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns
               apart with a crowbar. The thing with
               taking his old man's car? It's good
               for him. It teaches him to deal with
               his fear. Plus, and I must
               be honest here, I love driving it.
               I highly recommend picking one up.

     He exists the men's room. We hold a beat. A toilet flushes.
     Another beat and Tom walks out of the stall. He crosses to
     the sink.

124  INT. RESTAURANT                                             124

     Cameron and Sloane have been served their lunches. They're
     staring at the plates.

                              CAMERON
               What is it?

                              SLOANE
               I don't know. But it looks like
               it's already been eaten and digested.

                              CAMERON
               I knew it was a mistake letting
               Ferris order for us.

     Ferris slides over to the table and drops into his seat.

                              FERRIS
               What are you doing?

     Cameron looks at Ferris.

                              CAMERON
               What is this shit?

                              FERRIS
               You got me. I don't speak French.

     He puts his napkin in his lap and smells his plate.

                              FERRIS
               I think it's a land-based beefoid
               creature.

     He takes a bite. He savors the taste.

                              FERRIS
               Splendid.

                              CAMERON
               Really?

                              FERRIS
               Superb.

     Cameron and Sloane try theirs. They chew tentatively.

                              FERRIS
               Good?

     Sloane and Cameron shrug. It's not bad. A WAITER passes.
     Ferris stops him.

                              FERRIS
               Yo, Clouseau!

     The waiter stops and looks at Ferris indignantly.

                              FERRIS
               I have a growth on my brain that
               causes memory lapses. Could you
               tell me what we ordered here?

     The waiter glances at the plates.

                              WAITER
               Sweetbreads.

                              FERRIS
               Uh, huh. And what might that be?

                              WAITER
               Pancreas.

                              FERRIS
               As in the gland that has important
               functions in digestion and metabolism?

     CU. SLOANE AND CAMERON

     They stop chewing. They're holding their sweetbreads in their
     mouths.

     CU. FERRIS

     He continues his questioning.

                              FERRIS
               ...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid
               containing digestive enzymes? The home
               of the world famous isles of Langerhans?

     CU. WAITER

     He nods broadly, knowing that he's spoiling the kids' meal.

     CU. SLOANE AND CAMERON

     They look at each other.

     CU. FERRIS

     He pats his mouth with his napkin. He looks to Cameron and
     Sloane. He raises a finger, holds it a beat and gives a cue.

     CU. WAITER

     He turns away as Sloane and Cameron spit out their food.

     CU. FERRIS

     He watches Sloane and Cameron then glances at the waiter.

                              FERRIS
               Check, please!

125  EXT. RESTAURANT                                             125

     Tom and his two GUESTS are standing at the curb, talking. A
     cab is waiting. The door's open. In the B.G. Ferris, Sloane
     and Cameron come out of the restaurant. They approach the
     cab. Tom's back it to Ferris. Ferris stops cold.

     FERRIS, SLOANE, CAMERON

     They turns on cue at Tom, now in the B.G., turns toward the
     restaurant.

                              FERRIS
               40,000 restaurants in the downtown
               area and I pick the one my father
               goes to.

                              CAMERON
               We're gonna get nabbed, for sure.

                              FERRIS
               No way, Cameron. Only the meek
               get nabbed. The bold survive.
               Let's go.

     He turns to the cab. Sloane and Cameron turn slowly.

     EXT. STREET. CAB

     Tom and his party are still jawing at curbside. Ferris,
     Sloane and Cameron slowly approach the cab. Behind the backs
     of the men, Ferris scoots Sloane into the cab. Cameron
     dashes in. The Ferris hops the cab.

     INT. CAB

     Ferris slams the door.

     CU. CAB DOOR HANDLE

     A man's hand reaches for the handle as the cab pulls away.

     EXT. RESTAURANT

     Tom and his guests watch in bewilderment at their cab takes
     off. MUSIC COMES UP.

126  EXT. MUSEUM OR SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY                         126

     The grand old Chicago museum.

127  INT. MUSEUM. OVERHEAD SHOT                                  127

     The main gallery is crowded with school kids.

     INT. MUSEUM. FLOOR

     A class of kids walking along holding hands. Among the
     second graders are Ferris, Sloane and Cameron, holding hands
     looking like giant grade schoolers.

     INT. MUSEUM. DISPLAY CASE

     Baby chicks are hatching in a huge, round incubator. Sloane,
     Ferris and Cameron are intently watching the process.

     Sloane operates a metal press to produce a tin ashtray.

     INT. MUSEUM. HEART REPLICA

     A giant, walk-thru replica of a human heart. Ferris staggers
     out of it, clutching his heart, feigning a massive heart
     attack.

     INT. GERMAN U-BOAT

     Ferris is examining the controls of the captured U-Boat. He
     checks to see if he's being watched then he presses a button
     and pulls a lever.

     CU. PROPELLER

     For the first time in forty years, the screw turns.

     CU. HUMAN FETUS IN A BOTTLE

     The famous stages of life display which features bottled
     fetuses. The ninth month. A tiny human being in a jar.

     CU. SLOANE, FERRIS, CAMERON

     Sloane wants to cry. Cameron's stomach is in his throat.
     Ferris is lost in thought. The MUSIC ENDS.

                              SLOANE
                          (remorsefully)
               I wonder if he has a name?

                              FERRIS
                          (blank)
               Ninth Month.

128  EXT. CHICAGO RIVER. LONG, HIGH SHOT                        128

     From the Merchandise Mart, looking down the fetid, green
     swath of water. A boat is rolling up the man-made canyon.

                              CAMERON (VO)
               Are you guys worried about nuclear war?

                              FERRIS (VO)
               Cameron, it's a beautiful day, we've
               won our freedom, we're traveling down
               one of American's most scenic polluted
               waterways and you have to bring up
               nuclear war?

                              SLOANE (VO)
               It is kind of raggy subject, Cam.

                              CAMERON (VO)
               Regardless. It's with us every day.
               The possiblity of global destruction.

                              SLOANE (VO)
               Don't you think it's an issue because
               people need something to worry about?
               They have to like, have some major
               problem that puts all their little
               bullshit into some kind of persepective?

                              CAMERON (VO)
               Maybe.

                              FERRIS
               They used to have Viet Nam. They
               used to have the oil crisis stuff
               and Iran. That's over and people
               have to have their big issue. It's
               not like somebody came up with the
               nuclear holocaust yesterday at
               noon, you know.

                              SLOANE (VO)
               To answer your question...No, I'm not
               worried about it at all.

                              FERRIS (VO)
               We don't know when the bombs going
               off. We do know, however, that college
               starts in the fall.

                              CAMERON (VO)
                          (dramatic, deadly serious)
               Do you know what a nuclear winter is?

     Long beat.

                              SLOANE (VO)
               Yeah. Everybody's dead, it's real
               cold and the skiing's for shit.

     The boat makes the turn in the river and CLEARS FRAME.

     EXT. BOAT DOCK

     The three are sitting on the aft deck of the tour boat.
     Their feet are up on the railing. Very casual, very relaxed.
     Discussing the end of the world.

                              SLOANE
               My step-father's always going off about
               how when he was young he was committed to
               all these causes.

                              FERRIS
               He's full of shit. All the old hippies
               are full of shit.

                              SLOANE
               He says I don't care about things like
               he did.

                              FERRIS
               What's he care about now?

                              SLOANE
               Baldness, fatty meats and money.

                              FERRIS
               I rest my case.

                              CAMERON
               What's spooky is they still control
               everything. They took over when they
               were young and they never gave it up.

                              FERRIS
               One of the most frightening experiences
               of my young life has been observing
               my parents and our neighbors playing
               the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits.
               It's chilling to see people crazed with
               the minutia of their past.

                              CAMERON
               It's human nature to like what you had
               better than what you have.

                              SLOANE
               Agreed.

     A loud speaker on the boat identifies a point of interest.

                              LOUDSPEAKER
               TO YOUR LEFT IT THE WORLD'S TALLEST
               BUILDING...

     The three look to the left.

                              LOUDSPEAKER, FERRIS,
                              SLOANE, CAMERON
               The Sears Tower.

                              CAMERON
               You know, this is all very interesting
               but I'm starving.

                              FERRIS
               An hour ago you wanted to yack.

                              CAMERON
               I feel better now.

                              FERRIS
               Lean over and grab a fish.

     Cameron looks over the side of the boat. An obtuse thought
     flashes through Sloane's brain.

                              SLOANE
               What comes after a nuclear winter?

                              FERRIS
               Nuclear spring.

129  EXT. SCHOOL                                                 129

     Meanwhile...

130  INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DEAN'S OFFICE                      130

     Jeanie is having a small moral debate with herself.

                              JEANIE
               It's reprehensible to squeal on
               your own flesh and blood...but it's
               for his own good. His cavalier
               attitude will get him into trouble
               later in life...and it'll continue
               to piss me off and I'll get so
               wadded-up that it'll cause cervex cancer
               and he'll ruin my life. Screw him.

     She slips into the Dean's outer office.

131  INT. DEAN'S OUTER OFFICE                                    131

     Rooney's secretary is behind her desk. Jeanie walks in. The
     secretary looks up and greets her with a weary smile.

                              SECRETARY
               Hello, Jeanie. Who's bothering
               you now?

     Jeanie scowls at her.

                              JEANIE
               Is Dean Rooney in?

                              SECRETARY
               I'm sorry, he's out. Can I help you?

                              JEANIE
                          (condescending)
               I seriously doubt it. When's he back?

                              SECRETARY
               I don't know. He left the grounds
               on personal business.

132  EXT. STREET. CU. CURB                                       132

     A car tire rolls into FRAME and stops. Slide across to the
     sidewalk. Rooney's dress shoe steps out onto the pavement.
     Move up to reveal Rooney standing at the door of his
     bile-green LeBaron. Rooney peels off his shades and looks
     around like he's Dirty Harry. In his mind he is Dirty Harry.

     CU. FIRE HYDRANT

     Rooney's dres shoe on the hydrant. He ties his lace and
     pulls up his sock.

     EXT. STREET

     Rooney straightens his tie and jacket and slips into a rowdy
     hot dog joint.

133  INT. HOT DOG STAND                                          133

     It's jammed with construction workers, secretaries, suburban
     businessmen. It's loud and confusing. Rooney pushes his way
     in and scopes the crowd.

     HIS POV

     A young person is playing a video game in a far corner.

     CU. ROONEY

     He suspects it's Ferris. It look sort of like Ferris. He
     smiles and cuts into the crowd.

     CU. THE BACK OF THE VIDEO PLAYER'S HEAD

     MOVE IN on the player.

                              ROONEY (OC)
               I've been waiting a long time
               for this.

     The player looks up.

                              ROONEY (OC)
               Your ass is mine.

     The player turns around. It's a GIRL.

     CU. ROONEY

     The blood evacuates his face. He stares at the girl.

     CU. GIRL

     She stares at him. She picks up her Coke. She puts the straw
     to her lips and sucks.

     CU. ROONEY

     He's still staring. He can't think of anything to say.

     CU. GIRL

     Holding the straw in the mouth, she draws it out of the cup.
     She raises it, pointing it directly in Rooney's face.

     CU. ROONEY

     He squints

     CU. GIRL

     She blows a strawful of Coke in Rooney's face.

     CU. NAPKIN HOLDER

     A hand yanks a napkin hold.

     INT. HOT DOG STAND. SERVICE COUNTER

     Rooney wipes his face. Behind him is the kitchen and a
     grease-covered TV set broadcasting a Cubs baseball game.
     There's a long foul ball. The TV camera follows the ball
     into the stands. A kid makes a stab at the ball. Rooney
     wipes his suit off. The TV camera zooms in on the boy
     triumphantly holding the foul ball aloft. It's Ferris.
     He does a little celebration dance. Rooney wads up the
     napkin and tosses it in a trashbin. The TV camera returns to
     the game. Rooney glances at the screen.

                              ROONEY
               What's the score?

                              HOT DOG MAN
               Zero to zero.

                              ROONEY
               Who's winning?

                              HOT DOG MAN
               Cubs.

     Rooney nods and exits.

134  EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD. STANDS                                  134

     Ferris sits down with the baseball. He shakes his stinging
     paw. On either side of him are Cameron and Sloane. Cameron's
     scarfing nachos.

                              FERRIS
               I think I broke my thumb.

                              SLOANE
               Can we leave now?

                              FERRIS
               You want to leave? We just got here.

                              SLOANE
               You got a call, you broke your thumb,
               what's left to do?

     Cameron offers his nachos to Sloane. She looks at them with
     disgust.

                              SLOANE
               No wonder you're always sick.

     Ferris leans back, puts his hands behind his head and turns
     his face to the bright sun.

                              FERRIS
               Do you realize that if I played by
               the rules, right now I'd be in gym?

135  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. PLAYING FIELD                             135

     A boy's gym class is doing laps. A blue Fiat pulls into the
     shot.

136  INT. FIAT                                                   136

     Jeanie's at the wheel. She sneaks a glance at the school.

                              JEANIE
               I can't believe my brother's making
               me put myself in a position where I
               could get expelled. Selfish little
               moron.
                          (pause)
               Ferris? You're overshadowed
               me long enough. I'm gonna get
               you, buddy.

     She puts the car in gear and drives out of the shot.

137  EXT. STATE STREET                                           137

     A parade is underway. Floats and politicians. Marching
     bands, drum and bugle corps, soldiers, school kids. Figure
     skating club in outfits and skates performing their routines
     on pavement. It's GERMAN-AMERICAN APPRECIATION DAY.

     EXT. STATE STREET. FLOAT

     Riding atop on a float is Ferris. He's waving to the crowd.
     He and half a dozen homely German-American Beauty Queens.
     He's leading the girls in singing, "DANKE SHOEN".

     EXT. STATE STREET. SLOANE AND CAMERON

     They're watching Ferris go by. They wave to him.

                              SLOANE
               I love him.

                              CAMERON
               It's hard not to.

     Cameron breaks a smile. As worried as he is about the day
     and getting caught, he has to admire Ferris for his lack of
     inhabitions. Cameron mumbles a few words.

                              CAMERON
               Stop...water...want...

                              SLOANE
               Do you believe in reincarnation?

                              CAMERON
               Huh?

                              SLOANE
               Do you believe that you lived before?

                              CAMERON
               Yeah. Sort of.

                              SLOANE
               DO you ever wonder what you were?

                              CAMERON
               I don't have to wonder. I know.

     Sloane looks at him with amazement.

                              CAMERON
               I was a tractor tire.

     EXT. STATE STREET. FLOAT

     Ferris is on his knees, reaching down from the float,
     shaking hands with people in the crowd.

                              FERRIS
               Guten tag, dude!

     EXT. STATE STREET

     Sloane and Cameron continue their conversation.

                              CAMERON
               What were you in a previous life?

                              SLOANE
               I'm not sure but I think I know
               who Ferris was.

                              CAMERON
               Hannibal.

                              SLOANE
               From the A-Team?

                              CAMERON
               No. The guy who rode the elephants
               into Switzerland.

     Sloane laughs at herself. They step out of the crowd and
     head down the street in the direction the parade's heading.

                              SLOANE
               I think if he was anybody, he
               was Magellan. You know, the guy
               who went around the world.

     Cameron nods.

                              SLOANE
               I could see him ignoring popular
               belief and taking off on some
               impossible mission.

                              CAMERON
               Yeah. As long as I've known him,
               everything works for him. There's
               nothing he can't handle. I can't
               handle anything. School, parents,
               the future. Ferris can do anything.

     EXT. STATE STREET. FLOAT

     Ferris is playing "TWIST AND SHOUT" on the accordian. The
     girls on the float are singing.

                              FERRIS
               WELL, SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW!

                              GIRLS
               SHAKE IT UP, BABY

                              FERRIS
               TWIST AND SHOUT!

                              GIRLS
               TWIST AND SHOUT!

                              FERRIS
               COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, BABY ON!
               COME ON AND WORK IT ON OUT!

                              GIRLS
               WORK IT ON OUT!

     EXT. STREET. SLOANE AND CAMERON

     They continue their conversation.

                              SLOANE
               The future's worse for a boy, isn't
               it?

     Cameron doesn't understand what she means.

                              SLOANE
               A girl can always bail out and
               have a baby and get some guy
               to support her.

                              CAMERON
               That's a pretty grim thought.

                              SLOANE
               True, but it's an option. No options
               is worse.

                              CAMERON
               I don't know what I'm gonna do.

                              SLOANE
               College.

                              CAMERON
               Yeah, but to do what?

                              SLOANE
               What are you interested in?

                              CAMERON
               Nothing.

                              SLOANE
               Me either.

     They walk on for a few beats. We HEAR "TWIST AND SHOUT"
     GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER. The sons is taking over all the
     other tunes in the band. It's infecting the entire parade.

                              CAMERON
               What do you think Ferris is gonna
               do?

     EXT. STATE STREET. MARCHING BAND

     EXT. STREET. CHOIR GROUP

     They're marching down the parade. They're singing in their
     angleic voices.

               AND LET ME KNOW THAT YOU'RE MINE!

     EXT. STREET. STREET CLEANERS

     With their brooms ready...

                              STREET CLEANERS
               KNOW THAT YOU'RE MINE!

     EXT. STREET. DECK

     The entire parade is singing and playing "TWIST AND SHOUT".

     EXT. STREET. VIEWING STAND

     The POLITICIANS and their WIVES stand up.

                              POLITICIANS AND WIVES

                              FERRIS
               AH!

     EXT. STREET. WIDE AND HIGH

     The entire parade is at frenzy pitch.

                              PARADE
               AHHHHH!

     The SOUND OF THE VOICES blends with the SOUND OF A RED-LINED
     HIGH PERFORMANCE ENGINE.

138  EXT. CALUMET CITY                                           138

     The Port of Chicago. Grim, gritty waterfront. Suddenly,
     Cameron's father's car flies OVER CAMERA. Like the opening
     shot in Star Wars. The Starship Ferrari. SLO-MO.

     CU. FERRARI UNDER-CARRIAGE

     It travels past to reveal a beautiful blue sky. SLO-MO.

     CU. PARKING ATTENDANT

     His eyes are wide with exhilaration. Mouth open, tongue out.
     Maniac at the wheel. SLO-MO.

     CU. RASTAMAN

     His eyes are closed. Big smile. SLO-MO,

     EXT. STREETS. KIDS

     They're looking up in the air, following the car as it flies
     over them. Broad, excited smiles. The car's shadow passes
     over them. SLO-MO.

139  CU. CAR GRILLE                                              139

     It fills the frame and stops. We MOVE UP to reveal Rooney
     behind the wheel of his car.

     EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE

     Rooney gets out of his car. He looks at the house, looks up
     and down the street, then crosses to Ferris' house.

140  INT. HOUSE. FOYER                                           140

     Rooney's at the front door. We see him peek in a window at
     the top of the door. The doorbell rings.

141  INT. HOUSE. FERRIS' ROOM. COMPUTER                          141

     It acknowledges the doorbell.

     CU. CASSETTE PLAYER

     It clicks on.

142  EXT. HOUSE. FRONT PORCH                                     142

     The house intercom activates. We HEAR FERRIS' VOICE.

                              FERRIS
               Who is it?

     Rooney presses the intercom.

                              ROONEY
               This is Ed Rooney, Ferris. I'd
               like to have a word with you.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'm sorry I can't come to the door
               right now. I'm very ill and I'm
               afraid that in my weakened condition,
               I could take a nasty spill down the
               stairs and subject myself to further
               school absenses.

     There's a pause. Rooney presses the intercom again.

                              ROONEY
               B.S. Come down here.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               You can reach my parents at their
               places of business. Thank you for
               stopping by. I appreciate your concern
               for my well-being. It will be remembered
               long after this illness has past.

     His voice clicks off. Rooney presses the intercom again.

                              ROONEY
               I'm not leaving until you come
               down and talk to me.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Have a nice day.

     Rooney presses the intercom.

                              ROONEY
               I'm not leaving, Ferris.

     There's no response. Rooney rings the doorbell again. The
     pre-recorded litany starts over.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Who is it?

     Rooney doesn't realize that he's listening to a recording.

                              ROONEY
               Don't get smart with me Ferris!

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'm sorry I can't come to the door
               right now. I'm very ill and I'm
               afraid that in my weakened condition...

     Rooney leans back from the door. He can't quite figure out
     what's going on. But's it's highly suspicious.

143  INT. HOUSE. LIVING ROOM                                     143

     Rooney steps through the hedges and peeks in the windows. We
     HEAR FERRIS' VOICE inside.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               You may reach my parents at their
               places of business.

144  INT. HOUSE. KITCHEN                                         144

     Rooney tries to peak in the kitchen window.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I appreciate your conern for my
               well-being. It will be remembered
               long after...

145  EXT. HOUSE. BACKDOOR                                        145

     A black rubber doggie door. The type that allows a dog to
     come and go as it pleases. Rooney is crouched down. He lifts
     the doggie door and peeks in the house.

     HIS POV

     Along the kitchen floor. Through the kitchen, into the
     dining room. We hear a LARGE DOG GROWL.

     CU. ROONEY

     He's peaking through the door. He hears the dog. His face
     freezes.

                              FERRIS
               Have a nice day.

     EXT. HOUSE. DOGGIE DOOR

     A Rottweiler bursts through the doggie door in a fury of
     gnashing teeth and foam.

146  CU. LARGE BREASTS                                           146

     Tassled pasties twirl like airplane propellers.

     CU. CAMERON, FERRIS AND SLOANE

     They're sitting in a booth in the garish, nearly deserted
     strip joint. Cameron's mouth is open in amazement. Sloane is
     embarrassed and revolted.

                              CAMERON
               How does she do that? One goes
               one way, one goes the other.

                              FERRIS
               She's probably schizophrenic.

                              SLOANE
               Ferris, this is nauseating me.
               Really. I'm losing respect for
               you by the bucket.

                              FERRIS
               You don't think it's amazing that
               we got in?

                              SLOANE
               Who wants to get in?

                              FERRIS
               Cameron looks like a toddler, for
               Christ's sake. I'm talking about
               a major achievement in false
               identification.

                              SLOANE
               I'm not interested in watching
               someone jiggle their mammary glands.

                              FERRIS
               Point well taken. But consider why
               she does it. Why she does it and
               you don't.

                              SLOANE
               I'm not a tramp.

                              FERRIS
               Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she
               lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend.
               A parent. A child...
                          (to CAMERA)
               This kind of thing makes me a little
               depressed. You may think because I'm
               the age I am that I'm a sex maniac.
               That sex is all I think about.
               But that's not true. I'm a romantic.
               I think alot of people my age are.
               We think about love and matters of
               the heart. And SAT scores and acne
               aside, we worry about lonliness. It's
               a terrible thing. And we feel it. I
               feel it.

     He flips his collar up, curls his lip and affects an Elvis
     impression. A sappy, do-wop track FADES UP. The club lights
     go down. Cameron and Sloane disappear into darkness. Ferris
     stands up from the booth. He strolls slowly through the
     empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of
     blue light.

                              FERRIS
               You know, someone said the world's a
               stage and each must play a part.
               Fate had me playing in love, with you
               as my sweetheart. Act one was when we
               met. I loved you at first glance. You
               read your lines so cleverly and never
               missed a cue. Then came act two. You
               seemed to change. You acted strange.
               And why, I've never known.

     He climbs up on the little runway. The stripper disappears
     in darkness as Ferris takes over the spotlight.

                              FERRIS
               Honey, you lies when you said you
               loved me and I had no cause to
               doubt you. But I'd rather go on
               hearing your lies than to go on
               living without you. Now, the stage
               is bare and I'm standing there with
               emptiness all around and if you won't
               come back to me, then they can bring
               the curtain down...

     Elvis fades up. The orignal recording. Ferris lip synchs
     with the big, dramatic florish that was the King's trademark
     ballad sign-off.

                              ELVIS
               IS YOUR HEART FILLED WITH PAIN?
               SHALL I COME BACK AGAIN?
               TELL ME DEAR, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?

     Ferris drops his head. Like the King would.

147  EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET. CAMERON'S CAR                         147

     Cameron's father is looking at the car. He's studying it. It
     looks terribly familiar. He leans into the open car and
     reaches for the glovebox to see if the contents will confirm
     if it's his. He freezes. He looks up slowly.

     HIS POV

     The Attendant and the Rastaman are glowering at him. They're
     holding bags of fried chicken.

                              ATTENDANT
               You looking for something in my
               car?

     CU. CAMERON'S FATHER

     He shakes his head, no.

                              CAMERON'S FATHER
               No.

148  EXT. FERRIS' TOWN. JEANIE                                   148

     Jeanie's standing at her car. She's staring incredulously
     into the distance. Her mouth's open. She's shaking her head
     slowly.

     HER POV

     Spray-painted on the town water tower in gigantic black
     letters -- SAVE FERRIS BUELLER.

     CU. JEANIE

     She's furious.

                              JEANIE
               I'm gonna microwave his nuts...

149  EXT. MICHIGAN AVENUE                                        149

     Afternoon traffic.

150  INT. TAXI CAB                                               150

     Ferris, Sloane and Cameron in the backseat of a checker.
     Ferris is on one window, Cameron on the other. Sloane's in
     the middle. Ferris is talking to the DRIVER.

                              FERRIS
               So...

     He leans forward and reads the driver's name off the city
     license.

                              FERRIS
               So, Yuri, how long have you been
               in America?

                              DRIVER
               One year.

                              FERRIS
               What's your overall impression?

                              DRIVER
               It's very good here.

                              FERRIS
               Better than Russia?

                              DRIVER
               Much better here than in Russia.

                              FERRIS
               Clearly you've never been to an
               American high school.

     Ferris sits back. He puts his arm around Sloane.

                              CAMERON
               It's getting late, Ferris. I have
               to get the car home. I know you
               don't care, but it means my ass.

                              FERRIS
               You think I don't care?

                              CAMERON
               I know you don't care.

                              FERRIS
               That hurts, Cameron.

                              SLOANE
               Jump back, Ferris, Cameron's been
               a good sport.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, what'd you see today?

     Cameron looks at him.

                              FERRIS
               You saw four states, a submarine,
               a giant heart, seventy five dollars
               worth of cooked pancreas, two of the
               most incredible breasts ever to come
               out of modern plastics, major
               league baseball and...
                          (quizical look)
               Are you gonna chuck your nachos?

     Cameron's staring past Ferris. He's frozen. Ferris realizes
     he's looking at something out the window. He turns. He
     freezes.

     HIS POV

     In the gridlock traffic, their cab is squeezed tight
     alongside another cab. In that cab is Tom. He's about a foot
     from Ferris. He turns and looks right into CAMERA.

     TOM'S POV

     Ferris' frozen face.

     FERRIS' POV

     Tom glances back at his paper. He pauses. Looks up. Thinks.
     Turns back to CAMERA.

     TOM'S POV

     Sloane is sitting where Ferris was. She's wearing
     sunglasses, looking bored. She turns and glances out the
     window. Fakes a yawn.

     HER POV

     Tom stares at her. He's baffled. He looks away.

     INT. CAB. FLOOR.

     Cameron and Ferris are on the floor. On their asses, with
     their backs to the back of the front seat, feet up on the
     seat.

                              FERRIS
                          (to Sloane)
               What's he doing?

                              SLOANE
                          (revolted)
               He's looking at me and he's licking
               the glass and making obscene gestures
               with his hands.

                              FERRIS
               What?!

     Sloane bursts out laughing.

                              SLOANE
               Roast!

     She licks her finger and touches Ferris knee. She makes a
     sizzling sound. She collapes on the seat in hysterics.

     INT. TOM'S CAB

     Tom's looking into Ferris' cab.

     HIS POV

     Sloane's bouncing up and down.

     CU. TOM

     He can't quite figure out what's going on. He turns and
     slowly raises his newspaper over his face. We see on the
     back of the paper a small story with the headline: COMMUNITY
     RALLIES AROUND SICK YOUTH.

151  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE. BACKYARD. DOG                           151

     The Rottweiler's chewing on a shoe. Tearing it apart.

     EXT. BACKYARD. ROONEY

     He's standing outside the fence. He's missing a shoe. His
     suit pants are torn from the crotch to the knee. His suit
     coat pocket is torn off. His hair's messed and there're
     grass-stains on his knees and elbows. He's looking in at the
     dog.

                              ROONEY
               That's a $28.00 dress shoe, you
               worthless mutt!

     HIS POV

     The Rottweiler leaps at CAMERA.

152  EXT. CITY STREET                                            152

     Ferris is leading the way down Michigan Avenue. He's
     hustling through the crowd. He has Sloane by the hand. She's
     jogging to keep up. Cameron's a few steps behind. He keeps
     bumping into people. Ferris and Sloane make the turn at
     Wacker Driver and disappear into the Stone Container
     Building. Cameron follows, mumbling again.

                              CAMERON
               Money...tits...please...

153  EXT. HOUSE. FRONT                                           153

     A florist truck pulls up in front of the house. A DELIVERY
     MAN gets out iwth a huge floral arrangement. He heads up to
     the house.

154  EXT. HOUSE. PORCH                                           154

     Rooney's sitting on the porch patting a bloody knee with his
     handkerchief. The delivery man hops up on the steps. Rooney
     looks up at him. He greets Rooney cheerily.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               Howdy!

     He presses the doorbell. A beat and we hear Ferris'
     recording.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Who is it?

     The Deliver Man presses the intercom.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               Focus on Flowers. I have a delivery.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'm sorry but I can't come to the
               door right now. I'm very ill and I'm
               afraid...

               ROONEY                              FERRIS' VOICE
     It's a recording, asshole.        ...that in my weakened

               ROONEY                        (pause)
     He's one of my students.          You can reach my parents

                                       this illness has passed.

                          DELIVERY MAN
               As I heard it from our mailman
               he was supposedly born with only
               half a kidney.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Have a nice day.

                              DELIVERY MAN
                          (to the intercom)
               Thank you.
                          (continues)
               I don't know the details. But my
               boss had to send to Milwaukee to
               get more orchids. He's very
               popular.

     Rooney is flabbergasted.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               Nobody's home here?

                              ROONEY
               No.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               You gonna be around for awhile?

                              ROONEY
               I imagine so.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               You wanna keep an eye on these?

     Rooney looks at the flowers. Then he looks at the Delivery
     Man.

                              DELIVERY MAN
                          (happy sigh)
               It really touches me that so many people
               are rallying behind this guy. I guess
               there's hope for the human race afterall.

     He hands the arrangement to Rooney.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               Gotta run.

     He bounds off the porch and trots to the truck. Rooney looks
     incredulously at the arrangement. He opens the attached
     card.

                              ROONEY
                          (defeated)
               Oh, Christ...

     CU. CARD

     It's signed:

     behind his microphone.

                              D.J.
               I don't know who that was or
               what they were playing but I
               apologize for it nonetheless.

157  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE                                          157

     Jeanie's car pull in the driveway. We hear her car radio.

                              D.J.
               His name is Ferris Mueller.

                              FERRIS
               Bueller. Ferris Bueller.

     INT. CAR. JEANIE

     She goes into shock. Her eyes blink, her head cocks.

                              D.J.
               Sorry about that.

                              FERRIS
               It's cool.

     Jeanie draws back and punches out her radio.

     CU. CAR ANTENNA

     The impact of her blow to the radio shoots the antenna in
     the air.

158  INT. STUDIO                                                 158

     Ferris leans forward and adjusts the microphone.

                              D.J.
               He has an incredible story.

     Ferris turns to CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
               I'm going to tell a massive lie here.
               It's going to by very thick and very
               steamy. I think radio's a facinating
               medium, it challenges the imagination.
               Unlike television which provides the
               images, radio...
                          (pause)
               You know this. Anyway, it's always been
               a dream of mine to be on the radio.
               I have what I consider to be an excellent
               broadcast voice. I practise it in the
               bathroom all the time. I used to play
               records and do introductions to them.
               But I've never had the chance to sit
               behind a microphone and try it out
               for real. This is a 50,000 watt outlet.
               I'm going out to several million people
               so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant
               groove right now.
                          (clears his voice,

               Well, Steve, you and your listeners are

               I was going to say I knew Springsteen's

               to give out the number of the New
               Jersey State Police but I thought I

               box, which was not in any way, shape
               or from my fault. I was putting out a
               cigarette, like I was told. It was weird.
               I'm so used to getting in a car and
               lighting up, because I'm not allowed to
               smoke at home, that I got in the driver's
               ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out
               of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller
               looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny
               out of my nose or something and I realized
               what the hell I was doing and I went to
               put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway,
               I was so pissed off at her reaction to
               the whole thing that I considered running
               an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school
               teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna
               use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost
               too much. I took it again and passed. But
               I had to work at Burger King to get the
               cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The
               car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and
               I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I
               can't prove it? I'm in high school, remember?

     He turns back to the DJ.

                              D.J.
               How did you get picked for this.

                              FERRIS
               It's kind of a long story but I've
               been doing alot of programming for
               NASA.

161  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                        161

     A even larger group of kids is listening to the blaster.
     They're cheering him on.

162  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE. BACKYARD                                162

     The Rottweiler is laying unconscious on the lawn. The flower
     arrangement is scattered all over the yard and the ceramic
     vase the flowers were in has obviously struck the dog. The
     broken pieces are all around the dog's head.

     EXT. FERRIS HOUSE. BACKYARD. ROONEY

     He's smiling with great satisfaction.

                              ROONEY
               Sleep tight, pooch.

     He hears something in the house. His head snaps around. He
     drops down and peek in the windows.

     HIS POV

     A glimpse of a fleeting figure.

     CU. ROONEY

     His eyes dance in anticipation of revenge.

163  INT. HOUSE. FERRIS' ROOM                                    163

     Jeanie kicks the door open. The yardstick flings the covers
     and the pillows beneath them in the air. She stomps in and
     turns off the snoring synthesizer.

                              JEANIE
               I knew it!

     She grabs the phone and sits down. She dials a number.

164  EXT. HOUSE. FRONT                                           164

     Rooney sneaks around the side of the house. He slinks up on
     the porch. The front door's open. He peeks in.

165  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                           165

     Jeanie's on the phone.

                              JEANIE
               Is Mrs. Bueller there? Where is she?
               This is her daughter. Do you know where
               she is? Do you know when she'll be back?
               Do you know anything?

     She slams the phone down.

                              JEANIE
               The worm has luck like clams
               have body odor...

     She's startled by a noise downstairs. A smile spreads across
     her face. He's back and she's going to nail him.

166  INT. HOUSE. FOYER                                           166

     Rooney sneaks into the house. He looks around the foyer and
     heads into the kitchen.

167  INT. HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY                                167

     Jeanie tiptoes down the stairs.

168  INT. HOUSE. KITCHEN                                         168

     Rooney sneaks through the kitchen into the den.

169  INT. HOUSE. FOYER                                           169

     Jeanie comes down the stairs into the foyer.

170  INT. HOUSE. KITCHEN                                         170

     Rooney comes out of the den, back into the kitchen. He
     crosses back toward the foyer.

171  INT. FOYER                                                  171

172  INT. KITCHEN                                                172

     Jeanie and Rooney come face-to-face. Jeanie squeals in
     horror. She doesn't recognize Rooney as himself but as an
     intruder. She drops into a karate stance and kicks Rooney in
     the face. He hits the deck. She flees back up the stairs.

173  INT. CAR                                                    173

     Boyd is sitting in the backseat of Joyce's car listening to
     the radio.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               My input on the Star Wars defense
               plan was pretty substantial so I
               guess this is their way of rewarding
               me. I'm pretty flattered.

     EXT. CAR

     Joyce and her clients leave a show house and head toward the
     car.

     INT. CAR

     Boyd looks out the window as his parents and Joyce appear.

                              D.J. VOICE
               Can you stay around and take a few
               phone calls?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'd really like to but I have a kidney
               operation in about an hour.

     EXT. CAR

     Joyce and her clients take one last look at the house.

                              JOYCE
               If you're willing to commit a
               little time and a little money
               to this place, you can really
               have something to be proud of.
               Don't let the black living room
               throw you off.

     She opens the car door.

     INT. CAR

     The door opens.

                              D.J. VOICE
               I wish you the best of luck.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Thanks, Steve.

                              D.J. VOICE
               A very interesting guy, Ferris Bueller.

     Joyce gets in. The clients get in the other side. A song
     starts.

                              JOYCE
                          (to the kid)
               Well, Boyd, how are you bearing
               up?

     The kid stares at her.

                              JOYCE
               Did I tell you I have a son
               your age?

                              BOYD
               Twice.

                              JOYCE
               His name is Ferris. I think you'd
               like him.

     Boyd sits up in the seat at the mention of Ferris' name.

                              BOYD
               Is he going up in the space shuttle
               in September?

     Joyce looks around at Boyd. She gives him a curious look.

                              JOYCE
               Not that I know of.

                              BOYD
               I knew he was bullshitting.

                              MOTHER
               Watch your mouth.

                              BOYD
               How do you watch your mouth?

                              JOYCE
               Do you know my son?

                              FATHER
               Don't pay any attention to him.
               He thinks it's cute to bait adults.

                              BOYD
               I don't think it's cute. I think
               it's fun.

     Joyce give him a puzzled smile and starts the car.

174  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                           174

     Jeanie's on the phone. She's in a panic.

                              JEANIE
               This is not a phoeny phone call. There's
               an intruder, male caucasian, possibly armed,
               certainly weird, in our kitchen.
                          (pause)
               My name is Bueller.

     There's another pause. Jeanie's face drops.

                              JEANIE
               It's real nice that you hope my
               brother's feeling better but I'm
               in danger, okay? I'm very cute,
               I'm very alone and I'm very
               protective of my body. I'd rather
               not have it violated or killed.
               I need help!

175  INT. KITCHEN                                                175

     Rooney's plugging his bloody nose with paper towel. The
     intercom goes on.

                              JEANIE'S VOICE
               Excuse me. If whoever's in the house
               is still in the house, I'd like you
               to know that I have just called the police.
               If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll
               get your ass out of my house real quick.

     Rooney stiffens with fear.

                              JEANIE'S VOICE
               I'd also like to add that I have
               my father's gun. And a scorching
               case of herpes.

176  EXT. STREET                                                 176

     Rooney's car is hooked to a tow truck. It's parked in front
     of a fire hydrant and the windshield is decorated with
     parking citations. In the distance SIRENS WAIL.

177  EXT. PARKING LOT                                            177

     The three are waiting for the Ferrari. We HEAR TIRES
     SQUEALING, AN ENGINE REVING-OUT. Then the Ferrari pulls down
     the ramp and jams to a frightening stop. A BLACK GUY jumps
     out. Ferris hands him the parking stub.

                              FERRIS
               Just out of curiosity, what was
               your top speed coming down the
               ramp?

                              BLACK GUY
                          (matter-of-fact)
               About 60.

                              FERRIS
               Stunning!

     He hands him a buck and opens the door and pulls the
     passenger seat forward for Cameron.

                              FERRIS
               This is probably the last time you'll
               have to ride back here. Keep that in
               mind.

     Cameron gives him a look and squeezes in.

178  EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET                                        178

     The Ferrari cruises through traffic.

     INT. FERRARI

     Sloane's in the passenger seat. Ferris is driving and
     Cameron is crammed in the back.

                              SLOANE
               What's next.

                              CAMERON
               Nothing. We return the car.

                              SLOANE
               We could go to my house. My parents
               aren't coming home until late.

                              FERRIS
               We have enough cash left for a quick
               flight to Peoria and back.

                              CAMERON
               Very funny.

     Ferris looks in the mirror and changes lanes. He glances
     down at the speedometer, then to the road. And back to the
     speedometer.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron? How many miles did you
               say this thing had when we left?

                              CAMERON
               One hundred and twenty six and
               halfway between three and four
               tenths. Why? How many miles are
               on it now?

     He glances down at the speedometer.

     CU. SPEEDOMETER

     The odometer reads 432.7.

                              FERRIS

               Here's where Cameron goes berserk.

     EXT. TRAFFIC

     The Ferrari pulls up at a stop light. We HEAR A THUNDERING,
     MUFFLED SCREAM.

     EXT. EXPRESSWAY

     The Ferrari is buzzing through traffic.

     INT. FERRARI

     Sloane turns in her seat and looks at Cameron. Her gesture
     is one of genuine support.

                              SLOANE
               You okay?

     CU. CAMERON

     His eyes are frozen in a mindless, vacant stare.

     CU. FERRIS

     He looks at Sloane. He's concerned.

                              FERRIS
               Hey, Cameron. It's okay. We'll fix
               it.

     CU. CAMERON

     He's still holding the stare. He starts to breathe heavily.
     He's trembling.

     CU. SLOANE

     She whips around in the seat and grabs his arms.

                              SLOANE
               Cameron! Cut it out! What's
               wrong?! Ferris!

     CU. FERRIS

     He shoots Sloane a look.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, are you okay? It's
               no problem, really. Your old
               man won't know a thing. It's
               completely fixable.

     INT. FERRARI

     Sloane fires an angry look at Ferris.

                              SLOANE
               Shut-up! It is a problem! For
               him it's a problem. Nothing's
               a problem for you. But it's
               a problem for him! So, just
               shut-up.

     She turns back to Cameron.

                              SLOANE
               What can I do, Cameron?

     CU. FERRIS

     Eyes front. He knows what he's doing.

     The doorbell rings. The Ferris' tape is activated.

                              FERRIS VOICE
               Who is it?

     We hear a MALE VOICE over the intercom.

                              VOICE
               Anybody home?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'm sorry that I can't come to
               the door right now...

     The tape continues as Jeanie hurtles down the stairs.

                              JEANIE
               I'm saved! Thank you, God!
               Thank you, thank you, thank you!

     She jumps the last few stairs and slides to the front door.
     She whips it open.

180  EXT. HOUSE. FRONT DOOR                                      180

     The door swings open.

               Thank...you...

     Her jaw goes slack. She blinks her eyes.

     HER POV

     The Delivery Man and a young ASSISTANT are standing at the
     door with floral arrangements. Spread all around them are
     more flowers. A sexy singing NURSE and a BALLOON MAN steps
     up on the porch.

     The door slams shut.

181  EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET                                    181

     Rooney's walking down the street. A school bus is crawling
     alongside him as kids hang out the windows. From inside we
     hear SHOUTING and seventeen different SONGS PLAYING ON
     BLASTERS. A top forty montage.

                              KID
               Hey, Mr. Rooney! What're you doing?

     Rooney doesn't respond.

                              ANOTHER KID
               Did you get in a fight?

     Rooney keep walking. The bus doors open. The DRIVER calls
     out to him.

                              DRIVER
               You want a lift?

     Rooney takes a few more steps. He stops. The bus stops.
     Rooney takes a deep breath. He climbs aboard the bus.

182  INT. BUS                                                    182

     The bus is jammed with WONKS and WEINERETTES. The passengers
     are silent as they watch Rooney shuffle down the aisle and
     take an empty seat next to a skinny, myopic GIRL.

     CU. GIRL

     She looks at Rooney and smiles. She pushes her Coke bottle
     glasses up on her nose.

     CU. ROONEY

     He looks vacantly at her.

     CU. GIRL

     She holds her smile.

                              GIRL
               I'll bet you never smelled a
               real school bus before.

     CU. ROONEY

     He stares at her.

     CU. GIRL

     She holds up a candy package.

                              GIRL
               Gummi Bear?

     CU. ROONEY

     He stares at her.

     CU. GIRL

     She puts one in her mouth.

                              GIRL
               They've been in pocket. They're
               real soft and warm.

     CU. BOY

     A rotund FRESHMAN BOY sitting across from Rooney is staring
     at him.

     CU. ROONEY

     He looks across to the kid.

     CU. BOY

     He leans forward.

                              FRESHMAN BOY
               It's kind of like being in the
               belly of the beast isn't it?

     CU. ROONEY

     He turns him eyes to the front. The bus jerks forward and
     pulls away.

183  EXT. BUS                                                    183

     It grinds through the gears as it heads down the quiet
     street. The BLASTERS go back on, the SHOUTING RESUMES.

184  EXT. PARK                                                   184

     Cameron's laying on a picnic table. Sloane's sitting beside
     him on the table. She's stroking his hair. Ferris WALKS INTO
     THE FOREGROUND. He addresses CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
               This may very well be for real. I
               think Cameron might have blown a
               micro-chip or two. He's always been
               a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do
               was give him a good day. We're
               gonna graduate in a couple of months.
               Then we have the summer. He'll work
               and I'll work. And we'll see each
               other at night and on the weekends
               but then he'll go to one school and I'll
               go to another. And basically that'll
               be it. As much as we like each other,
               the process of growing up will
               separate us.

     He begins to walk. We follow him.

                              FERRIS
               Sloane's a bigger problem. She still
               has another year of high school. How
               do I deal with that? I was serious when
               I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't
               just teenage infatuation. That's what my
               parents call it. What do they call what they
               have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation.

     CU. CAMERON

     His eyes are closed. Sloane's stroking his hair.

                              FERRIS (VO)
               Cameron's never been in love. At
               least no one's ever been in love
               with him. He's gonna marry the first
               girl he lays. And she's gonna treat
               him like shit because he's gonna
               kiss her ass for giving him what he's
               built-up in his mind as the end-all,
               be-all of human existance. She won't
               respect him because you can't respect
               someone who kisses your ass. It just
               doesn't work.

     CU. SLOANE

     She's studying Cameron's face. She looks away.

                              SLOANE
               Ferris?

     CU. FERRIS

     He looks to the picnic table. Then back to CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
               I'm being tested here.

     He starts back to the picnic table.

                              FERRIS
               My best friend has flipped-out.
               Conventional wisdom would suggest
               a visit to the nearest trauma
               center. I wouldn't fault anybody
               for doing that. My, personally,
               I think this calls for something
               new, something bold, something wet
               and wild.

185  CU. JACUZZI JET                                             185

     UNDERWATER SHOT. A hyrdojet spews a gush of air bubbles.

     CU. BLASTER

     A finger pushes the PLAY button on the cassette. MUSIC COMES
     UP.

     CU. BEER CAN LID

     The finger pops a beer.

     CU. OREO PACKAGE

     A painted fingernail pierces the cellophane wrapper.

     INT. JACUZZI

     Ferris and Sloane are in Sloane's parents' Jacuzzi. Their
     clothes are tosssed around the deck. Cameron's been placed
     in a patio chair at the edge of the Jacuzzi. He's still
     catatonic. He's mummbling softly. Ferris is drinking a beer.
     Sloane's eating Oreos.

                              FERRIS
               You feeling any better, Cameron?

                              SLOANE
               The water's really nice. I wish
               you'd come in.

     CU. CAMERON

     Staring into space.

                              CAMERON
               Surgery...fire...move...

     CU. SLOANE AND FERRIS

     They look at each other. She offers him a cookie. He offers
     her his beer.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron? Do you think this because
               of the car or is it a combination
               of everything shitty in your life?

     CU. CAMERON

     He doesn't respond.

                              CAMERON
               Music...kiss...attack...

     CU. SLOANE AND FERRIS

     Sloane sips the beer.

                              FERRIS
               You just can't deal with anymore
               shit? The car took you into the
               red zone? Time for a reality check?

                              SLOANE
               Cameron? I could flip real easy, too.
               There's nothing wrong with it. At one
               time or another, everybody goes to
               the zoo.

                              FERRIS
               Maybe he was actually sick. Maybe
               he wasn't bullshitting himself.

     CU. CAMERON

     No response.

                              CAMERON
               Gesundheit...God...mercy...

     EXT. BACKYARD

     Ferris and Sloane watch their catatonic friend.

     CU. CAMERON

     He smiles.

     CU. SLOANE

     She leans forward and stares at Cameron.

     CU. FERRIS

     He cocks his head, wondering what Cameron's up to.

     CU. CAMERON

     He keels over forward.

     EXT. BACKYARD

     Cameron falls out of the chair and splashes down,
     face-first, into the water. Sloane screams. Ferris leaps for
     him.

     UNDERWATER

     Ferris struggles with Cameron's lifeless bulk.

     CU. SLOANE

     She's screaming. Ferris thrashes around in the water.

     UNDERWATER

     Ferris grabs Cameron's collar and rips him out of the water.

     EXT. BACKYARD

     Ferris sits Cameron on the edge of the Jacuzzi.

                              FERRIS
               CAMERON!

     CU. CAMERON

     His eyes are closed. He's lifeless.

     CU. FERRIS

     His face is a mask of terror. He shakes Cameron.

     CU. SLOANE

     She's screaming.

     CU. CAMERON

     A smile spreads across his face.

     CU. FERRIS

     He sees the smile. He stops shaking Cameron.

     EXT. JACUZZI

     Ferris and Cameron are looking at each other. Sloane's still
     screaming. She realizes that Cameron's okay. She stops
     screaming.

                              SLOANE
               What?

                              FERRIS
                          (Cameron)
               You asshole!

     Cameron's smiling.

                              SLOANE
               What?

     Ferris starts to laugh. Cameron explodes with laughter.
     Sloane's bewildered.

                              SLOANE
               What's so funny?

186  INT. POLICE STATION. WAITING ROOM                           186

     Jeanie's sitting on a wooden bench with a WASTED TEENAGE BOY
     in a Triumph t-shirt, long hair, torn jeans, creepers, studs
     and chains. He's studying her.

                              BOY
               Drugs?

                              JEANIE
               No, thank you. I'm straight.

                              BOY
               I meant, are you here for drugs?

     Jeanie stares at him.

                              JEANIE
               Why are you here?

                              BOY
               Drugs.

                              JEANIE
               I don't know why I'm here.

                              BOY
               Then why don't you go home?

                              JEANIE
               Why don't you put your thumb
               up your butt?

     The boy stares at her.

                              BOY
               You want to talk about your problem?

                              JEANIE
               With you? Are you serious?

                              BOY
               Yeah, I'm serious.

                              JEANIE
               Blow yourself.

     Jeanie turns away. The boy crosses his legs. Jeanie looks
     back at him.

                              JEANIE
               You really want to know what's wrong?

     The boy shrugs.

                              JEANIE
               Alright. If you've got the time,
               I've got the troubles. In a nutshell,
               I hate my brother. How's that?

                              BOY
               That's cool. Did you shoot him or
               something?

                              JEANIE
               No, not yet.

     The boy nods. He understands the emotion.

                              JEANIE
               I went home to confirm that the
               shithead was ditching school and
               a guy broke into the house and I
               called the cops and they picked me
               up for making a phoney phone call.

                              BOY
               What do you care if your brother
               ditches school?

     Jeanie stares at the boy.

                              JEANIE
               Why should he get to ditch school
               when everybody else has to go?

                              BOY
               You could ditch.

                              JEANIE
               I'd get caught.

                              BOY
               So, you're pissed at him because
               he ditches and doesn't get caught?

                              JEANIE
               Basically.

     The boy nods knowingly.

                              BOY
               Then your problem is you.

                              JEANIE
               Excuse me?

                              BOY
               Excuse you. You oughta spend a little
               more time dealing with yourself and
               a little less time worrying about
               what your brother does. It's just
               an opinion.

     Jeanie stares angrily at him. Partly because he's so bold
     and partly because he's so right.

                              BOY
               There's somebody you should talk
               to.

     Jeanie stares at him threateningly.

                              JEANIE
               If you say Ferris Bueller, you lose
               a testicle.

                              BOY
               You know him?

     It's spinning rapidly.

     CY. ACCELERATOR

     A brick's resting on the accelerator, holding it down.

     INT. CAMERON'S GARAGE

     Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are sitting in the garage. The
     Ferrari is jacked up. The wheels are turning. The engine's
     racing.

                              CAMERON
               The whole time I was just thinking
               things over. I was like, meditating.
               I was thinking about the future.
               And I realized it doesn't make
               and difference if the present
               goes to shit.

                              FERRIS
               I have a agree with you there.

                              SLOANE
               Really.

                              CAMERON
               I've been thinking all day that if
               you could only have the use of one
               word, what would it be?

                              FERRIS
               Sloane is naked before your eyes and
               you're thinking about words?

                              SLOANE
               God bless you, Cameron.

                              CAMERON
               Thank you, Sloane.

                              CAMERON
               If you guys only had one word, what
               would it be?

                              FERRIS
               I can't believe you'd think up something
               like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi
               right in front of you.

                              SLOANE
               Come on, Ferris, answer his question.

                              FERRIS
               Bathroom.

                              SLOANE
               I'd say...

     She thinks.

                              FERRIS
               Cash.

                              CAMERON
               It's the only word you could
               ever use.

                              FERRIS
               Hello.

                              SLOANE
               Love.

                              FERRIS
               And what is you loathe somebody?
               Are you going to say "love" every
               time you see them?

                              SLOANE
               It's better than "hello".

                              FERRIS
               Hellos' generic.

                              SLOANE
               You wanna be generic?

                              CAMERON
               It's help.

     Cameron smiles at his wisdom. Ferris and Sloane think about
     it. It's a good choice. Cameron gets up and walks to the
     Ferrari.

                              CAMERON
               The word is help.

     Cameron peeks in the window.

     CU. ODOMETER

     Nothing's happening.

     INT. GARAGE

     Cameron pulls his head out of the car.

                              CAMERON
               Ferris? It's not working.

     Ferris looks up.

                              CAMERON
               The miles aren't coming off, running
               it in reverse.

                              FERRIS
               I thought that might be a problem.
               Let's crack open the odometer and
               roll it back by hand.

     Cameron shakes his head.

                              CAMERON
               I got a better idea. It's cool.

     He walks back around behind the Ferrari.

                              CAMERON
               Seventeen years and I've never
               taken a stand. Now, I'm gonna
               do it. I'm taking a stand against
               my father, against my family,
               against myself, against my past,
               my present and my future. I will
               not sit idly by as events that affect
               me unfold to change the course of
               my life. I will take a stand and I
               will defend it. When my father comes
               home tonight, he's finally going
               to have to deal with me. Good or
               bad, I'm taking a stand.

     CU. FERRIS

     He turns to CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
               This is a big U-2 fan.

     CU. SLOANE

     She smiles proudly at Cameron. She applauds him.

     CU. CAMERON

     He's serious and determined. He has made up his mind and it
     appears that it won't be changed by anyone but himself.

     CU. TIRES

     It's spinning wildly.

     CU. MERCEDES BUMPER

     Cameron's foot rests on the bumper. A beat and it gives a
     mighty shove.

     CU. TIRE

     The spinning tires slam down on the cement.

     INT. GARAGE

     Cameron has kicked the Ferrari off the jack. It squeals out
     of the garage in a cloud of blue tire smoke. A $50,000
     unmanned investment heading backwards down a driveway.

     CU. SLOANE AND FERRIS

     They're in shock.

     EXT. HOUSE

     The Ferrari shoots down the driveway.

     INT. GARAGE

     Cameron watches the car go. He's strangely placcid about the
     impending disaster. Ferris and Sloane are bewildered.

     THEIR POV

     The Ferrari travels down the driveway, across the street,
     over the curb into the wooded property opposite the house.

     CU. TREE

     The Ferrari's brief journey ends as it smacks a tree trunk.

     INT. GARAGE

     Ferris and Sloane exchange baffled looks. They look at
     Cameron. He's proud and bold.

                              FERRIS
               What was that about?

                              SLOANE
               This has to be a dream.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron? One quick question.
               Why'd you do that?

     Cameron holds his proud posture for a beat. Then a look of
     bewilderment comes over his face. He shoots a look to
     Ferris. A puzzled look.

                              FERRIS
               You trashed the car.

     Cameron looks across the street.

                              SLOANE
               Why?

                              CAMERON
               I took a stand.

                              FERRIS
               No, Cameron. You wrecked a car.

     Cameron thinks for a moment. Then he regains his confidence.

                              CAMERON
               It's okay.

     Ferris looks across the street at the car.

                              FERRIS
               I have an idea. If you're interested.

     Cameron looks at him. He shakes his head.

                              CAMERON
               I'm gonna handle it.

                              FERRIS
               I think this could work.

                              CAMERON
               No, thanks. I want to deal with
               it by myself.

                              SLOANE
               What about your one word?

                              CAMERON
               You already did it. If I need it
               again, I'll use it.

     He smiles. He raises am impish eyebrow.

                              CAMERON
               It's cool. I'm loose.

188  INT. POLICE STATION. OFFICE                                 188

     Joyce is talking with the juvenile officer. Outside the
     office, on the bench, we see Jeanie and the boy making out.

                              JOYCE
               She's never been in trouble before.
               This is a shock to me. First, I
               don't know why she wasn't at school.
               Second, I don't know why she'd call
               you with this story about a rapist.

                              OFFICER
               For whatever reasons she did it,
               I think she'd had a good scare.

                              JOYCE
               I hope so. I appreciate your calling
               me. I can assure you that her father
               and I will have a long talk with her.

     The gathers her purse and jacket and stands.

                              JOYCE
               Thank you.

                              OFFICER
               Oh, by the way, I hope you son's
               feeling better.

     Joyce looks at the officer curiously.

                              OFFICER
               Tell him, all the guys at the
               station here are pulling for
               him.

189  INT. POLICE STATION. WAITING ROOM                           189

     Jeanie quickly breaks the embrace with the boy as Joyce
     steps out of the juvenile officer's room. She's still a
     little bewildered that everybody knows Ferris was ill.
     Jeanie wipes her lips and sits up straight. The boy adjusts
     his pants to better hide his passion.

                              JEANIE
                          (to the boy)
               If you keep this to yourself, I
               think we can probably get it on
               pretty good.

                              BOY
               For sure.

     Jeanie stands up.

                              JEANIE
               Hi.

                              JOYCE
               Don't "hi" me, young lady. Get
               your stuff.

     Jeanie reaches down for her purse.

                              BOY
               What's your name?

                              JEANIE
               Jean. What's yours?

                              BOY
               Garth Volbeck.

190  EXT. SLOANE'S BACKYARD                                      190

     Sloane and Ferris are standing at the back fence.

                              SLOANE
               I had a great time today.

                              FERRIS
               Yeah. It was pretty cool.

                              SLOANE
               You think Cameron's gonna be
               alright?

                              FERRIS
               Sure. He had to so it, I guess.
               His old man had it coming. He'll
               be okay. I'd be worried if he'd
               taken my idea.

     Sloane smiles knowingly.

                              SLOANE
               You didn't have an idea, did you?

                              FERRIS
               Not a glimmer.

                              SLOANE
               You're so smart.

                              FERRIS
               No. I'm just real loose.

     He kisses her.

                              FERRIS
               I'll call you tonight.

     Sloane nods. Ferris jumps the fence and takes off across the
     backyards. Sloane watches him go. A huge smile spreads
     across her face.

                              SLOANE
               I LOVE YOU!

     She backs away from the fence. MUSIC FADES UP.

                              SLOANE
               He's gonna marry me. I know it.

     She turns and runs into the house.

191  EXT. BACKYARD                                               191

     Ferris sprints across a backyard. He jumps a plaster elf.

192  EXT. ANOTHER BACKYARD                                       192

     Ferris vaults a fence. He runs directly for a swimming pool.
     He's approaching it from the side. He leaps, hits the diving
     board, springs off, does a flip and lands on the grass on
     the other side of the pool.

193  CU. BEDSPREAD                                               193

     Neatly bundles stacks of bills and rolled coins. A
     significant amount of cash.

     CU. SLOANE

     She's writing.

     CU. PIECE OF PAPER

     We see a portion of the typewritten letter as she signs it.

               "...in the amount of $1,765.33. It
               gives us great pleasure to assist
               you in performance of your worthy
               and much needed survives to those
               so desperately in need.

                              Sincerely,

                              Sloane Peterson
                              Executive Director
                              The Ferris Bueller Foundation"

194  EXT. FERRIS' STREET                                         194

     He's running down the middle of the street. A car honks.
     Ferris moves to the side. The car pulls around him.

     INT. CAR.

     Tom's at the wheel. He glances in the mirror. He does a
     take.

     HIS POV. MIRROR

     We see Ferris cut across a front lawn and into a house.

     CU. TOM

     He realizes it couldn't be Ferris.

195  INT. HOUSE                                                  195

     Ferris runs through the kitchen, past a WOMAN, fixing dinner
     and out her backdoor. The Woman looks up curiously.

196  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE                                          196

     Tom pulls in the driveway. He parks and gets out. Joyce
     pulls in from the other direction.

197  EXT. HOUSE. BACK PORCH                                      197

     Ferris tries the door. It's locked. He reaches down and
     lifts the doormat.

     CU. PORCH

     The outline of a key in the dirt under the mat. The key's
     gone. The toe of a chewed-up dress shoe steps INTO FRAME. An
     OMNIOUS CHORD IS STRUCK.

     CU. FERRIS

     He stares up in horror.

     HIS POV

     Rooney's looking down at him. He's holding the house key.

     EXT. PORCH

     Ferris stands up. He smiles.

                              ROONEY
               Looking for this?

                              FERRIS
               Yes.

                              ROONEY
               I got you, Ferris. This time I finally
               got you.

     Ferris is caught. There's no way out. Rooney gloats
     severely.

                              ROONEY
               How does another year of high
               school sit with you?

     Suddenly, the backdoor opens. Jeanie looks out. She feigns
     joy and relief. She rushes Ferris and hugs him.

                              JEANIE
               Thank God, you're alright! We've
               been worried sick!

     CU. FERRIS

     A moment of curiosity. Then it dawns on him what's
     happening. He smiles.

     CU. ROONEY

     His eyes dart from Ferris to Jeanie to Ferris. His victory
     is evaporating.

     EXT. PORCH

     Jeanie breaks the embrace.

                              JEANIE
                          (to Rooney)
               Thank you for bringing him home,
               Mr. Rooney.
                          (to Ferris)
               You better get up in bed tight
               now.

     Ferris limps into the house.

                              JEANIE
               Can you imagine someone as sick as
               Ferris trying to walk home from the
               hospital?
                          (shakes her head)
               Kids!

     CU. ROONEY

     He's dumbfounded.

     CU. JEANIE

     She raises her hands and strikes a karate pose. A huge smile
     passes over her face.

     CU. ROONEY

     A look of terror as he realizes that is was Jeanie who
     kicked him and that Jeanie knows it was he who she kicked.

     EXT. PORCH

     Jeanie steps into the house.

198  INT. HOUSE                                                  198

     The door closes on Rooney's defeated, lost, dejected,
     bewildered face. Not only has he lost Ferris again, he has
     Jeanie to deal with next year.

199  EXT. YARD. CU. DOG                                          199

     The click of the door wakes him up. His head pops up off the
     grass.

     CU. ROONEY

     He senses new danger. We hear AN O.C. GROWL. Rooney squeezes
     his eyes shut.

200  INT. KITCHEN                                                200

     Kimberly and Todd are sitting at the kitchen table watching
     TV and eating cereal. They look up at Ferris as he comes in
     from outside.

                              TODD
               Ferris?  Does my head look like
               it's getting bigger?

     Ferris leans against the counter as he tries to catch his
     breath. He looks at his little brother.

                              FERRIS
               No, but Kimberly's is.

     He crosses to the refrigerator and opens it. Kimberly feels
     her head.

                              KIMBERLY
                          (to Todd)
               Is he serious?

                              TODD
               I think so.

                              KIMBERLY
               Oh, shit!

     Ferris takes out a bottle of orange juice out of the
     refrigerator and drinks straight from the bottle. Jeanie
     comes in.

                              FERRIS
               Thanks, Jeanie.

                              JEANIE
               No problem.

                              FERRIS
               By the way, I borrowed some cash
               from you. I'll pay you back.

                              JEANIE
               You don't have to.

                              FERRIS
               I want to.

                              JEANIE
               You don't have to. I've been ripping
               off your wallet for years.

     Ferris gives her a proud smile.

201  EXT. HOUSE                                                  201

     Joyce and Tom head up to the kitchen.

202  INT. KITCHEN                                                202

     Ferris and Jeanie exit the kitchen as Joyce and Tom enter.

                              JOYCE
                          (to Todd and Kimberly)
               Hi, guys.

                              KIMBERLY
               Is my head swelling up?

203  INT. HOUSE. FOYER                                           203

     The foyer is jammed with floral arrangements, plants and
     gifts. Ferris and Jeanie step gingerly through the flowers
     and head upstairs.

                              JEANIE
               I'm sorry I've been riding your
               buns for so long.

                              FERRIS
               It's completely cool.

                              JOYCE (OC)
               Ferris!

     Ferris continues up the stairs. He affects a sickly voice.

                              FERRIS
               Upstairs, Mom!

204  INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING                                   204

     Ferris and Jeanie stop.

                              JEANIE
               Do you know a guy named Garth
               Volbeck?

                              FERRIS
               Vaguely.

                              JEANIE
               Is he cool?

                              FERRIS
               He's cool. But stay away from his
               brother.

     Ferris walks into the room, brushes the crumbs off his hands
     and peels off his shirt. He climbs into bed. No sooner are
     the covers over him than the bedroom door opens and Joyce
     and Tom walk in. They walk over to the bed. Joyce sits down.

                              JOYCE
               Honey?

     CU. FERRIS

     The same deathly face he had in the morning. Tongue out,
     eyes bulging.

                              TOM (OC)
               Ferris? How do you feel?

     He pulls in his tongue to speak.

                              FERRIS
                          (deathly gasp)
               150% better, thank you.

205  INT. BEDROOM                                                205

     Tom and Joyce hover over him with deep concern.

                              FERRIS
               I'm much better, really. Please,
               don't make me stay home again. I
               want to go to school. I'm graduating
               in June and I...

                              TOM
               Ferris. You're sick. There's no point
               pushing yourself and making it worse.

                              FERRIS
               Maybe you're right, Dad.

                              TOM
               I know I'm right.

     Joyce leans over and kisses him forehead.

                              JOYCE
               How did you get so sweet?

                              FERRIS
               Years of practice.

     Tom pats Ferris on the rump. He and Joyce exit.

     CU. FERRIS

     The hideous face. A beat and we HEAR THE BEDROOM DOOR CLOSE.
     Ferris looks at CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
                          (happy sigh)
               Yeah, life is a carousel. A
               great big crazy ball of pure
               living, breathing joy and delight.

     He rolls over on his back and puts his hands behind his
     head.

                              FERRIS
               You gotta get one.

     He smiles.

               Where's my wallet?!

                          (whispers, sadistic)
               When you turn ten, your head's going
               to swell up real big like a watermelon
               and we're going to have to put you
               to sleep like they do with a dog.

                              TODD

               WHO PISSED ON THE TOILET SEAT!? MOTHER!!

                              TOM
               Where's Mom?

                              TODD
               Is my head going to swell up?

                              TOM
               What?!

                              JEANIE
               OH, MY GOD! THE TOILET PAPER'S ALL WET!!!

                              MOTHER (JOYCE)
                          (screams)
               TOM!

     The house falls dead SILENT. We hear footsteps thundering
     through the house. A TENSE STRAIN OF MUSIC FADES UP.

                              TODD
               What's that?

                              KIMBERLY
               Wait! Hold still!

                              TODD
               What?!

                              KIMBERLY
               You heads starting to swell up!!

     Todd screams. We hear the sound of Tom's footsteps running
     through the kitchen, down the hall, up the stairs, up the
     hallway. A door open.

                              TOM
                          (breathless)
               What's the matter?

                              JOYCE
                          (worried)
               It's Ferris!

                              TOM
               What's wrong?

                              JOYCE
                          (snaps)
               What's wrong? For Christ's sake!
               Look at him!

  2  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              2

     An eighteen year-old boy. He's staring lifelessly at CAMERA.
     His mouth's open. His eyes are bugged-out. His tongue is fat
     and dry in his mouth. He's laying in bed, on his side.

  3  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                            3

     Ferris' parents, TOM and JOYCE BUELLER are standing at
     bedside. They're in their late forties, early fifties.
     Handsome, upper-middle class parents. They're both dressed
     for work.

                              TOM
               Ferris?

                              JOYCE
               He doesn't have a fever. But he says
               his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.

  4  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              4

     His lifeless eyes blink.

  5  INT. BEDROOM. PARENTS                                         5

     Tom bends down and touches Ferris' forehead.

                              TOM
               What's the matter, Ferris?

                              JOYCE
               Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy.

     Tom takes one of Ferris' hands.

                              TOM
                          (discreetly)
               Should you call the doctor?

                              JOYCE
                          (whispers)
               He doesn't want me to.

                              TOM
               Why don't you want Mom to call
               the doctor?

     Ferris exhales loudly. He tries to speak but all he can
     manage is a choked gasp.

                              TOM
               What?

     Ferris tries again.

                              FERRIS
                          (raspy)
               Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.

     He starts to get up. Joyce gently pushes him back down.

                              FERRIS
               I have a test today. I have to take it.
               I want to get into a good college
               so I can have a fruitful life...

                              JOYCE
               You're not going to school like
               this.
                          (to Tom)
               Maybe I should call the office and
               tell them I won't be in.

                              FERRIS
               I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!

     He's gripped by a seizure. His body stiffens and he chokes.
     His older sister, JEANIE, walks into the room. She's dressed
     for school. She's cute and stuck-up. A major pill.

                              JEAN
               Oh, fine. What's this? What's his problem?

                              JOYCE
               He doesn't feel well.

                              JEAN
               Yeah, right. Dry that one out
               and you can fertilize the lawn.

                              TOM
               That's enough, Jeanie.

                              JEANIE
               You're not falling for this, are you?
               Tell me you're not falling for this.

                              FERRIS
               Is that Jeanie? I can't see that
               far. Jeanie?

                              JEANIE
               Pucker up and squat, Ferris.

                              JOYCE
                          (annoyed)
               Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school.

                              JEANIE
                          (angry, defeated)
               You're really letting him stay home?
               I can't believe this. If I was bleeding
               out my eyes, you guys'd make me go to
               school. It's so unfair.

                              FERRIS
               Please don't be upset with me, Jeanie.
               Be thankful that you're fit and have
               your health. Cherish it.

                              JEANIE
                          (to herself)
               Oh, I wanna puke.

     She glares at Ferris. Her eyes are mascara and vengence. She
     slips out of the room. Ferris' brother, TODD and sister,
     KIMBERLY peek into the room.

                              KIMBERLY
               Myocardial infarction?

                              JOYCE
               Get your stuff. Daddy'll be right
               down.

                              KIMBERLY
               Syphilitic meningitus? That would be
               a huge family embarrassment.

                              TOM
               Get downstairs!

                              KIMBERLY
               If he dies, I got dibs on his stereo.

     She turns sharply and exits.

                              TODD
                          (worried)
               Dad? Does my head look alright?

                              JOYCE
               Get downstairs! Now!

                              TODD
               Just answer me one question! Is it
               swelling up? Kim said it was going
               to get as big as...

                              KIMBERLY (OC)
               A WATERMELON!

                              TODD
                          (yells out the room)
               Shut-up!

                              JOYCE
               Get downstairs! NOW!

     Todd backs out of the room.

                              FERRIS
               I'll be okay. I'll just sleep.
               Maybe I'll have an aspirin around
               noon.

                              JOYCE
                          (to Ferris)
               I'm showing houses to the family
               from California today but I'll be in
               the area. My office'll know where
               I am, if you need me.

                              TOM
               I'll check it with you, too.

                              FERRIS
               It's nice to know I have such
               loving, caring parents. You're
               both very special people.

  6  CU. FERRIS                                                    6

     He acknowledges Tom with a pathetic flutter of his eyelids.

  7  INT. BEDROOM. JOYCE                                           7

     She strokes Ferris' hair.

                              JOYCE
               I hope you feel better, pumpkin.

     She leans down and kisses his forehead. Tom pats his
     shoulder.

                              TOM
               Get some rest.

  8  CU. FERRIS                                                    8

     Ferris lets out a wheeze. His glassy eyes follow his parents
     to the door.

                              JOYCE (OC)
               We love you, sweetie.

                              TOM (OC)
               Call if you need us.

     They close the door. The lock clicks. Ferris' eyes shift
     from the door to CAMERA. A sly, little smile crawls across
     his lips.

                              FERRIS
               They bought it.

     The MTV theme music ROARS IN.

  9  CU. TV SCREEN                                                 9

     The TV at the foot of Ferris' bed. The MTV logo is playing.

 10  INT. BEDROOM                                                 10

     Ferris yanks open the drapes. The pall of the sickroom
     disappears in the brilliant glow of morning sunlight.

                              FERRIS
               Incredible! One of the worst performances
               of my career and they never doubted it
               for a second.
                          (looks out the window)
               What a beautiful day!

     He turns from the window.

                              FERRIS
               Parents always fall for the clammy hands.
               It's physical evidence of illness. It's
               a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are
               generally pretty hip to the fever scams.
               And to make them work you have to go a hundred
               and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous
               mother and you end up in a doctor's office
               and that's worse than school.

     He flips on his stereo and fills the room with the MTV
     broadcast. A NEW SONG begins.

                              FERRIS
               Fake a stomach cramp and when you're
               doubled over, moaning and wailing, just
               lick your palms. It's a little stupid
               and childish but then so if high school.
               Right?

     He equalizes the sound a little.

                              FERRIS
               This is my ninth sick day with semester.
               If I go for ten, I'm probably going to
               have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely
               must make this one count.

     He exits into the hallway.

 11  INT. BATHROOM                                                11

     Ferris walks into the bathroom. It's littered with Jean's
     debris. He turns on the shower water.

                              FERRIS
               I don't care if you're fifty five
               or seven, everybody needs a day off
               now and then. It's a beautiful day.
               How can I be expected to handle
               high school?

     He bends down OUT OF FRAME as he loses his briefs. He pops
     up.

                              FERRIS
               I do actually have a test. That wasn't
               bullshit.

     He steps into the shower. Through the pebbled glass of the
     shower door we see Ferris' outline.

                              FERRIS
               That I care about it was.

 12  INT. BATHROOM. SHOWER STALL.                                 12

     Inside the shower. Ferris' hair is standing straight up.
     It's moulded into a fin with shampoo.

                              FERRIS
               It's on European socialism. I mean,
               really. What's the point? I'm not
               European. I don't plan to be European.
               So, who gives a shit if they're socialists?
               They could be fascist anarchists and it
               still wouldn't change the fact that I
               don't own a car.

     He turns the shower head around and uses it like a
     microphone.

                              FERRIS
                          (sings)
               WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY,
               TWIST AND SHOUT...

 13  INT. HALLWAY. LATER                                          13

     Ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around
     his waist. He's drying his hair with another of a different
     color.

                              FERRIS
               Not that I condone fascism. Or
               and "isms". "Isms", in my opinion
               are not good. A person should not
               believe in an "ism". He should
               believe in himself. John Lennon
               said it on his first solo album.
               "I don't believe in Beatles, I
               just believe in me." A good point
               there. Afterall, he was the Walrus.

     He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it.

                              FERRIS
               I could be the Walrus and I'd still
               have to bum rides off people.

     He passes CAMERA and goes into his room.

                              FERRIS (OC)
               I'm not very political? Let me
               put that into perspective...

 14  INT. BEDROOM                                                 14

     Ferris tosses the towel he's dried hair with on the bed.

                              FERRIS
               My uncle went to Canada to protest
               the war, right? On the Fourth of
               July he was down with my aunt and he
               got drunk and told my Dad he felt
               guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam.
               So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle
               Jeff? In wartime you want to be a
               pacifist and in peacetime you want
               to be a soldier. It took you twenty
               years to find out you don't believe
               in anything?"
                          (snaps his fingers)
               Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks.
                          (pause)
               Be careful when you deal with old
               hippies. They can be real touchy.

     He opens his door.

 15  INT. CLOSET                                                  15

     The door opens and Ferris rifles through his shirts.

                              FERRIS
               My mother was a hippie. But she
               lost it. She got old. If she listens
               to the White Album now? She doesn't hear
               music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is
               her favorite drug. It'll probably be
               mine, too. I hope not.

     He finds a shirt he likes. He steps back from the closet and
     puts it on. He drops the towel.

 16  INT. BEDROOM                                                 16

     He walks across the room to his dresser. He opens his
     underwear drawer. There's an old model of a submarine on the
     top of the dresser. He picks it up.

                              FERRIS
               In eighth grade a friend of mine
               made a bong out of one of these.
               The smoke tasted like glue.

     He pulls out a pair of underwear. He gets dressed as he
     speaks.

                              FERRIS
               His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a
               serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I
               like him. I'm probably his only friend.
               I do what I can for him. I mean, if
               I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others,
               right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.
               His father's dead and his sister's rumored
               to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit.
               She only puts out so people will hang out
               with her. It's sad but I don't hold it
               against her. Better to hold it against the
               guys who use her and don't care about her.
                          (pause)
               My parents never allowed Garth over here.
               It was because of his family. Mainly his
               older brother. He's in jail. I could see them
               not wanting his brother here because he is
               a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.
               I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of
               artificial fruit just so he could see what
               it was like to have his stomach pumped.
               But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault
               that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights
               with the parents on that point. I always felt
               for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once
               and I was laying on the dark worrying that
               his brother was going to come in and hack me
               to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.
               I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing".
               ... Nothing was wrong. There was no
               specific thing he was crying about.
               In fact, he wasn't really even aware that
               he was crying. He just cried himself to
               sleep every night. It was a habit. The
               guy's so conditioned to grief that if
               he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How
               could you possibly dump on guy who has to
               deal with that kinda shit? My parents
               acknowledge the trudge of the situation
               and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel
               for him but still the guy's banned from
               our house.

     He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet
     door. He doesn't like what he's wearing. He continues his
     speech as he disrobes.

                              FERRIS
               Unfortunately, now my parents have a
               legit argument. Garth doesn't need his
               brother to give him a rep anymore. He's
               getting one on his own. He's lost. It's
               over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from
               school. Gone from life. His legacy is
               a gas station.

 17  INT. HOUSE. STAIRCASE                                        17

     Ferris comes down the stairs. He's wearing a completely
     different outfit.

                              FERRIS
               One very serious danger is playing
               sick is that it's possible to believe
               your own act.

 18  INT. KITCHEN                                                 18

     Ferris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the
     refrigerator.

                              FERRIS
               That and boredom. Alot of people
               ditch and feel great for about an
               hour. Then they realize there's
               nothing to do. TV and food. I myself
               have ditched and gotten so bored I
               did homework. Figure that shit out.

     He takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice.

                              FERRIS
               You have to plan things out before
               you take the day off. Otherwise
               you get all nervous worrying about
               what to do and all you get is grief
               and the whole point is to take it
               easy, cut loose and enjoy.

     He crosses to the pantry.

                              FERRIS
               You blow your day and at about three
               o'clock, when everybody's out of school,
               you're going to wish you'd gone to
               school so you could be out having
               fun.

     He emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos.

                              FERRIS
               Avoid the misery. Plan your day.
               Do it right.

 19  INT. FAMILY ROOM                                             19

     Ferris walks in and flops down in an armchair.

                              FERRIS
               There's alot of pressure at work
               in my age group. And it's not always
               recognized.

     He reaches over and picks up the telephone. He sets it in
     his lap.

                              FERRIS
               Some guy whose hair is falling out
               and his stomach's hanging over his
               belt and everything he eats makes
               him fart, he looks at someone like
               me and thinks, "This kid's young and
               strong and has a full, rich future ahead
               of him, what's he got to bitch about?"

 20  CU. PHONE                                                    20

     He punches out a number.

 21  INT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS                                     21

     He remote controls the TV on.

                              FERRIS
               That's just one reason why I need a
               day off every now and then.

 22  EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE                                           22

     A sleek, modern house on a couple of deeply wooded acres. A
     prime house in a prime location. A telephone rings OVER.

 23  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                           23

     It's a dark, dreary sick room. Shades drawn, floor strewn
     with used tissues, nightstand a still-life of over the
     counter remedies. A high school boy, CAMERON FRYE, is laying
     in bed. We don't see his face, only a silhouette with a
     thermometer sticking out his mouth. U2's SUNDAY BLOODY
     SUNDAY is playing. He's mumbling random words.

                              CAMERON
               Food...shelter...no...yes...

     The phone rings. His hand reaches back and hits the speaker
     phone button.

                              CAMERON
                          (weak)
               Hello?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Cameron! What's happening?

                              CAMERON
               Very little.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               How do you feel?

                              CAMERON
               Shredded.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Is your mother in the room?

     Cameron takes the thermometer out of his mouth.

                              CAMERON
               She's not home. Where are you?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Home.

 24  INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS                             24

     Ferris is sprawled out in the chair.

                              FERRIS
               I'm taking the day off. Get
               dressed and come over.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               I can't. I'm sick.

                              FERRIS
               It's all in your head. Come on over.

 25  INT. CAMERON'S ROOM                                          25

     Cameron's insistant.

                              CAMERON
               I feel like complete shit, Ferris.
               I can't go anywhere.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'm sorry to hear that. Now, come
               on over and pick me up.

     Ferris disconnects. Cameron slowly hangs up the phone.

                              CAMERON
               I'm dying.

     The phone rings again. Cameron hits the speaker button.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               You're not dying. You just can't think
               of anything good to do.

 26  INT. FERRIS' FAMILY ROOM                                     26

     Ferris hangs up.

                              FERRIS
               If anybody needs a day off, it's
               Cameron. He has alot of things to
               sort out before he graduates. He
               can't be wound this tight and go
               to college. His roommate'll kill
               him. I've come close myself. But I
               like him. He's a little easier to
               take when you know why he's like he
               is. The boy cannot relax. Pardon
               by French but Cameron is so tight
               that if you stuck a lump of coal up
               his ass, in two weeks you'd have a
               diamond.
                          (after-thought)
               And Cameron would worry that he'd
               owe taxes on it.

 27  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         27

     We hear roll call as CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the tile floor. A
     shoe's POV.

               Here.

     CAMERA enters a classroom. It travels past a teacher's Hush
     Puppies and heads up an aisle of desk past dirty yellow
     Reebocks, rotting Air Jordans, scuffed heels, pristine
     loafers...

                              TEACHER'S VOICE

     CAMERA reaches the last desk and rises slowly to reveal that
     it's empty.

               Bueller?

               He's sick.

               My best friend's sister's boyfriend's
               brother's girlfriend heard from this
               guy who knows this kid who's going
               with a girl who saw Ferris pass-out
               at 31 Flavors last night. I guess
               it's pretty serious.

                              TEACHER'S VOICE
                          (weary)

     WOUND-OUT CAR ENGINES COME UP LOUD.

 28  CU. TV                                                       28

     THE ROAD WARRIOR is playing on video cassette. The big chase
     at the end.

     INT. FAMILY ROOM. FERRIS

     He's sitting in the arm chair pretending it's Humongous' war
     wagon. He's wearing a hockey mash. He's steering. He reaches
     down and grabs an imaginary nitrous oxide valve.

     CU. TV

     Humongous reaches down and grabs a real nitrous oxide valve.
     He gives it a twist.

     CU. FERRIS

     He throws himself back against the chair.

     CU. TV

     The force of the rapid acceleration of his vehicle throws
     Humongous back in his seat.

     CU. FERRIS

     He bounces himself in the chair to simulate the bumpy high
     speed ride.

     CU. TV

     The was wagon hurtles down the road.

     CU. FERRIS

     He rears back in horror.

     CU. TV

     The war wagon is heading for a head-on collision with the
     tanker truck.

     CU. FERRIS

     Arms outstretched, head thrown back, braced for collision.

     CU. TV

     IMPACT!

     MOZART COMES UP.

 29  CU. FLOWERING TREE BRANCH                                    29

     Outside a bedroom window. A flowering crabtree branch.
     Petite pink flowers. WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDOW INTO THE
     ROOM. It's Jeanie's room. A pink and powder blue pig pen.
     Clothes everywhere, make-up, books, records. Ferris is
     sitting on her bed going through a purse.

                          FERRIS
               This is really degrading.

     He comes up with a crumpled dollar bill.

                              FERRIS
               Financing my activities this way.
               Very damaging to the self-image.
               But, hey, I'm broke. In times of
               crisis one must to what one must
               to. I'll pay it back. With interest.

     He comes up with a five.

                              FERRIS
               Regardless of how much shit sisters
               make you eat, how often they rat on
               you, how gross they act or how wicked
               and insensitive they can be, you should
               not alientate them. Because most likely
               they have cash and it's usually very easy
               to get your hands on.

     He holds up a twenty and snaps it. PINK FLOYD'S "MONEY"
     COMES UP.

 30  INT. LIVING ROOM                                             30

     The song plays as Ferris digs through the sofa cushions.

     CU. SOFA

     Ferris extracts a sticky quarter from a crevice.

 31  INT. PARENTS' BEDROOM                                        31

     Ferris is going through his father's pants pockets. Another
     crumpled bill surfaces.

 32  CU. WASHING MACHINE TOP                                      32

     A couple of stiff, hard, bleached singles that have gone
     through the wash lay on top of the washer. A hand scoops
     them up.

 33  CU. LUCITE ENCASED PROOF SET                                 33

     An obvious gift from a grandparent. A U.S. Mint proof set. A
     ten, a five and a single enclosed in a lucite frame. A
     screwdriver tip wedges between the two pieces of Lucite and
     pops them apart. A hand peels the bills off the backing.

 34  CU. KITCHEN DRAWER                                           34

     Hands ripping through the kitchen junk drawer. Locating a
     dollar bill.

 35  CU. COIN COLLECTION                                          35

     The familiar blue collector's album. One-by-one, the
     quarters are being popped out of their slots.

 36  CU. VACCUUM CLEANER                                          36

     The dusty, dirty contents of the bag are emptied on the
     floor. Fingers pick a dime out of a matted wad of filth.

 37  CU. SNOOPY BANK                                              37

     It's being shaken furiously.

 38  CU. BIRTHDAY CARD                                            38

     It's a child's card. It's slowly opened to reveal a crisp,
     new five.

 39  INT. HALL CLOSET                                             39

     The door opens and Ferris thrusts his hands into the pockets
     of the coats. He comes up with a ball of Kleenex. A roll of
     Tums. A squirt gun. Then a modest wad of bills. His face
     lights up as he counts out the cash. He closes the door.

 40  CU. FLOOR AND BED                                            40

     Ferris' face appears between the bed and the floor. His arm
     reaches out for a small metal bank hidden under the bed.

 41  CU. BANK                                                     41

     It's on a work bench. An awl is driven in between the door
     and the jamb. It pries the door open. Inside are trading
     cards, a charred doll's head, a Zippo lighter and, finally,
     a five dollar bill.

 42  INT. KITCHEN                                                 42

     Ferris is on his hands and knees under the kitchen table.

 43  CU. TABLE LEG                                                43

     Ferris lifts the leg and removes a quarter that's been used
     to balance the table.

 44  INT. KITCHEN                                                 44

     Ferris stands up and pockets the quarter.

 45  CU. FERRIS' BED                                              45

     A shower of coins and bills rain down on the sheets. The
     SONG ENDS.

 46  EXT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE. MORNING                             46

     A suburban realty company. A cute little building in town.

 47  INT. OFFICE                                                  47

     Joyce is behind a desk. Across from her are two WOMEN.
     They're also real estate agents.

                              JOYCE
               No one's going to consider a
               house with a black living room.
               Not even those jerks from Vermont.
               Let's be realistic.

                              AGENT 1
               Mrs. Volbeck's dead set against
               putting any money into the house.

     Joyce's phone intercom buzzes. She take the call.

                              JOYCE
               Joyce Bueller.

     Her eyes open wide with alarm.

                              JOYCE
               Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I
               completely forgot to call.

 48  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL                                             48

     A modern, suburban high school.

                              MAN'S VOICE
               Are you aware that your son is not
               in school today?

 49  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         49

     It's a passing period. The hall is clogged with students.

                              JOYCE'S VOICE
               Yes, I am. Ferris is home sick. I
               had a meeting first thing this
               morning. I should have called. It
               completely slipped my mind.

 50  INT. SCHOOL. DEAN'S OUTER OFFICE                             50

     A SECRETARY is at work at her desk. We hear the dean inside
     the office.

                              DEAN'S VOICE
               Are you also aware that Ferris does not
               have what we consider an exemplary
               attendance record?

 51  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. CU. DESK SIGN                            51

     It reads, EDWARD R. ROONEY. DEAD OF STUDENTS. The dean's
     feet are up on the desk, behind the sign. Moderately priced
     dress shoes.

                              JOYCE'S VOICE
               I don't understand.

                              DEAN'S VOICE
               I just had his file up.

     INT. OFFICE. CU. DEAN

     ED ROONEY is sitting behind his desk. He's tough, clean and
     straight as an I-beam. Short, neatly combed hair, suit and
     tie. He's toying with a pencil. He's confident to the point
     of arrogance.

                              ROONEY
               I just has his file up, Mrs. Bueller.

     Behind him is a computer terminal. He removes his feet from
     the desk and turns in his swivel chair.

                              ROONEY
               If Ferris thinks he coast this last
               month and still graduate, he's sorely
               mistaken.

                              JOYCE'S VOICE
               This is all news to me.

     CU. COMPUTER MONITOR

     The monitor on Rooney's desk displays Ferris' records.

                              ROONEY'S VOICE
               So far this semester alone, he's been
               absent nine times. Including today.

                              JOYCE'S VOICE
               Nine times?

     Under DAYS MISSED we see a number 9 suddenly change to a
     number 2.

     INT. OFFICE

     Rooney turns to the monitor. He reads off the screen.

                              ROONEY
               I have it right here in front of me. He's
               missed...

     He looks closer at the screen.

 52  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            52

     Ferris is at his Macintosh computer. He has his record up
     on the screen.

                              FERRIS
               I wanted a car. I got a computer. How's
               that for being born under a bad sign?

 53  INT. JOYCE'S OFFICE                                          53

     She's still on the phone with Rooney.

                              JOYCE
               I can give you every assurance that
               Ferris is home and that he is, in
               fact, very ill. I debated whether
               or not I should even leave him.
               I can appreciate that at this time
               of year children are prone to taking
               the day off, but in Ferris' case,
               he's truly a very sick boy.

 54  INT. FERRIS' BEDROOM                                         54

     MUSIC BLASTS. SOLO GUITAR.

     CU. SPEAKER

     The grille cloth is throbbing.

     CU. LED METERS

     The meters on the amplifier are totally in the danger zone.

     CU. TV MONITOR

     We see Ferris in his room with a guitar around his neck.
     He's playing.

     CU. VIDEO CAMERA

     A home video camera is capturing Ferris on tape.

 55  INT. CAMERON'S ROOM                                          55

     He's sitting on the edge of the bed buttoning his shirt. He
     sighs deeply and fall back on the bed.

 56  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         56

     Jeanie is at her locker during a passing period. A
     GIRLFRIEND comes up to her.

                              GIRL
               I'm really sorry about your brother.

                              JEANIE
               What're you sorry for? I have to live
               with the trouser snake.

                              GIRL
               No, I mean I heard he's really sick.

                              JEANIE
               Who said he's sick.

                              GIRL
               A whole bunch of people. They said
               he's like on the verge of death.

     Jeanie stares incredulously at the girl.

                              GIRL
               This guy in my biology class said
               that if Ferris dies he's giving
               his eyes to Stevie Wonder? He's
               really sweet isn't he?

     She smiles and exits. Jeanie cocks her head in bewilderment.
     She kicks her locker shut.

 57  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            57

     He's in bed on the phone.

                              FERRIS
               A sample of my blood was sent
               to Atlanta to the Center for
               Disease Control. I don't know,
               man, I'm bricking heavily.

                              (to the phone)
               Did you see Alien? When the guy
               had the creature in his stomach?
               It feels like that.

 58  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                         58

     A FRESHMAN BOY is on the pay phone. A couple of his BUDDIES
     are standing at his side waiting anxiously for news.

                              BOY
               Goddamn! Are you kidding?

                              SECOND BOY
               What?

                              BOY
               Did you see Alien?

                              SECOND BOY
               No.

                              BOY
               You never rented the video cassette?

     Second boy shakes his head, no.

                              BOY
               Oh. He's really wasted.

                              THIRD BOY
                          (to the Second Boy)
               Who's he talking to?

                              SECOND BOY
               Ferris Bueller. You know him?

                              THIRD BOY
                          (excited)
               Yeah. He's getting me out of summer
               school.

                              BOY
               Anyway, I appreciate you letting us
               know how you're doing. We gotta split.
                          (pause)
               Huh?...Yeah, sure. Hold on.

                              SECOND BOY
                          (to Third Boy)
               Shit. I hope he doesn't die.
               I can't handle summer school.

     The boy snatches a passing GIRL.

                              BOY
               Did you see Alien?

                              GIRL
               Yeah, why?

     He hands her the phone.

                              GIRL
               Hello?
                          (pause)
               Who?
                          (pause)
               Hi, Ferris. How's your bod?
                          (jaw drops)
               Oh, my God! You're dying?
               Is it serious?
                          (pause)
               Shiit! Are you upset?

 59  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE                                           59

     Rooney's comparing his computer monitor to hard copy. His
     SECRETARY is standing over his shoulder.

                              ROONEY
               I don't trust this kid any further
               than I can throw him!

                              SECRETARY
               With your bad knee, you better
               not throw anybody, Ed.

     Rooney stares at her for a long beat.

                              ROONEY
               What's so dangerous about a character
               like Ferris Bueller is that he gives
               the good kids bad ideas. The last thing
               I need at this point in my career is
               fifteen hundred Ferris Bueller disciples
               running around these halls.

                              SECRETARY
               He's very popular, Ed. Sportos, motorheads,
               geeks, sluts, pinheads, dweebies, wonkers,
               richies, they all adore him.

                              ROONEY
               That's exactly why I have to catch him
               this time. To show these kids that the
               example he sets is a first class ticket
               to nowhere.

                              SECRETARY
                          (impressed)
               Ooo. You sounded like Dirty Harry just
               now.

     Rooney looks up at her with a proud smile.

                              ROONEY
               Really?

     He unconsciously does an Eastwood squint.

 60  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE                                           60

     It's a glorious late spring day. A florist's truck drives
     past the house.

 61  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            61

     He's on the telephone. As he speaks he does a little
     MacPainting on his MacIntosh. A Modigliani nude.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, if you're not over here
               in fifteen minutes, you can find
               a new best friend. I'm serious, man.
               This is bullshit, making me wait
               around the house for you.

 62  INT. CAMERON'S BEDROOM                                       62

     Cameron's back in bed.

                              CAMERON
               I'm sick. I feel like shit. Why can't
               you leave me alone?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               You're not up for some good times?
               It's a beautiful day. It's almost
               summer. If this was Hawaii, we'd be
               surfing.

 63  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            63

     He's growing weary of Cameron's wimpishness.

                              FERRIS
               You want to stay home and try
               to have the shits? Try to barf?
               Try to feel worse?

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               I don't have to try.

                              FERRIS
               Be a man. Take some Pepto Bismol
               and get dressed. You're boring me
               with this stuff.

     The other phone line rings.

                              FERRIS
               Squeeze you buns for a second. I
               got another call.

     He puts Cameron on hold. He clears his throat and answers
     the second line. He sounds like he's on his last breath.

                              FERRIS
               H--hell-o?

 64  EXT. OFFICE BUILDING. DOWNTOWN                               64

     A LaSalle Street office tower.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Ferris?

 65  INT. TOM'S OFFICE                                            65

     He's behind his desk. Nice office. Two windows. Herman
     Miller desk and chair.

                              TOM
               You sound miserable.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Really? Darn! I thought I was improving.

                              TOM
               Were you sleeping?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I was trying to do some homework.

 66  CU. COMPUTER MONITOR                                         66

     A closer view of the rude drawing Ferris is making.

                              FERRIS (OC)
               I'm so worried about falling behind.

     INT. FERRIS' ROOM

     He leans back from the monitor and sips a Coke.

                              FERRIS
               Dad? Can you hold on a second?

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Sure, pal. Are you alright?

                              FERRIS
               Just a little phlegm on the phone.
               Hold on.

     He puts his father on hold.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron? It's my Dad.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               Oh, that's just great. Are you busted?

                              FERRIS
               It's completely cool. He's just
               checking up on me. Now, listen to
               me. I'm working on getting some
               heavy bucks out of him. So, the least you
               can do is hurry up and get over here.
               Bye.

     He disconnects and gets his father back. He switches back to
     his sick voice.

                              FERRIS
               Sorry, Dad. The moment before you
               called, I had a chest spasm and I
               blew lung fluid all over the place.
               It was making me ill looking at it.
               But gee, it's sure great of you to call.
               I'm sure there're alot of fathers
               who wouldn't take time out from
               their busy schedules to call a dumb,
               sick teenager.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Hey, pal, what was I supposed to do?

     Ferris reaches out and hits a key on his computer. The
     screen dumps the drawing.

                              FERRIS
               Give yourself some credit, Dad. It
               was a mammoth gesture. It's like those
               savings bonds you used to give me
               every Christmas.
                          (looks at CAMERA and smiles)
               It was that kind of concern.

     CU. COMPUTER SCREEN

     A message is flashing: "TRANSMITTING DATA".

     INT. FERRIS' ROOM

     He turns away from the computer and puts his feet up on the
     desk. He lights a cigarette.

                              FERRIS
               You had to work hard for the money
               to buy those things, right?

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Not any harder than anybody else.

     Ferris mouths Tom's words as he says them.

 67  EXT. CHICAGO LOOP. DIAMONDVISION SCREEN                      67

     Ferris' drawing suddenly appears on the billboard.
     Pedestrians stop to look.

 68  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            68

     He blows a smoke ring.

                              FERRIS
               You work so hard I'll bet you don't
               even remember where those bonds are,
               right?

     Ferris points a finger in the air as a cue to his father.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Wrong.

     He nods.

                              FERRIS
               Oh, yeah? You're pulling my leg. You're
               just trying to cheer me up.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Like hell I am. They're in a shoebox
               in my closet.

     Ferris smiles. He looks at CAMERA. He's gotten exactly what
     he wants.

                              FERRIS
                          (to CAMERA, normal
                           voice)
               Was that a class move or what?
               The guy gave it up faster than
               a drunk Catholic girl. I hope my
               kids don't pull this shit on me.
                          (thinks)
               Of course, if they didn't, they'd
               be dumb and abnormal and they'd
               probably never move out of my
               house and I'd have to support them
               until I die. I take it back.
                          (to the phone,
                           sick voice)
               Dad? All this talking has made me
               kind of light-headed. I think
               I better lie down.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               Okay, pal. You take care. I'll
               call you after lunch.

                              FERRIS
               You don't have to, Dad.

                              TOM'S VOICE
               I want to. Bye now.

     He hangs up. Ferris sighs.

                              FERRIS
               You win some, you lose some.

     He turns his desk chair around and gets up.

                              FERRIS
               I'm so disappointed in Cameron.
               Twenty bucks says he's sitting
               in his car debating about whether
               or not he should go out.

 69  INT. CAR. CAMERON                                            69

     He's sitting behind the wheel of his car.

                              CAMERON
               We're gonna get caught. No doubt
               about it.

     He cuts the engine.

                              CAMERON
               I'm not doing it.

     He sits for half a beat.

                              CAMERON
               He'll keep calling until I come
               over.

     He sighs and restarts the engine. Another beat.

                              CAMERON
               Actually, what'll happen is I'll
               get caught. Ferris'll escape.

     Another beat. He stops the engine. A CRASH OF HORROR MUSIC.

 70  CU. DRESSER DRAWER                                           70

     Hands curl around the drawer pulls. The drawer is opened
     slowly, ominously. The hands lift a sweater out. A HERALDIC
     STING as we see a men's magazine beneath the sweater.

     INT. FERRIS' ROOM

     He takes out the magazine. He leafs through the pages for
     the pictorials as he speaks.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron'll go on like that for a
               good thirty minutes. The guy
               is a shellfish when it comes to
               making a decision. The reason
               he doesn't fell good is, he
               worries about everything. He's
               the only guy I know who's deeply
               concerned that when he grows up
               there'll be a critical shortage
               of strategic metals.

     He exits the room.

 71  INT. HALLWAY                                                 71

     Ferris comes out of his room and heads down the hallway.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron's also the only guy
               I know who knows what strategic
               metals are.
                          (waves the magazine)
               Pardon moi.

     He goes into the bathroom. We HEAR THE TOILET SEAT SLAM
     DOWN.

                              FERRIS
                          (sings)
               MAYBE I'M JUST LIKE MY MOTHER,
               SHE'S NEVER SATISFIED...

 72  INT. CLASSROOM. LATER                                        72

     A stunningly beautiful girl, SLOANE PETERSON, is sitting at
     her desk in a history class. She's staring out the window as
     a tweedy MALE TEACHER delivers a dry, dusty lecture.

                              TEACHER
               Roosevelt's health had seriously
               deteriorated by the time he met
               with Churchill and Stalin at Yalta.
                          (sneezes)
               Pardon me.

     The classroom door opens and the school NURSE walks in. For
     a moment, the teacher thinks she's come in because she heard
     him sneeze. She crosses to him and whispers in his ear.

     SLOANE

     She, like the others, watches the nurse curiously.

     INT. CLASSROOM. TEACHER AND NURSE

     The teacher's face drops as he's delivered an obvious piece
     of disturbing news. He nods grimly to the Nurse. She looks
     at the kids.

                              NURSE
               Sloane Peterson?

     SLOANE

     Sits up in her seat.

     NURSE

     She's a picture of compassion and understanding.

                              NURSE
               May I see you outside for a moment?
               There's been an emergency.

     SLOANE

     A smile curls across her lips. As she gathers her books she
     looks to the GIRL next to her.

                              SLOANE
                          (whispers)
               Dead grandmother.

 73  INT. HALLWAY                                                 73

     The Nurse is gently holding Sloane's hand.

                              NURSE
                          (nods solemnly)
               Dead grandmother.

 74  CU. ROONEY                                                   74

     He has a suspicious look on his face.

                              ROONEY
               Dead grandmother?

     INT. DEAN'S OFFICE

     Rooney's at his desk. His secretary is standing across from
     him.

                              SECRETARY
               That's what Mr. Peterson said. I
               had Florence Sparrow notify Sloane.

                              ROONEY
               Who's this girl's going with?

                              SECRETARY
               It's so hard to tell. I see her
               alot with Ferris Bueller.

     Rooney smiles. His suspicions are confirmed.

                              ROONEY
               Could you get me Mr. Peterson's
               daytime number?

     As the secretary starts out of the room, Rooney's phone
     rings. She stops and answers the desk phone.

                              SECRETARY
               Edward Rooney's office.
                          (pause)
               Yes. Can you hold? Thank you.

     She puts the call on hold.

                              SECRETARY
               It's Mr. Peterson.

     Rooney is startled. He thinks for a beat then reaches for
     the phone.

                              SECRETARY
               Do you still want his number?

     Rooney answers her with an annoyed look. She smiles and
     backs out. He punches the phone button.

                              ROONEY
               Ed Rooney.

                              MAN'S VOICE
               Ed? This is George Peterson.

                              ROONEY
               How are you today, sir?

                              MAN'S VOICE
               We've had a bit of bad luck this
               morning as you may have heard.

     Rooney rolls his eyes. It's so obvious it's not Mr.
     Peterson.

                              ROONEY
               I heard. And, gosh, I'm all broken
               up. Huh? Oh, sure. I'd be happy to
               release Sloane. You produce a corpse
               and I'll release Sloane. I want to
               see this dead grandmother firsthand.

     The secretary stops cold in the doorway. She turns to Rooney
     in horror. He covers the phone.

                              ROONEY
                          (whispers)
               It's Ferris Bueller. Nervy litttle
               punk. I'm gonna set a trap and let
               his walk right into it!
                          (to phone)
               That's right. Cart the stiff in and
               I'll turn over your daughter. It's
               school policy. Was this your mother?

     Rooney's other line rings.

 75  INT. SECRETARY'S OFFICE                                      75

     She steps out of Rooney's office and picks up the other
     line.

                              SECRETARY
               Ed Rooney's office.

     Her jaw drops.

                              SECRETARY
               Hold, please.

     She puts the call on hold and hangs up. She hurried into
     Rooney's office.

 76  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE                                           76

     Rooney's chewing out the person on the other line.

                              ROONEY
               I'll tell you want, you don't
               like my policies, you can just
               come on down and smooch by big
               old ugly ass. You hear me?

     The secretary comes in. She's waving her arms furiously.
     Rooney tries to wave her away. He's angry. She stomps her
     foot. Rooney covers the phone.

                              ROONEY
               What!?

                              SECRETARY
               Ferris Bueller's on line two.

     CU. ROONEY'S FOOT

     It freezes in mid-tap.

     CU. ROONEY'S HAND

     The pencils falls from his fingers.

     CU. ROONEY'S FACE

     A mask of horror. He glances at the phone.

     CU. PHONE

     The second line light is flashing.

     CU. ROONEY

     He blinks, cocks his head, twitches.

 77  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                            77

     He's zipping his pants, fastening his belt. The phone's
     cradled against his shoulder. He speaks in the same voice he
     used on his father.

                              FERRIS
               Mr. Rooney? I'm sorry to disturb
               you at work but I was wondering if
               it would be possible for my sister
               to bring home any assignments from
               my classes that I may need.

 78  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. ROONEY                                   78

     He's staring blankly ahead.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Thank you, sir.

     He nods.

     CU. PHONE

     Rooney's finger gingerly presses the button on the waiting
     call.

     CU. ROONEY

     He winces as he returns to the first call.

 79  INT. FERRIS' HOUSE. KITCHEN                                  79

     Cameron's on the phone in the kitchen. He's doing a deep,
     phoney "father" voice.

                              CAMERON
               You oughta be sorry for Christ's
               sake! A family member dies and
               you insult me. What's the matter
               with you, anyway?

 80  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE. ROONEY                                   80

     He apologies profusely to Cameron. He's perspiring,
     trembling.

                              ROONEY
               I don't know. I thought you were
               someone else. You have to know,
               sir, that I would never deliberately
               insult you. I can't begin to tell
               you how embarrassed I am.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               Pardon my French but you're an asshole!

     Rooney nods enthusiastically.

                              ROONEY
               Absolutely! I most certainly am.

 81  INT. KITCHEN                                                 81

     Cameron lays into Rooney.

                              CAMERON
               This isn't over yet, buster. You
               just make sure my daughter's out
               in front of the school in ten
               minutes. Do you read me?

                              ROONEY'S VOICE
               Load and clear, Mr. Peterson.

                              CAMERON
               Call me sir, goddamn it!

                              ROONEY'S VOICE
               Sir.

                              CAMERON
               That's better.

     Ferris strolls into the kitchen to catch the last of the
     conversation. Cameron covers the phone.

                              CAMERON
                          (to Ferris)
               I'm scared shitless, Ferris! What
               is Rooney guesses my voice!

                              FERRIS
               Impossible. You're doing great.

     Cameron sighs and goes back to the phone.

                              CAMERON
                          (clears his throat)
               I don't have all day to bark at you
               so I'll make this short and sweet.

     Ferris gives Cameron an enthusiastic thumbs up.

                              FERRIS
                          (mouths)
               Great!

     Cameron smiles proudly.

                              CAMERON
               I want my daughter out in front
               of the school in ten minutes. By
               herself. I don's want anyone around...

     Ferris smacks Cameron. He's said the wrong thing. He covers
     the phone.

                              CAMERON
               What'd I do?

                              FERRIS
               Out in front my herself? It's too
               suspicious! He'll think something's
               up, moron. Cover it.

     Cameron panics. He holds the phone out to Ferris.

                              CAMERON
               You do it!

     Ferris waves his arms angrily.

                              FERRIS
               Talk!

     Cameron takes a deep breath. He clears his throat and puts
     on his father's voice.

                              CAMERON
               I changed my mind, fella. You be out
               in front with her! I wanna have a
               few words with you!

     Ferris slaps Cameron. The phone flies out of his hand.

 82  CU. ROONEY                                                   82

     He winces as the phone hits the floor with a loud CLONK!
     We HEAR THE BOYS SCRAMBLING TO PICK UP THE PHONE, THEN
     CAMERON CLEARING HIS THROAT.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               On second thought, I don't have
               time to talk to you. We'll get
               together soon and have lunch.

     We HEAR A SLAP AND THE CALL DISCONNECTS.

 83  INT. FERRIS' KITCHEN                                         83

     Cameron's rubbing the side of his head.

                              CAMERON
               Why'd you hit me?!

                              FERRIS
               Where's your brain?!

                              CAMERON
               Why'd you hit me?!

                              FERRIS
               Where's your brain?!

                              CAMERON
               Why'd you hit me?

                              FERRIS
               Where's your brain?

                              CAMERON
               I asked you first.

                              FERRIS
               How can we pick up Sloane if Rooney's
               going to be there with her?!

                              CAMERON
               I said for her to be there alone
               and you freaked!

                              FERRIS
               My, God, you're so stupid!
                          (aside)
               I didn't hit you, I lightly slapped
               you.

                              CAMERON
               You hit me. Look, don't ask me to
               participate in your crap if you
               don't like the way I do it!

     Ferris is incredulous at Cameron's stupidity. Cameron's
     anger is intensified by his embarrassment.

                              CAMERON
               I was home, sick. You get me out of
               bed, being me over here, make me
               jeopardize my future, make me do
               a phoney phone call on a dean of
               students, a man who could squeeze
               my nuts into oblivion and then
               you deliberately hurt my feelings.

                              FERRIS
               I didn't deliberately hurt your feelings.

                              CAMERON
               Oh, really?

                              FERRIS
               Yeah, really.

     Cameron glares at Ferris.

                              CAMERON
               Hey, Ferris? Have a nice life.

     He turns and heads out of the room. Ferris sighs.
                              FERRIS
               Cameron?

                              CAMERON
               Stick it up your ass, Ferris.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
               to jam you. It was uncalled for.

     Cameron stops.

                              CAMERON
               You're serious?

     He turns around.

                              FERRIS
               Dead serious.

     Cameron smiles. He appreciates Ferris apology.

                              CAMERON
               Thanks.

                              FERRIS
               You did screw up through, right?
               Not that is was necessarily all
               you fault. Right?

                              CAMERON
                          (suspiciously)
               Why?

                              FERRIS
               To fix this situation, I'm going
               to have to ask you for a small favor.

     Cameron's jaw drops.

 84  INT. GARAGE                                                  84

     The door opens slowly, dramatically as we hear a heraldic
     fanfare. Light streams in to reveal Cameron and Ferris
     looking at the car. Ferris is smiling with excitement and
     awe. Cameron is frowning with trepidation and fear.

     CU. FERRARI STALLION

     The prancing black stallion. We move up from the stallion to
     the erotic red hood of a 1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California.

     CAMERON AND FERRIS

     Cameron's face is ashen. The end of the world is at hand.
     Ferris is in heaven.

                              CAMERON
                          (grim monotone)
               1958 Ferrari 250 GTS California. Less
               than a hundred were made. It has a
               market value of $265,000. My father
               spent three years restoring it. It
               is joy, it is his love, it is his
               passion.

                              FERRIS
               It is his fault he didn't lock the
               garage.

                              CAMERON
               Ferris, my father loves this car more
               than life itself. We can't take is out.

                              FERRIS
               A man with priorities so far out of
               whack doesn't deserve such a fine
               automobile.

                              CAMERON
               He never drives it, Ferris. He just
               rubs it with a diaper.

                              FERRIS
               We can't pick up Sloane in your car,
               Cameron. Rooney'd never believe Mr.
               Peterson drives that piece of shit.

                              CAMERON
               It's not a piece of shit.

                              FERRIS
               It's a piece of shit. Don't worry
               about it. I don't even have a piece
               of shit. I have to envy yours. Look,
               I'm sorry but there's nothing else
               we can do.

                              CAMERON
               He knows the mileage, Ferris. He has
               it tatooed on his wrist.

                              FERRIS
               He doesn't trust you?

                              CAMERON
               No.

                              FERRIS
               Alright, look, this is real simple.
     He puts his arm around Cameron.

                              FERRIS
               Whatever miles we put on it, we'll
               take off.

                              CAMERON
                          (suspicious)
               How?

                              FERRIS
                          (big, proud smile)
               We'll drive home backwards.

     Cameron shakes his head, no.

                              CAMERON
               Forget it. I'm putting my foot down,
               Ferris. You'll have to think of
               something else...

     CU. FERRARI GRILLE

     Cameron's protests are drowned out by the distinctive roar
     of the twelve cylinders.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               ...You're not talking me into this
               one. I have to live with the man.
               I'm sorry but...

     The roar of the engine is overtaken by the sound of a
     crowded school hallway.

 85  INT. SCHOOL. JEANIE                                          85

     She comes out of a classroom. She stops as Sloane and Rooney
     walk past. Sloane has her coat on and she's carrying her
     books. Jeanie watches her suspiciously.

 86  EXT. SCHOOL                                                  86

     The Ferrari is parked out in front. The top is down.

 87  INT. FERRARI                                                 87

     Ferris is driving. He's wearing a man's hat and sunglasses.
     Cameron's in the back.

                              CAMERON
               Are you crazy?! Put the top back
               up!

                              FERRIS
               This is perfect top-down weather.
                              CAMERON
               What about Rooney?

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, the more obvious we are,
               the less likely we are to get
               caught.

                              CAMERON
               That makes no sense whatsoever.

                              FERRIS
               The adult mind is a suspicious
               machine.
                          (look around at Cameron)
               Stay down, man.

     Cameron squeezes himself lower.

                              CAMERON
               Howcome it's my Dad's car and
               I'm taking all the risk and I have
               to ride back here?

                              FERRIS
               I don't have an explanation.

 88  EXT. SCHOOL                                                  88

     Rooney and Sloane come out the door.

                              ROONEY
               Once again let me say how deeply
               saddened I am by your loss.

                              SLOANE
               Huh?

                              ROONEY
               Were you close to your grandmother?

                              SLOANE
               Oh. Um. Yeah. Very. She was a terrific
               lady. Very hip. Very old. Yeah.

                              DEEP VOICE
               Oh, Sloane! Dear!

     Sloane looks across at the Ferrari. Rooney looks.

     THEIR POV

     Ferris is looking out across the roof of the Ferrari. He's
     careful to keep his nose and mouth below the roofline.

                              FERRIS
               Hurry along now!

     EXT. SCHOOL

     Rooney's suspicious. Sloane smiles and bids Rooney a hasty
     farewell.

                              SLOANE
               I guess that's my Dad. Thanks.
               See ya.

     She hurries to the car. Rooney watches her. Something does
     compute for him.

 89  INT. SCHOOL. JEANIE                                          89

     She's watching out the door. She sees the Ferrari pull away.

 90  EXT. SCHOOL. ROONEY                                          90

     He can't quite put his finger on what's bothering him.

 91  INT. FERRARI                                                 91

     Sloane shrieks with delight. She leans across the console
     and gives Ferris a kiss.

                              SLOANE
               This is so great! I can't believe
               it! Right in front of Rooney!

     She laughs and turns to Cameron.

                              SLOANE
               Hi, Cameron. You comfortable?

                              CAMERON
               Hi. No.

                              SLOANE
               What a fabulous car!

                              CAMERON
               Enjoy it quick. It' s going home.

                              FERRIS
               It was risky, it was bold but
               it was totally necessary.

                              SLOANE
               What're we gonna do?

                              FERRIS
               The question isn't "what are we
               gonna do", the question is "what
               aren't we going to do."

                              CAMERON
               Don't tell me we're not going to
               take the car home. Please.

                              FERRIS
                          (to CAMERA)
               If you had access to a car like this
               would you take it back right away?
               Would you give up feeling like a
               ton just to ease your best friend's
               tension?

     He smiles.

                              FERRIS
               Either would I.

 92  EXT. STREET. FERRARI                                         92

     It accelerates away like a shot.

 93  EXT. SUBURBAN BANK                                           93

     A fresh, modern bank building. The clock outside read 9:53.
     The Ferrari pulls into the parking lot.

 94  INT. BANK. DOORS                                             94

     Ferris, Cameron and Sloane walk in. Ferris is cocky and
     confident. Sloane's still intoxicated with her freedom.
     Cameron's having stomach trouble. Ferris leads the way to an
     open teller window.

     INT. BANK. TELLER

     A WOMAN about seventy with a silver blue beehive. It's about
     four inches higher the highest beehive you're ever seen. As
     she moves the beehive hits a small sign over her head. She's
     been at the bank since they opened. She smiles when she sees
     Ferris.

                              TELLER
               Ferris Bueller?

     FERRIS

     He's at the window. On either shoulder are Cameron and
     Sloane. Ferris smiles. Cameron blanches.

                              FERRIS
               Hello, Mrs. Froeling. How are you?

     TELLER

     She pats the rock-solid mass of blue hair. In doing so she
     locates a missing ball point pen. She withdraws it from the
     hair and smiles at it's reappearance.

                              TELLER
               I passed a kidney stone Tuesday, so
               I'm a little pooped but other than
               that, I'm as chipper as can be.
                          (something occurs to her)
               Say, should you be in school?

     FERRIS

     He lays his savings bonds on the counter.

                              FERRIS
               Me?
                          (polite laugh)
               I'm out of school, Mrs. Froeling.
               In fact. I'm married. This is my
               wife...Madonna.

     Sloane suppresses a laugh.

                              FERRIS
                          (to Cameron)
               And this is my brother-in-law,
               ZZ Top. ZZ, this is Mrs. Froeling.

     Cameron isn't amused.

                              TELLER
                          (to Cameron)
               Is Top a Slavic name?

                              CAMERON
               Yeah.

                              FERRIS
               I'd like to cash these in, please.
               We're having a baby and we need the
               cash for a crib, clothes, diapers,
               food pellets, leash, water dish...

     INT. BANK. TELLER WINDOW

     Mrs. Froeling takes the bonds with a hearty smile. The
     latter part of the conversation sails over her like a line
     drive.

                              TELLER
               A baby!
                          (to Sloane)
               You must be so excited.

     Cameron groans and turns away from the sham.

                              SLOANE
               I'm thrilled, ma'am. I'm especially
               looking forward to wearing those
               jeans with the stretch panel in
               front.

     Mrs. Froeling thumbs through the bonds.

                              TELLER
               Are you hoping for a boy or
               a girl?

                              SLOANE
               Actually, we're hoping for a car.

     CU. CAMERON

     He's spooked by the games playing. He scans the bank
     nervously. He blinks, focuses, blinks again.

     HIS POV

     Joyce is with a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE and their bored,
     sour-puss teenage son, BOYD. He's sitting in a chair with
     his legs slung over the sides waving a Bic lighter back and
     forth across his rump. The parents are Joyce's clients from
     Vermont. A LOAN OFFICER is discussing the local financing
     situation with them. His is an open office adjacent to the
     teller windows. Joyce's back is to the tellers.

     CU. CAMERON

     It's like he's just witnesses an ax murder.

                              CAMERON
               Shit...

     INT. BANK. JOYCE

     Her back is to the teller windows. She's conducting her
     meeting. Behind her we see Cameron grab Ferris and point her
     out to him. He waves. Cameron slaps his arm.

     INT. BANK. TELLER WINDOW

     Mrs. Froeling shows Ferris the savings bonds.

                              TELLER
               These bonds aren't mature. If you hold
               onto them another two years you'll get
               an additional four dollars...

                              FERRIS
               I'm aware of that.

                              TELLER
               You're throwing away four dollars.

                              FERRIS
               No, ma'am, I'm giving it to the
               government. They need it. Do you
               know what an aircraft carrier's
               going for these days?

     INT. BANK. JOYCE

     She concludes her meeting. She shakes hands with the loan
     officer and stands. The Vermont Couple stands. Boyd scrapes
     the bottom of his shoe on the desk, leaving a glob of mud
     behind and he stands. Joyce turns into the bank. Ferris,
     Cameron and Sloane are gone. She escorts her customers out.

     INT. BANK. DOOR

     Joyce and the Vermont Couple approach the doors. Boyd lays a
     luggie in the drinking fountain. Mrs. Froeling passes with
     the savings bonds. She stops when she sees Joyce.

                              JOYCE
               Mrs. Froeling, how are you?

                              MRS. FROELING
               I passed a kidney stone Tuesday.
                          (shifts gears, to Joyce)
               Say, you must be very proud.

     Joyce doesn't know what she's talking about.

                              MRS. FROELING
                          (whispers)
               I met Madonna.

     She pats Joyce on the arm.

                              MRS. FROELING
               She told me everything. Keep me posted,
               I'll want to send a gift.

     She toodles on her way. Joyce and the Vermont Couple are
     completely baffled.

 95  EXT. BANK                                                    95

     Joyce and the Vermont Couple walk along the side of the
     bank, heading for the parking lot. Boyd's tagging along
     behind. He picks up a stone and hurls it into the parking
     lot.

                              JOYCE
               My son's home sick today. If
               you wouldn't mind, on our way
               back to the office, I'd like
               to just run in and check up on him.

     We HEAR A METALLIC PING! as Boyd's missle hits a car.

                              MOTHER
               Of course.

     They pass a show window. As they pass, we hold on the
     window. It's promoting saving for college educations. A
     mannequin father is congratulating his mannequin son in a
     mortar and gown as a stiff Sloane, Ferris and Cameron look
     on proudly.

 96  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE                                           96

     His secretary is dialing a number for him.

                              SECRETARY
               This is the Peterson's home.

     She hands the phone to Rooney.

                              SECRETARY
               Watch your mouth this time.

     Rooney glares at her.

                              ROONEY
               Ferris Bueller's behind this. There's
               no doubt in my mind. That's what I was
               saying this morning. Why he has to be stopped.
               He's got Sloane Peterson involved in this
               thing now. See?

     The secretary nods.

                              SECRETARY
               And her grandmother, too.

 97  CU. PHONE ANSWER MACHINE                                     97

     It clicks on. We hear a grieved woman's voice. It sounds an
     awful lot like Sloane.

                              SLOANE
               We can't come to the phone right now.
               We've had a death in the family. If
               you need to reach us we'll be at
               the following number...

 98  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE                                           98

     Rooney quickly takes down a number.

 99  EXT. CAMERON'S HOUSE                                         99

     His answering machine clicks on. We hear Cameron's voice.

                              CAMERON'S VOICE
               You have reached the Coughlin Bros.
               Mortuary. We are unable to come to
               the phone right now but if you'll leave
               your name and number...

100  INT. DEAN'S OFFICE                                          100

     Rooney hangs up the phone.

                              ROONEY
               Something's going on, goddamn it.

     The secretary's looking at a newspaper on Rooney's desk.
     She's not listening to him.

                              SECRETARY
               There's a railroad strike.

                              ROONEY
               And I'm going to stop it!

                              SECRETARY
               My brother-in-law'll appreciate it.

     Rooney looks at her, puzzled.

                              ROONEY
               What?

                              SECRETARY
               My brother-in-law rides the train
               to work.

     Rooney stares at her like she's crazy.

                              ROONEY
               Who gives a good goddamn?

101  EXT. EDENS EXPRESSWAY                                       101

     The major thoroughfare into the city of Chicago from the
     suburbs. The Ferrari streaks past. In the distance we see
     the Sears Tower, the Hancock Building and the Standard Oil
     Building.

102  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                        102

     Jeanie's walking down the hall. She's stopped by a KID with
     a Coke can.

                              KID
               Yo. We're collecting money to
               buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney.

     Jeanie stares at him. She's flabbergasted at the proportions
     her brother's scan has reached.

                              KID
               They run about fifty g's so it
               you could help out...

                              JEANIE
               Go piss up a flagpole!

                              KID
               Huh?

     She knocks the can out of his hands and storms down the hall.
     The kid yells after her.

                              KID
               Hey, babe! Some day you might
               need a favor from Ferris Bueller!
               Then where'll you be?!

     He reaches for the can.

                              KID
               Heartless wench...

103  EXT. CHICAGO LOOP. PARKING GARAGE                           103

     The Ferrari pulls into a large parking garage.

     EXT. GARAGE

     Ferris, Sloane and Cameron get out. Cameron's having fits.

                              CAMERON
               We can't leave the car here!

                              FERRIS
               Why not?
                              CAMERON
               Because we can't! I want it back
               home where it belongs!

                              SLOANE
               What could happen to it?

                              CAMERON
               It could get stolen, wrecked, scratched,
               you name it.

                              FERRIS
               I'll give the guy a five to watch it.

                              CAMERON
               What guy?

     CU. PARKING ATTENDANT

     He smiles with relish at the car. 6'6", 240. An IQ that
     equals his hourly wage. Shoulder-length hair stuffed into a
     hairnet Gold teeth. Earring. Goatee.

     EXT. PARKING LOT

     The Attendant swaggers over to the car. Ferris slips him a
     give.

                              FERRIS
               You speak English?

                              ATTENDANT
               Since I was three.

                              FERRIS
               Great. I want to you take extra special
               care of this vehicle, okay?

     He pats the Attendant on the arm. He smiles.

                              ATTENDANT
               Like it's a beautiful woman.

                              FERRIS
               I appreciate it.

     The Attendant very gingerly gets into the car. Ferris turns
     to Cameron. The Ferrari pulls into the lot very slowly, very
     carefully. No squealing tires, no revving engine.

                              FERRIS
               See what a finski can do to
               a person's attitude? He's going
               to treat it like a beautiful
               woman.

                              CAMERON
               Yeah, sure. Whip it with a stick
               and piss on the hood.

                              SLOANE
               Oh, please, Cameron. Do you have to
               be so graphic?

     She heads down the street.

                              SLOANE
               This is so right!

     Ferris nudges Cameron on. They exit the garage and head
     after Sloane. A long beat and the Ferrari creeps down the
     exit ramp of the garage. It's gone in the entrance and out
     the exit. Another attendant jumps in the passenger side.
     He's skinny, tall, with a huge knit hat willed with dreads.
     He lets out a spirited laugh and the Ferrari peels out of
     the lot. It heads down the street away from Sloane, Ferris
     and Cameron.

104  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE                                          104

     Joyce's care pulls in the driveway. She gets out and heads up
     the house.

105  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                           105

     It's dark. There's a figure in the bed. We hear soft
     snoring. A wire runs from under the bed covers to the closet
     door to the door to the room itself.

     INT. ROOM. DOOR KNOB

     The wire is tied to the doorknob. It's taut. Downstairs, we
     hear a door open and close.

106  INT. HOUSE. STAIRWAY                                        106

     Joyce quietly walks up the stairs.

107  INT. HOUSE. HALLWAY                                         107

     Joyce comes up the stairs and crosses to Ferris' room. She
     listens at the door. WE HEAR THE SNORING.

     CU. DOORKNOB

     Joyce slowly turns the doorknob and pushes the door open a
     crack.

     HER POV

     The door opens and the figure-like lump in the bed moves.

     CU. JOYCE

     She smiles and closes the door.

108  INT. ROOM. CLOSET                                           108

     The closet door is open. The wire from the bedroom door is
     strung over the top of the closet door. A trophy is attached
     to the end of the wire and it's resting on a yard stick. As
     the bedroom door closes, the trophy lifts up off the
     yardstick and the lump in the bed goes back down to it's
     original position.

     CU. FERRIS' SYNTHESIZER

     Little LED's are lighting up to the rhythm of the snoring.
     The snoring it simulated.

109  INT. HALLWAY                                                109

     Joyce listens at the door another beat. She's smiles with
     relief and affection.

110  EXT. SEARS TOWER. LATER                                     110

     HELICOPTER SHOT moves in on the world's tallest building. As
     it passes we see three figures pressed against the windows.

                              FERRIS (VO)
               This is the world's tallest building.
               From our vantage point here on the
               103 floor, we are provided with a
               view of four states.

                              CAMERON (VO)
               Do you think the car's alright?

                              FERRIS (VO)
               Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and
               my personal favorite, Indiana.

111  INT. SEARS TOWER OBSERVATION DECK                           111

     Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are standing against the window.

                              CAMERON
               I don't feel good, Ferris. Are
               we gonna stay long?

                              FERRIS
               Take a step back...

     Ferris steps back. Sloane and Cameron follow suit.

                              FERRIS
               Now, lean against the glass. Like
               this...

     He leans forward, putting all his weight on his forehead.

                              FERRIS
               And look down.

     Sloane leans forward. Cameron follows, reluctantly.

                              SLOANE
               Oh, shit!

     HER POV

     The street far, far below. A dizzying view.

     INT. OBSERVATION DECK

     The three are leaning against the glass.

                              SLOANE
               What if the glass gives?

                              FERRIS
               Death.

                              SLOANE
               Cool.

     CU. CAMERON

     He's looking down.

                              CAMERON
               I think I see my Dad.

112  EXT. STREET LEVEL                                           112

     A middle-aged man, Cameron's father, HORACE FRYE, is
     standing on the street corner. He's lean, clean, tough and
     humorless. He's wearing a puzzled look on his face.

                              CAMERON'S FATHER
               I think I see my car.

     HIS POV

     The Ferrari screams down the avenue and disappears down the
     underground ramp.

113  INT. SEARS TOWER LOBBY                                      113

     Ferris and Sloane bound down the escalator. Cameron follows
     glumly. They dance past the giant Calder mobile. They're
     singing.

                              FERRIS AND SLOANE
               I BEEN ALL 'ROUND THIS GREAT BIG WORLD
               AND I'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF GIRLS
               YEAH, BUT I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET
               BACK IN THE STATES
               BACK TO THE CUTEST GIRLS IN THE WORLD
               I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA
               I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA

114  EXT. STREET                                                 114

     Ferris and Sloane burst out the doors garnering the annoyed
     stares of the business people busily going in and out of the
     building. Cameron politely waits his turn to exit. Ferris
     and Sloane head down the street. Cameron follows.

                              FERRIS AND SLOANE
               I WISH THEY ALL COULD BE CALIFORNIA GIRLS!

115  EXT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE                            115

     Giant old monolith.

116  INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE. TRADING ROOM              116

     Traders are frantically buying and selling commodities.

117  INT. GALLERY                                                117

     Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are sitting in the gallery
     watching the proceedings.

                              SLOANE
               Do you love me?

                              FERRIS
               Do you love me?

                              SLOANE
               I asked you first.

                              FERRIS
               Yes. You?

                              SLOANE
               Yes.

                              FERRIS
               Would I trash a day of education to
               be with you if I didn't love you?

                              SLOANE
               Yes.

                              FERRIS
               Would I risk damaging a deep and
               wonderfully enriching relationship
               with my parents if I didn't love you?

                              SLOANE
               Yes.

                              FERRIS
               Would I have introduced you as my wife
               if I didn't love you?

                              SLOANE
               Wait a minute. That was a lie.

                              FERRIS
               True.

     Ferris puts his arm around Sloane.

                              FERRIS
               Would you want to get married? I
               mean if I wasn't an asshole.

                              SLOANE
               Sure.

                              FERRIS
                          (serious)
               Today?

     Sloane stares at him. Is he serious.

                              FERRIS
               I'm game.

                              SLOANE
               No way!

                              FERRIS
               I'll do it, if you will.

     Cameron suddenly adds his two cents.

                              CAMERON
               You need a blood test.

     Ferris looks around at him.

                              FERRIS
               Huh?

                              CAMERON
               If your blood's not compatible,
               you could produce a pinhead. The
               state requires a blood test.

                              FERRIS
               So?

                              CAMERON
               So, you can't get married today.

                              FERRIS
               Tomorrow?

                              CAMERON
               If you get a blood test today.

                              SLOANE
               I'm not getting married.

                              CAMERON
               I'm with you, babe.

                              FERRIS
               Why not?

                              SLOANE
               What do you mean, why not? Think
               about it.

                              FERRIS
               Besides being too young and your
               father hating my guts and not
               having any place to live and feeling
               awkward about being the only cheer-
               leader with a husband, give me a
               good reason why not.

                              CAMERON
               I'll give you two. My mother and
               father.

     Ferris and Sloane look at him curiously.

                              CAMERON
               They're married and they hate each other.
                          (to Ferris)
               You've seen them. Am I right?

                              FERRIS
               You're father's a toad and your
               Mom's always wired out, but so what?
               They're old. That's natural.

                              CAMERON
               It makes me puke. Seeing people
               treat each other like that. It's
               like the car. He loves the car.
               He hates his wife.

                              SLOANE
               My parents are divorced. So what?
               It's not like it doesn't happen
               ten thousand times a day.

                              CAMERON
               Just because it happens doesn't
               make it right. Are you comfortable
               with it?

                              SLOANE
               No. It's not something I can get comfortable
               with. I've tried. Are yours divorced?

                              CAMERON
               They may as well be.

                              SLOANE
               Do you think they're staying together
               because of you?

     Cameron hasn't seen it that way. He shrugs.

                              SLOANE
               Do they like you?

     It hasn't occured to Cameron that his parents might not like
     him. That parental love might not be a given.

                              CAMERON
               Yeah. Sure.

                              SLOANE
               Consider this...my father canned me
               and my brother and my Mom for a
               twenty five year old dipso with fake
               tits. He dropped us like a rock. Everything
               was cool at our house. I thought so.
               We all thought so. Then BLAM! It's over.

                              FERRIS
                          (to CAMERA)
               This is all news to me. She keeps a
               pretty good secret.

                              SLOANE
                          (to Cameron)
               It was pure selfishness. When I have
               a kid, I don't care how much I want
               something, if it's gonna screw-up the
               kid, forget it.

                              FERRIS
                          (to CAMERA)
               She's not lying.

                              CAMERON
               You could change.

                              SLOANE
               Yeah. But I'm gonna try not to.
               I'm gonna think about it. I'm
               gonna try to prevent it.

                              FERRIS
               This is optomism. It's a common
               trait with my age group. Adults
               think it's cute, it's like a charming
               quick that infests youth. But it's
               a cool thing and I think, deep down,
               crusty old shits wish they had some.
               They wish they had her, too.
                          (points to Sloane)
               Sorry. She's taken.

                              CAMERON
               I'd rather not have my family break
               apart, thank you.

                              SLOANE
               Well, you know what? It ain't up
               to you. It's out of your hands.

                              CAMERON
               So, I in other words, I should just
               sit back and watch it crumble?

                              SLOANE
               You're merely an inhabitant in their
               universe.

                              FERRIS
               Frightening choice of words.

                              SLOANE
               They call the shots. When you split
               from them, you call the shots.

                              CAMERON
               So, you're saying I should run away?

                              FERRIS
               No. She's saying it's time for lunch.

                              SLOANE
               What?

                              FERRIS
               Let's go feed Cameron.

     They stand up and head out. Ferris hangs back a moment. He
     cups his hands to his mouth. He yells at the top of his
     voice.

                              FERRIS
               BUY!

     And he exits. Cool and casual.

118  INT. CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE.  TRADING FLOOR            118

     It explodes with activity in response to Ferris' shout.
     We HEAR A RADIO ANNOUNCER.

                              ANNOUNCER
               Commodity prices rose sharply today
               in unusually heavy trading...

119  EXT. RESTAURANT                                             119

     A French restaurant on the Gold Coast.  It's noon.

120  INT. RESTAURANT                                             120

     Ferris, Sloane and Cameron are standing in the restaurant.
     Ferris is looking at the maitre 'd's reservations book.

     HIS POV

     His fingers runs down to a party of three for 12:00.

     INT. RESTAURANT

     The maitre'd returns.

                              MAITRE'D
                          (to Ferris)
               May I help you?

                              FERRIS
               Yes. I'm Abe Frohman. Party of
               three for 12:00.

     The maitre'd looks at Ferris curiously.

                              FERRIS
               Is there a problem?

                              MAITRE'D
               You're Abe Frohman?

                              FERRIS
               I'm Abe Frohman.

                              MAITRE'D
                          (chuckles)
               I'm sorry, son. I'm very busy right
               now. If you have trouble finding the
               door...

     Sloane tugs Ferris' sleeve. He ignores her.

                              FERRIS
               Are you suggesting that I'm not
               who I say I am?

                              MAITRE'D
               Shall I call the police?

                              CAMERON
               Let's go...Abe.

                              FERRIS
               I'm not going anywhere.
                          (to the Maitre'd)
               Call the police. Go ahead. Better
               yet...
                          (grabs the phone)
               ...I'll call myself.

     Cameron chokes. Sloane grits her teeth. The maitre'd smiles
     smuggly.

     CU. PHONE

     Ferris punches out a number. A beat and the restaurant's
     second line lights up and the phone rings.

     INT. RESTAURANT

     The maitre'd motions for the phone so that he can answer the
     call. Ferris waves him off angrily.

                              FERRIS
               You touch me and I yell "rat!"
               There's another phone around here.
               Find it.

     The maitre'd backs off.

                              CAMERON
               Ferris, let's split, please?

                              SLOANE
               Cameron's right. We're gonna
               get busted.

                              FERRIS
               Not a chance in the world.

     He hands the phone to Sloane.

                              FERRIS
               Ask for Abe Frohman.

     INT. RESTAURANT. LATER

     Ferris, Sloane and Cameron are seated in the restaurant. The
     maitre'd is hovering over Ferris.

                              MAITRE'D
               I appreciate your understanding.

                              FERRIS
               Don't grovel, Charles. Just leave
               us to our repast and all will be
               forgotten.

                              MAITRE'D
               Enjoy your luncheon.

                              FERRIS
               Thank you.

     The maitre'd backs away. Ferris smiles. Sloane is impressed.
     Cameron is flushed with nerves.

                              FERRIS
               Darling, you were wonderful.

                              SLOANE
               Oh, but I had a wonderful teacher.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, dear friend?

     Cameron looks to Ferris.

                              FERRIS
               And you thought we wouldn't have
               any fun. Shame on you.

     Ferris disappears behind his menu.

121  EXT. SCHOOL                                                 121

     We HEAR HALLWAY SOUNDS AND JEANIE.

                              JEANIE (VO)
               Ferris Bueller's days are numbered.

122  INT. GIRL'S LOCKER ROOM                                     122

     Jeanie's sitting on a bench in a field hockey uniform. She's
     talking to a FRIEND.

                              JEANIE
                          (mean, vicious)
               I'm gonna bust his buns.

                              FRIEND
               Why? What's the point?

                              JEANIE
               Why? Because I'm sick of the little
               dope. He manipulates my parents, he
               does whatever he wants, whenever he
               wants and he never gets nailed.
                          (wicked pause)
               Well, babe, today I'm the hammer.

     She yanks angrily on the velcro strap on her sneakers. The
     straps rip off in her hand.

                              FRIEND
               I think he's cute.

                              JEANIE
               Sweetie, it's an established fact that
               you have no taste. Ferris is not cute.
               He's not charming. He's not nice. He's
               not a wonderful person. He's an ignorant
               mule and the sooner everybody in this
               school comes to that realization the
               better off we'll all be.

     She displays the velcro straps to her friend.

                              JEANIE
               See? My brother strokes you, you
               sympathize with him, I get pissed
               off and this is what happens!

     Jeanie tosses the straps on the floor.

                              JEANIE
               Let me tell you something. I study
               hard, I work hard, I'm polite, I'm
               considerate, I'm friendly and fair
               to all kinds of people. Except
               morons. I try to be everything a
               good, decent person should be and
               you know what?

                              FRIEND
               Everybody thinks you're an asshole.

     Jeanie freezes with her next sentence pinned to her tongue.

                              JEANIE
               Excuse me?

                              FRIEND
               I don't think you're an asshole.

                              JEANIE
               Who does?

     Her friend smiles sheepishly.

                              JEANIE
               Rachel?

     Jeanie's friend shrugs, wags her head, does everything but
     verbally confirm.

                              JEANIE
               Rachel's a dirt bag. Who else?

                              FRIEND
               I don't know. Just forget it.

                              JEANIE
               Forget that everybody thinks I'm an
               asshole? Would you like everybody to
               think you're an asshole?

                              FRIEND
               Not everybody thinks you're an
               asshole. Mr. Rooney likes you.

                              JEANIE
               Oh, hey. That's exciting. A fat
               fifty year old clod with B.O.
               likes me.

     Jeanie shakes her head in disbelief.

                              JEANIE
               Would everybody be happier if
               maybe I were to die in a flaming
               car accident or something?

                              FRIEND
               Maybe if you didn't cat like and
               asshole...

                              JEANIE
               Am I acting like an asshole?

                              FRIEND
               I didn't mean it that way.

                              JEANIE
               I this a conspiracy to shit all
               over me or something? Is my brother
               behind this? Tell me if he is or I'll
               sock your tits.

                              FRIEND
               You really do have a problem, Jeanie.

                              JEANIE
               Me? I have a problem?

                              FRIEND
               Somebody who threatens to sock people's
               tits has a problem.

                              JEANIE
               Alright. How about if I sock your
               face?

     Jeanie's friend gets up.

                              FRIEND
               Take a walk, Jeanie.

     Her friend exits.

                              JEANIE
                          (yells after her)
               If it means anything to you, I
               have my period! MY BODY'S RIDDING
               ITSELF OF OLD EGGS, GODDAMN IT!

     She snarls and slumps against the lockers.

                              JEANIE
               He's gone. He's over. He's monkey meat.

123  INT. MEN'S ROOM. CHEZ PAUL                                  123

     Ferris is standing at the urinal.

                              FERRIS
               She's a person who views life as
               an ordeal that must be endured. Her
               body is a transport vehicle for her
               anger. I don't know where she gets
               this shit. Basically, the family's
               pretty cool.

     He looks down at the urinal.

                              FERRIS
               I wonder if everybody shoots at
               cigarette butts in urinals? Probably
               not many women.
                          (continues)
               I used to think that my family was
               the only one that had weirdness
               in it. It used to worry me. Then I
               met Cameron and I saw how his
               family functioned.

     He zips this trousers and steps away from the urinal.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron's home life is really shit.
               He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick
               all the time. It really upsets him.
               What he said about his parents hating
               each other? I refuse to sleep over at
               his house. His parents fight all the
               time. Even when I'm there. Is there
               anything worse than being at somebody's
               house when their parents are fighting?
               It's the absolute height of social
               discomfort.

     He checks his hair in the mirror.

                              FERRIS
               When they go after each other, Cameron
               tightens up. It's scary. He gets so
               wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns
               apart with a crowbar. The thing with
               taking his old man's car? It's good
               for him. It teaches him to deal with
               his fear. Plus, and I must
               be honest here, I love driving it.
               I highly recommend picking one up.

     He exists the men's room. We hold a beat. A toilet flushes.
     Another beat and Tom walks out of the stall. He crosses to
     the sink.

124  INT. RESTAURANT                                             124

     Cameron and Sloane have been served their lunches. They're
     staring at the plates.

                              CAMERON
               What is it?

                              SLOANE
               I don't know. But it looks like
               it's already been eaten and digested.

                              CAMERON
               I knew it was a mistake letting
               Ferris order for us.

     Ferris slides over to the table and drops into his seat.

                              FERRIS
               What are you doing?

     Cameron looks at Ferris.

                              CAMERON
               What is this shit?

                              FERRIS
               You got me. I don't speak French.

     He puts his napkin in his lap and smells his plate.

                              FERRIS
               I think it's a land-based beefoid
               creature.

     He takes a bite. He savors the taste.

                              FERRIS
               Splendid.

                              CAMERON
               Really?

                              FERRIS
               Superb.

     Cameron and Sloane try theirs. They chew tentatively.

                              FERRIS
               Good?

     Sloane and Cameron shrug. It's not bad. A WAITER passes.
     Ferris stops him.

                              FERRIS
               Yo, Clouseau!

     The waiter stops and looks at Ferris indignantly.

                              FERRIS
               I have a growth on my brain that
               causes memory lapses. Could you
               tell me what we ordered here?

     The waiter glances at the plates.

                              WAITER
               Sweetbreads.

                              FERRIS
               Uh, huh. And what might that be?

                              WAITER
               Pancreas.

                              FERRIS
               As in the gland that has important
               functions in digestion and metabolism?

     CU. SLOANE AND CAMERON

     They stop chewing. They're holding their sweetbreads in their
     mouths.

     CU. FERRIS

     He continues his questioning.

                              FERRIS
               ...That secretes a thick, colorless fluid
               containing digestive enzymes? The home
               of the world famous isles of Langerhans?

     CU. WAITER

     He nods broadly, knowing that he's spoiling the kids' meal.

     CU. SLOANE AND CAMERON

     They look at each other.

     CU. FERRIS

     He pats his mouth with his napkin. He looks to Cameron and
     Sloane. He raises a finger, holds it a beat and gives a cue.

     CU. WAITER

     He turns away as Sloane and Cameron spit out their food.

     CU. FERRIS

     He watches Sloane and Cameron then glances at the waiter.

                              FERRIS
               Check, please!

125  EXT. RESTAURANT                                             125

     Tom and his two GUESTS are standing at the curb, talking. A
     cab is waiting. The door's open. In the B.G. Ferris, Sloane
     and Cameron come out of the restaurant. They approach the
     cab. Tom's back it to Ferris. Ferris stops cold.

     FERRIS, SLOANE, CAMERON

     They turns on cue at Tom, now in the B.G., turns toward the
     restaurant.

                              FERRIS
               40,000 restaurants in the downtown
               area and I pick the one my father
               goes to.

                              CAMERON
               We're gonna get nabbed, for sure.

                              FERRIS
               No way, Cameron. Only the meek
               get nabbed. The bold survive.
               Let's go.

     He turns to the cab. Sloane and Cameron turn slowly.

     EXT. STREET. CAB

     Tom and his party are still jawing at curbside. Ferris,
     Sloane and Cameron slowly approach the cab. Behind the backs
     of the men, Ferris scoots Sloane into the cab. Cameron
     dashes in. The Ferris hops the cab.

     INT. CAB

     Ferris slams the door.

     CU. CAB DOOR HANDLE

     A man's hand reaches for the handle as the cab pulls away.

     EXT. RESTAURANT

     Tom and his guests watch in bewilderment at their cab takes
     off. MUSIC COMES UP.

126  EXT. MUSEUM OR SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY                         126

     The grand old Chicago museum.

127  INT. MUSEUM. OVERHEAD SHOT                                  127

     The main gallery is crowded with school kids.

     INT. MUSEUM. FLOOR

     A class of kids walking along holding hands. Among the
     second graders are Ferris, Sloane and Cameron, holding hands
     looking like giant grade schoolers.

     INT. MUSEUM. DISPLAY CASE

     Baby chicks are hatching in a huge, round incubator. Sloane,
     Ferris and Cameron are intently watching the process.

     INT. MUSEUM. COAL MINE

     Sloane, Ferris and Cameron ride in the coal train in the
     coal mine replica. Ferris and Sloane are making out.

     INT. MUSEUM. INDUSTRIAL DISPLAY

     Sloane operates a metal press to produce a tin ashtray.

     INT. MUSEUM. HEART REPLICA

     A giant, walk-thru replica of a human heart. Ferris staggers
     out of it, clutching his heart, feigning a massive heart
     attack.

     INT. GERMAN U-BOAT

     Ferris is examining the controls of the captured U-Boat. He
     checks to see if he's being watched then he presses a button
     and pulls a lever.

     CU. PROPELLER

     For the first time in forty years, the screw turns.

     CU. HUMAN FETUS IN A BOTTLE

     The famous stages of life display which features bottled
     fetuses. The ninth month. A tiny human being in a jar.

     CU. SLOANE, FERRIS, CAMERON

     Sloane wants to cry. Cameron's stomach is in his throat.
     Ferris is lost in thought. The MUSIC ENDS.

                              SLOANE
                          (remorsefully)
               I wonder if he has a name?

                              FERRIS
                          (blank)
               Ninth Month.

128  EXT. CHICAGO RIVER. LONG, HIGH SHOT                        128

     From the Merchandise Mart, looking down the fetid, green
     swath of water. A boat is rolling up the man-made canyon.

                              CAMERON (VO)
               Are you guys worried about nuclear war?

                              FERRIS (VO)
               Cameron, it's a beautiful day, we've
               won our freedom, we're traveling down
               one of American's most scenic polluted
               waterways and you have to bring up
               nuclear war?

                              SLOANE (VO)
               It is kind of raggy subject, Cam.

                              CAMERON (VO)
               Regardless. It's with us every day.
               The possiblity of global destruction.

                              SLOANE (VO)
               Don't you think it's an issue because
               people need something to worry about?
               They have to like, have some major
               problem that puts all their little
               bullshit into some kind of persepective?

                              CAMERON (VO)
               Maybe.

                              FERRIS
               They used to have Viet Nam. They
               used to have the oil crisis stuff
               and Iran. That's over and people
               have to have their big issue. It's
               not like somebody came up with the
               nuclear holocaust yesterday at
               noon, you know.

                              SLOANE (VO)
               To answer your question...No, I'm not
               worried about it at all.

                              FERRIS (VO)
               We don't know when the bombs going
               off. We do know, however, that college
               starts in the fall.

                              CAMERON (VO)
                          (dramatic, deadly serious)
               Do you know what a nuclear winter is?

     Long beat.

                              SLOANE (VO)
               Yeah. Everybody's dead, it's real
               cold and the skiing's for shit.

     The boat makes the turn in the river and CLEARS FRAME.

     EXT. BOAT DOCK

     The three are sitting on the aft deck of the tour boat.
     Their feet are up on the railing. Very casual, very relaxed.
     Discussing the end of the world.

                              SLOANE
               My step-father's always going off about
               how when he was young he was committed to
               all these causes.

                              FERRIS
               He's full of shit. All the old hippies
               are full of shit.

                              SLOANE
               He says I don't care about things like
               he did.

                              FERRIS
               What's he care about now?

                              SLOANE
               Baldness, fatty meats and money.

                              FERRIS
               I rest my case.

                              CAMERON
               What's spooky is they still control
               everything. They took over when they
               were young and they never gave it up.

                              FERRIS
               One of the most frightening experiences
               of my young life has been observing
               my parents and our neighbors playing
               the Baby Boom Edition of Trivial Pursuits.
               It's chilling to see people crazed with
               the minutia of their past.

                              CAMERON
               It's human nature to like what you had
               better than what you have.

                              SLOANE
               Agreed.

     A loud speaker on the boat identifies a point of interest.

                              LOUDSPEAKER
               TO YOUR LEFT IT THE WORLD'S TALLEST
               BUILDING...

     The three look to the left.

                              LOUDSPEAKER, FERRIS,
                              SLOANE, CAMERON
               The Sears Tower.

                              CAMERON
               You know, this is all very interesting
               but I'm starving.

                              FERRIS
               An hour ago you wanted to yack.

                              CAMERON
               I feel better now.

                              FERRIS
               Lean over and grab a fish.

     Cameron looks over the side of the boat. An obtuse thought
     flashes through Sloane's brain.

                              SLOANE
               What comes after a nuclear winter?

                              FERRIS
               Nuclear spring.

129  EXT. SCHOOL                                                 129

     Meanwhile...

130  INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DEAN'S OFFICE                      130

     Jeanie is having a small moral debate with herself.

                              JEANIE
               It's reprehensible to squeal on
               your own flesh and blood...but it's
               for his own good. His cavalier
               attitude will get him into trouble
               later in life...and it'll continue
               to piss me off and I'll get so
               wadded-up that it'll cause cervex cancer
               and he'll ruin my life. Screw him.

     She slips into the Dean's outer office.

131  INT. DEAN'S OUTER OFFICE                                    131

     Rooney's secretary is behind her desk. Jeanie walks in. The
     secretary looks up and greets her with a weary smile.

                              SECRETARY
               Hello, Jeanie. Who's bothering
               you now?

     Jeanie scowls at her.

                              JEANIE
               Is Dean Rooney in?

                              SECRETARY
               I'm sorry, he's out. Can I help you?

                              JEANIE
                          (condescending)
               I seriously doubt it. When's he back?

                              SECRETARY
               I don't know. He left the grounds
               on personal business.

132  EXT. STREET. CU. CURB                                       132

     A car tire rolls into FRAME and stops. Slide across to the
     sidewalk. Rooney's dress shoe steps out onto the pavement.
     Move up to reveal Rooney standing at the door of his
     bile-green LeBaron. Rooney peels off his shades and looks
     around like he's Dirty Harry. In his mind he is Dirty Harry.

     CU. FIRE HYDRANT

     Rooney's dres shoe on the hydrant. He ties his lace and
     pulls up his sock.

     EXT. STREET

     Rooney straightens his tie and jacket and slips into a rowdy
     hot dog joint.

133  INT. HOT DOG STAND                                          133

     It's jammed with construction workers, secretaries, suburban
     businessmen. It's loud and confusing. Rooney pushes his way
     in and scopes the crowd.

     HIS POV

     A young person is playing a video game in a far corner.

     CU. ROONEY

     He suspects it's Ferris. It look sort of like Ferris. He
     smiles and cuts into the crowd.

     CU. THE BACK OF THE VIDEO PLAYER'S HEAD

     MOVE IN on the player.

                              ROONEY (OC)
               I've been waiting a long time
               for this.

     The player looks up.

                              ROONEY (OC)
               Your ass is mine.

     The player turns around. It's a GIRL.

     CU. ROONEY

     The blood evacuates his face. He stares at the girl.

     CU. GIRL

     She stares at him. She picks up her Coke. She puts the straw
     to her lips and sucks.

     CU. ROONEY

     He's still staring. He can't think of anything to say.

     CU. GIRL

     Holding the straw in the mouth, she draws it out of the cup.
     She raises it, pointing it directly in Rooney's face.

     CU. ROONEY

     He squints

     CU. GIRL

     She blows a strawful of Coke in Rooney's face.

     CU. NAPKIN HOLDER

     A hand yanks a napkin hold.

     INT. HOT DOG STAND. SERVICE COUNTER

     Rooney wipes his face. Behind him is the kitchen and a
     grease-covered TV set broadcasting a Cubs baseball game.
     There's a long foul ball. The TV camera follows the ball
     into the stands. A kid makes a stab at the ball. Rooney
     wipes his suit off. The TV camera zooms in on the boy
     triumphantly holding the foul ball aloft. It's Ferris.
     He does a little celebration dance. Rooney wads up the
     napkin and tosses it in a trashbin. The TV camera returns to
     the game. Rooney glances at the screen.

                              ROONEY
               What's the score?

                              HOT DOG MAN
               Zero to zero.

                              ROONEY
               Who's winning?

                              HOT DOG MAN
               Cubs.

     Rooney nods and exits.

134  EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD. STANDS                                  134

     Ferris sits down with the baseball. He shakes his stinging
     paw. On either side of him are Cameron and Sloane. Cameron's
     scarfing nachos.

                              FERRIS
               I think I broke my thumb.

                              SLOANE
               Can we leave now?

                              FERRIS
               You want to leave? We just got here.

                              SLOANE
               You got a call, you broke your thumb,
               what's left to do?

     Cameron offers his nachos to Sloane. She looks at them with
     disgust.

                              SLOANE
               No wonder you're always sick.

     Ferris leans back, puts his hands behind his head and turns
     his face to the bright sun.

                              FERRIS
               Do you realize that if I played by
               the rules, right now I'd be in gym?

135  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. PLAYING FIELD                             135

     A boy's gym class is doing laps. A blue Fiat pulls into the
     shot.

136  INT. FIAT                                                   136

     Jeanie's at the wheel. She sneaks a glance at the school.

                              JEANIE
               I can't believe my brother's making
               me put myself in a position where I
               could get expelled. Selfish little
               moron.
                          (pause)
               Ferris? You're overshadowed
               me long enough. I'm gonna get
               you, buddy.

     She puts the car in gear and drives out of the shot.

137  EXT. STATE STREET                                           137

     A parade is underway. Floats and politicians. Marching
     bands, drum and bugle corps, soldiers, school kids. Figure
     skating club in outfits and skates performing their routines
     on pavement. It's GERMAN-AMERICAN APPRECIATION DAY.

     EXT. STATE STREET. FLOAT

     Riding atop on a float is Ferris. He's waving to the crowd.
     He and half a dozen homely German-American Beauty Queens.
     He's leading the girls in singing, "DANKE SHOEN".

     EXT. STATE STREET. SLOANE AND CAMERON

     They're watching Ferris go by. They wave to him.

                              SLOANE
               I love him.

                              CAMERON
               It's hard not to.

     Cameron breaks a smile. As worried as he is about the day
     and getting caught, he has to admire Ferris for his lack of
     inhabitions. Cameron mumbles a few words.

                              CAMERON
               Stop...water...want...

                              SLOANE
               Do you believe in reincarnation?

                              CAMERON
               Huh?

                              SLOANE
               Do you believe that you lived before?

                              CAMERON
               Yeah. Sort of.

                              SLOANE
               DO you ever wonder what you were?

                              CAMERON
               I don't have to wonder. I know.

     Sloane looks at him with amazement.

                              CAMERON
               I was a tractor tire.

     EXT. STATE STREET. FLOAT

     Ferris is on his knees, reaching down from the float,
     shaking hands with people in the crowd.

                              FERRIS
               Guten tag, dude!

     EXT. STATE STREET

     Sloane and Cameron continue their conversation.

                              CAMERON
               What were you in a previous life?

                              SLOANE
               I'm not sure but I think I know
               who Ferris was.

                              CAMERON
               Hannibal.

                              SLOANE
               From the A-Team?

                              CAMERON
               No. The guy who rode the elephants
               into Switzerland.

     Sloane laughs at herself. They step out of the crowd and
     head down the street in the direction the parade's heading.

                              SLOANE
               I think if he was anybody, he
               was Magellan. You know, the guy
               who went around the world.

     Cameron nods.

                              SLOANE
               I could see him ignoring popular
               belief and taking off on some
               impossible mission.

                              CAMERON
               Yeah. As long as I've known him,
               everything works for him. There's
               nothing he can't handle. I can't
               handle anything. School, parents,
               the future. Ferris can do anything.

     EXT. STATE STREET. FLOAT

     Ferris is playing "TWIST AND SHOUT" on the accordian. The
     girls on the float are singing.

                              FERRIS
               WELL, SHAKE IT UP, BABY, NOW!

                              GIRLS
               SHAKE IT UP, BABY

                              FERRIS
               TWIST AND SHOUT!

                              GIRLS
               TWIST AND SHOUT!

                              FERRIS
               COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, BABY ON!
               COME ON AND WORK IT ON OUT!

                              GIRLS
               WORK IT ON OUT!

     EXT. STREET. SLOANE AND CAMERON

     They continue their conversation.

                              SLOANE
               The future's worse for a boy, isn't
               it?

     Cameron doesn't understand what she means.

                              SLOANE
               A girl can always bail out and
               have a baby and get some guy
               to support her.

                              CAMERON
               That's a pretty grim thought.

                              SLOANE
               True, but it's an option. No options
               is worse.

                              CAMERON
               I don't know what I'm gonna do.

                              SLOANE
               College.

                              CAMERON
               Yeah, but to do what?

                              SLOANE
               What are you interested in?

                              CAMERON
               Nothing.

                              SLOANE
               Me either.

     They walk on for a few beats. We HEAR "TWIST AND SHOUT"
     GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER. The sons is taking over all the
     other tunes in the band. It's infecting the entire parade.

                              CAMERON
               What do you think Ferris is gonna
               do?

     EXT. STATE STREET. MARCHING BAND

     They're playing TWIST AND SHOUT.

     EXT. STREET. CHOIR GROUP

     They're marching down the parade. They're singing in their
     angleic voices.

                              CHOIR
               AND LET ME KNOW THAT YOU'RE MINE!

     EXT. STREET. STREET CLEANERS

     The POLITICIANS and their WIVES stand up.

                              PARADE
               AHHHHH!

     The SOUND OF THE VOICES blends with the SOUND OF A RED-LINED
     HIGH PERFORMANCE ENGINE.

138  EXT. CALUMET CITY                                           138

     The Port of Chicago. Grim, gritty waterfront. Suddenly,
     Cameron's father's car flies OVER CAMERA. Like the opening
     shot in Star Wars. The Starship Ferrari. SLO-MO.

     CU. FERRARI UNDER-CARRIAGE

     It travels past to reveal a beautiful blue sky. SLO-MO.

     CU. PARKING ATTENDANT

     His eyes are wide with exhilaration. Mouth open, tongue out.
     Maniac at the wheel. SLO-MO.

     CU. RASTAMAN

     His eyes are closed. Big smile. SLO-MO,

     EXT. STREETS. KIDS

     They're looking up in the air, following the car as it flies
     over them. Broad, excited smiles. The car's shadow passes
     over them. SLO-MO.

139  CU. CAR GRILLE                                              139

     It fills the frame and stops. We MOVE UP to reveal Rooney
     behind the wheel of his car.

     EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE

     Rooney gets out of his car. He looks at the house, looks up
     and down the street, then crosses to Ferris' house.

140  INT. HOUSE. FOYER                                           140

     Rooney's at the front door. We see him peek in a window at
     the top of the door. The doorbell rings.

141  INT. HOUSE. FERRIS' ROOM. COMPUTER                          141

     It acknowledges the doorbell.

     CU. CASSETTE PLAYER

     It clicks on.

142  EXT. HOUSE. FRONT PORCH                                     142

     The house intercom activates. We HEAR FERRIS' VOICE.

                              FERRIS
               Who is it?

     Rooney presses the intercom.

                              ROONEY
               This is Ed Rooney, Ferris. I'd
               like to have a word with you.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'm sorry I can't come to the door
               right now. I'm very ill and I'm
               afraid that in my weakened condition,
               I could take a nasty spill down the
               stairs and subject myself to further
               school absenses.

     There's a pause. Rooney presses the intercom again.

                              ROONEY
               B.S. Come down here.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               You can reach my parents at their
               places of business. Thank you for
               stopping by. I appreciate your concern
               for my well-being. It will be remembered
               long after this illness has past.

     His voice clicks off. Rooney presses the intercom again.

                              ROONEY
               I'm not leaving until you come
               down and talk to me.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Have a nice day.

     Rooney presses the intercom.

                              ROONEY
               I'm not leaving, Ferris.

     There's no response. Rooney rings the doorbell again. The
     pre-recorded litany starts over.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Who is it?

     Rooney doesn't realize that he's listening to a recording.

                              ROONEY
               Don't get smart with me Ferris!

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'm sorry I can't come to the door
               right now. I'm very ill and I'm
               afraid that in my weakened condition...

     Rooney leans back from the door. He can't quite figure out
     what's going on. But's it's highly suspicious.

143  INT. HOUSE. LIVING ROOM                                     143

     Rooney steps through the hedges and peeks in the windows. We
     HEAR FERRIS' VOICE inside.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               You may reach my parents at their
               places of business.

144  INT. HOUSE. KITCHEN                                         144

     Rooney tries to peak in the kitchen window.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I appreciate your conern for my
               well-being. It will be remembered
               long after...

145  EXT. HOUSE. BACKDOOR                                        145

     A black rubber doggie door. The type that allows a dog to
     come and go as it pleases. Rooney is crouched down. He lifts
     the doggie door and peeks in the house.

     HIS POV

     Along the kitchen floor. Through the kitchen, into the
     dining room. We hear a LARGE DOG GROWL.

     CU. ROONEY

     He's peaking through the door. He hears the dog. His face
     freezes.

                              FERRIS
               Have a nice day.

     EXT. HOUSE. DOGGIE DOOR

     A Rottweiler bursts through the doggie door in a fury of
     gnashing teeth and foam.

146  CU. LARGE BREASTS                                           146

     Tassled pasties twirl like airplane propellers.

     CU. CAMERON, FERRIS AND SLOANE

     They're sitting in a booth in the garish, nearly deserted
     strip joint. Cameron's mouth is open in amazement. Sloane is
     embarrassed and revolted.

                              CAMERON
               How does she do that? One goes
               one way, one goes the other.

                              FERRIS
               She's probably schizophrenic.

                              SLOANE
               Ferris, this is nauseating me.
               Really. I'm losing respect for
               you by the bucket.

                              FERRIS
               You don't think it's amazing that
               we got in?

                              SLOANE
               Who wants to get in?

                              FERRIS
               Cameron looks like a toddler, for
               Christ's sake. I'm talking about
               a major achievement in false
               identification.

                              SLOANE
               I'm not interested in watching
               someone jiggle their mammary glands.

                              FERRIS
               Point well taken. But consider why
               she does it. Why she does it and
               you don't.

                              SLOANE
               I'm not a tramp.

                              FERRIS
               Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she
               lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend.
               A parent. A child...
                          (to CAMERA)
               This kind of thing makes me a little
               depressed. You may think because I'm
               the age I am that I'm a sex maniac.
               That sex is all I think about.
               But that's not true. I'm a romantic.
               I think alot of people my age are.
               We think about love and matters of
               the heart. And SAT scores and acne
               aside, we worry about lonliness. It's
               a terrible thing. And we feel it. I
               feel it.

     He flips his collar up, curls his lip and affects an Elvis
     impression. A sappy, do-wop track FADES UP. The club lights
     go down. Cameron and Sloane disappear into darkness. Ferris
     stands up from the booth. He strolls slowly through the
     empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of
     blue light.

                              FERRIS
               You know, someone said the world's a
               stage and each must play a part.
               Fate had me playing in love, with you
               as my sweetheart. Act one was when we
               met. I loved you at first glance. You
               read your lines so cleverly and never
               missed a cue. Then came act two. You
               seemed to change. You acted strange.
               And why, I've never known.

     He climbs up on the little runway. The stripper disappears
     in darkness as Ferris takes over the spotlight.

                              FERRIS
               Honey, you lies when you said you
               loved me and I had no cause to
               doubt you. But I'd rather go on
               hearing your lies than to go on
               living without you. Now, the stage
               is bare and I'm standing there with
               emptiness all around and if you won't
               come back to me, then they can bring
               the curtain down...

     Elvis fades up. The orignal recording. Ferris lip synchs
     with the big, dramatic florish that was the King's trademark
     ballad sign-off.

                              ELVIS
               IS YOUR HEART FILLED WITH PAIN?
               SHALL I COME BACK AGAIN?
               TELL ME DEAR, ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT?

     Ferris drops his head. Like the King would.

147  EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET. CAMERON'S CAR                         147

     Cameron's father is looking at the car. He's studying it. It
     looks terribly familiar. He leans into the open car and
     reaches for the glovebox to see if the contents will confirm
     if it's his. He freezes. He looks up slowly.

     HIS POV

     The Attendant and the Rastaman are glowering at him. They're
     holding bags of fried chicken.

                              ATTENDANT
               You looking for something in my
               car?

     CU. CAMERON'S FATHER

     He shakes his head, no.

                              CAMERON'S FATHER
               No.

148  EXT. FERRIS' TOWN. JEANIE                                   148

     Jeanie's standing at her car. She's staring incredulously
     into the distance. Her mouth's open. She's shaking her head
     slowly.

     HER POV

     Spray-painted on the town water tower in gigantic black
     letters -- SAVE FERRIS BUELLER.

     CU. JEANIE

     She's furious.

                              JEANIE
               I'm gonna microwave his nuts...

149  EXT. MICHIGAN AVENUE                                        149

     Afternoon traffic.

150  INT. TAXI CAB                                               150

     Ferris, Sloane and Cameron in the backseat of a checker.
     Ferris is on one window, Cameron on the other. Sloane's in
     the middle. Ferris is talking to the DRIVER.

                              FERRIS
               So...

     He leans forward and reads the driver's name off the city
     license.

                              FERRIS
               So, Yuri, how long have you been
               in America?

                              DRIVER
               One year.

                              FERRIS
               What's your overall impression?

                              DRIVER
               It's very good here.

                              FERRIS
               Better than Russia?

                              DRIVER
               Much better here than in Russia.

                              FERRIS
               Clearly you've never been to an
               American high school.

     Ferris sits back. He puts his arm around Sloane.

                              CAMERON
               It's getting late, Ferris. I have
               to get the car home. I know you
               don't care, but it means my ass.

                              FERRIS
               You think I don't care?

                              CAMERON
               I know you don't care.

                              FERRIS
               That hurts, Cameron.

                              SLOANE
               Jump back, Ferris, Cameron's been
               a good sport.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, what'd you see today?

     Cameron looks at him.

                              FERRIS
               You saw four states, a submarine,
               a giant heart, seventy five dollars
               worth of cooked pancreas, two of the
               most incredible breasts ever to come
               out of modern plastics, major
               league baseball and...
                          (quizical look)
               Are you gonna chuck your nachos?

     Cameron's staring past Ferris. He's frozen. Ferris realizes
     he's looking at something out the window. He turns. He
     freezes.

     HIS POV

     In the gridlock traffic, their cab is squeezed tight
     alongside another cab. In that cab is Tom. He's about a foot
     from Ferris. He turns and looks right into CAMERA.

     TOM'S POV

     Ferris' frozen face.

     FERRIS' POV

     Tom glances back at his paper. He pauses. Looks up. Thinks.
     Turns back to CAMERA.

     TOM'S POV

     Sloane is sitting where Ferris was. She's wearing
     sunglasses, looking bored. She turns and glances out the
     window. Fakes a yawn.

     HER POV

     Tom stares at her. He's baffled. He looks away.

     INT. CAB. FLOOR.

     Cameron and Ferris are on the floor. On their asses, with
     their backs to the back of the front seat, feet up on the
     seat.

                              FERRIS
                          (to Sloane)
               What's he doing?

                              SLOANE
                          (revolted)
               He's looking at me and he's licking
               the glass and making obscene gestures
               with his hands.

                              FERRIS
               What?!

     Sloane bursts out laughing.

                              SLOANE
               Roast!

     She licks her finger and touches Ferris knee. She makes a
     sizzling sound. She collapes on the seat in hysterics.

     INT. TOM'S CAB

     Tom's looking into Ferris' cab.

     HIS POV

     Sloane's bouncing up and down.

     CU. TOM

     He can't quite figure out what's going on. He turns and
     slowly raises his newspaper over his face. We see on the
     back of the paper a small story with the headline: COMMUNITY
     RALLIES AROUND SICK YOUTH.

151  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE. BACKYARD. DOG                           151

     The Rottweiler's chewing on a shoe. Tearing it apart.

     EXT. BACKYARD. ROONEY

     He's standing outside the fence. He's missing a shoe. His
     suit pants are torn from the crotch to the knee. His suit
     coat pocket is torn off. His hair's messed and there're
     grass-stains on his knees and elbows. He's looking in at the
     dog.

                              ROONEY
               That's a $28.00 dress shoe, you
               worthless mutt!

     HIS POV

     The Rottweiler leaps at CAMERA.

152  EXT. CITY STREET                                            152

     Ferris is leading the way down Michigan Avenue. He's
     hustling through the crowd. He has Sloane by the hand. She's
     jogging to keep up. Cameron's a few steps behind. He keeps
     bumping into people. Ferris and Sloane make the turn at
     Wacker Driver and disappear into the Stone Container
     Building. Cameron follows, mumbling again.

                              CAMERON
               Money...tits...please...

153  EXT. HOUSE. FRONT                                           153

     A florist truck pulls up in front of the house. A DELIVERY
     MAN gets out iwth a huge floral arrangement. He heads up to
     the house.

154  EXT. HOUSE. PORCH                                           154

     Rooney's sitting on the porch patting a bloody knee with his
     handkerchief. The delivery man hops up on the steps. Rooney
     looks up at him. He greets Rooney cheerily.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               Howdy!

     He presses the doorbell. A beat and we hear Ferris'
     recording.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Who is it?

     The Deliver Man presses the intercom.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               Focus on Flowers. I have a delivery.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'm sorry but I can't come to the
               door right now. I'm very ill and I'm
               afraid...

               ROONEY                              FERRIS' VOICE
     It's a recording, asshole.        ...that in my weakened
                                       condition, I could take a

               ROONEY                        (pause)
     He's one of my students.          You can reach my parents

                                       this illness has passed.

                          DELIVERY MAN
               As I heard it from our mailman
               he was supposedly born with only
               half a kidney.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               Have a nice day.

                              DELIVERY MAN
                          (to the intercom)
               Thank you.
                          (continues)
               I don't know the details. But my
               boss had to send to Milwaukee to
               get more orchids. He's very
               popular.

     Rooney is flabbergasted.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               Nobody's home here?

                              ROONEY
               No.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               You gonna be around for awhile?

                              ROONEY
               I imagine so.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               You wanna keep an eye on these?

     Rooney looks at the flowers. Then he looks at the Delivery
     Man.

                              DELIVERY MAN
                          (happy sigh)
               It really touches me that so many people
               are rallying behind this guy. I guess
               there's hope for the human race afterall.

     He hands the arrangement to Rooney.

                              DELIVERY MAN
               Gotta run.

     He bounds off the porch and trots to the truck. Rooney looks
     incredulously at the arrangement. He opens the attached
     card.

                              ROONEY
                          (defeated)
               Oh, Christ...

     CU. CARD

     It's signed:

     The number one afternoon FM rock'n roll D.J. is sitting
     behind his microphone.

                              D.J.
               I don't know who that was or
               what they were playing but I
               apologize for it nonetheless.

157  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE                                          157

     Jeanie's car pull in the driveway. We hear her car radio.

                              D.J.
               His name is Ferris Mueller.

                              FERRIS
               Bueller. Ferris Bueller.

     INT. CAR. JEANIE

     She goes into shock. Her eyes blink, her head cocks.

                              D.J.
               Sorry about that.

                              FERRIS
               It's cool.

     Jeanie draws back and punches out her radio.

     CU. CAR ANTENNA

     The impact of her blow to the radio shoots the antenna in
     the air.

     Ferris leans forward and adjusts the microphone.

                              D.J.
               He has an incredible story.

     Ferris turns to CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
               I'm going to tell a massive lie here.
               It's going to by very thick and very
               steamy. I think radio's a facinating
               medium, it challenges the imagination.
               Unlike television which provides the
               images, radio...
                          (pause)
               You know this. Anyway, it's always been
               a dream of mine to be on the radio.
               I have what I consider to be an excellent
               broadcast voice. I practise it in the
               bathroom all the time. I used to play
               records and do introductions to them.
               But I've never had the chance to sit
               behind a microphone and try it out
               for real. This is a 50,000 watt outlet.
               I'm going out to several million people
               so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant
               groove right now.
                          (clears his voice,
                           speaks into the
                           mike, affects a
                           "radio" voice)
               Well, Steve, you and your listeners are
               probably not going to believe this but...

159  INT. SCHOOL                                                 159

     A group of kids are sitting around a blaster.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               ...I'm the first Chicago area youth
               to be selected to participate in
               a space shuttle mission.

     Ferris turns from the mike to CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
               I was going to say I knew Springsteen's
               home phone number and I was going
               to give out the number of the New
               Jersey State Police but I thought I
               might get busted. After I got flunked
               in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail
               box, which was not in any way, shape
               or from my fault. I was putting out a
               cigarette, like I was told. It was weird.
               I'm so used to getting in a car and
               lighting up, because I'm not allowed to
               smoke at home, that I got in the driver's
               ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out
               of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller
               looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny
               out of my nose or something and I realized
               what the hell I was doing and I went to
               put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway,
               I was so pissed off at her reaction to
               the whole thing that I considered running
               an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school
               teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna
               use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost
               too much. I took it again and passed. But
               I had to work at Burger King to get the
               cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The
               car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and
               I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I
               can't prove it? I'm in high school, remember?

     He turns back to the DJ.

                              D.J.
               How did you get picked for this.

                              FERRIS
               It's kind of a long story but I've
               been doing alot of programming for
               NASA.

161  INT. SCHOOL. HALLWAY                                        161

     A even larger group of kids is listening to the blaster.
     They're cheering him on.

162  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE. BACKYARD                                162

     The Rottweiler is laying unconscious on the lawn. The flower
     arrangement is scattered all over the yard and the ceramic
     vase the flowers were in has obviously struck the dog. The
     broken pieces are all around the dog's head.

     He's smiling with great satisfaction.

                              ROONEY
               Sleep tight, pooch.

     He hears something in the house. His head snaps around. He
     drops down and peek in the windows.

     HIS POV

     A glimpse of a fleeting figure.

     CU. ROONEY

     His eyes dance in anticipation of revenge.

163  INT. HOUSE. FERRIS' ROOM                                    163

     Jeanie kicks the door open. The yardstick flings the covers
     and the pillows beneath them in the air. She stomps in and
     turns off the snoring synthesizer.

                              JEANIE
               I knew it!

     She grabs the phone and sits down. She dials a number.

164  EXT. HOUSE. FRONT                                           164

     Rooney sneaks around the side of the house. He slinks up on
     the porch. The front door's open. He peeks in.

165  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                           165

     Jeanie's on the phone.

                              JEANIE
               Is Mrs. Bueller there? Where is she?
               This is her daughter. Do you know where
               she is? Do you know when she'll be back?
               Do you know anything?

     She slams the phone down.

                              JEANIE
               The worm has luck like clams
               have body odor...

     She's startled by a noise downstairs. A smile spreads across
     her face. He's back and she's going to nail him.

166  INT. HOUSE. FOYER                                           166

     Rooney sneaks into the house. He looks around the foyer and
     heads into the kitchen.

167  INT. HOUSE. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY                                167

     Jeanie tiptoes down the stairs.

     Rooney sneaks through the kitchen into the den.

170  INT. HOUSE. KITCHEN                                         170

     Rooney comes out of the den, back into the kitchen. He
     crosses back toward the foyer.

171  INT. FOYER                                                  171

172  INT. KITCHEN                                                172

     Jeanie and Rooney come face-to-face. Jeanie squeals in
     horror. She doesn't recognize Rooney as himself but as an
     intruder. She drops into a karate stance and kicks Rooney in
     the face. He hits the deck. She flees back up the stairs.

173  INT. CAR                                                    173

     Boyd is sitting in the backseat of Joyce's car listening to
     the radio.

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               My input on the Star Wars defense
               plan was pretty substantial so I
               guess this is their way of rewarding
               me. I'm pretty flattered.

     EXT. CAR

     Joyce and her clients leave a show house and head toward the
     car.

     INT. CAR

     Boyd looks out the window as his parents and Joyce appear.

               Can you stay around and take a few
               phone calls?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'd really like to but I have a kidney
               operation in about an hour.

     EXT. CAR

     Joyce and her clients take one last look at the house.

                              JOYCE
               If you're willing to commit a
               little time and a little money
               to this place, you can really
               have something to be proud of.
               Don't let the black living room
               throw you off.

     She opens the car door.

     INT. CAR

     The door opens.

               A very interesting guy, Ferris Bueller.

     Joyce gets in. The clients get in the other side. A song
     starts.

                              JOYCE
                          (to the kid)
               Well, Boyd, how are you bearing
               up?

     The kid stares at her.

                              JOYCE
               Did I tell you I have a son
               your age?

                              BOYD
               Twice.

                              JOYCE
               His name is Ferris. I think you'd
               like him.

     Boyd sits up in the seat at the mention of Ferris' name.

                              BOYD
               Is he going up in the space shuttle
               in September?

     Joyce looks around at Boyd. She gives him a curious look.

                              JOYCE
               Not that I know of.

                              BOYD
               I knew he was bullshitting.

                              MOTHER
               Watch your mouth.

                              BOYD
               How do you watch your mouth?

                              JOYCE
               Do you know my son?

                              FATHER
               Don't pay any attention to him.
               He thinks it's cute to bait adults.

                              BOYD
               I don't think it's cute. I think
               it's fun.

     Joyce give him a puzzled smile and starts the car.

174  INT. FERRIS' ROOM                                           174

     Jeanie's on the phone. She's in a panic.

                              JEANIE
               This is not a phoeny phone call. There's
               an intruder, male caucasian, possibly armed,
               certainly weird, in our kitchen.
                          (pause)
               My name is Bueller.

     There's another pause. Jeanie's face drops.

                              JEANIE
               It's real nice that you hope my
               brother's feeling better but I'm
               in danger, okay? I'm very cute,
               I'm very alone and I'm very
               protective of my body. I'd rather
               not have it violated or killed.
               I need help!

175  INT. KITCHEN                                                175

     Rooney's plugging his bloody nose with paper towel. The
     intercom goes on.

                              JEANIE'S VOICE
               Excuse me. If whoever's in the house
               is still in the house, I'd like you
               to know that I have just called the police.
               If you have any brains whatsoever, you'll
               get your ass out of my house real quick.

     Rooney stiffens with fear.

                              JEANIE'S VOICE
               I'd also like to add that I have

     Rooney's car is hooked to a tow truck. It's parked in front
     of a fire hydrant and the windshield is decorated with
     parking citations. In the distance SIRENS WAIL.

     The three are waiting for the Ferrari. We HEAR TIRES
     SQUEALING, AN ENGINE REVING-OUT. Then the Ferrari pulls down
     the ramp and jams to a frightening stop. A BLACK GUY jumps
     out. Ferris hands him the parking stub.

                              FERRIS
               Just out of curiosity, what was
               your top speed coming down the
               ramp?

                              BLACK GUY
                          (matter-of-fact)
               About 60.

                              FERRIS
               Stunning!

     He hands him a buck and opens the door and pulls the
     passenger seat forward for Cameron.

                              FERRIS
               This is probably the last time you'll
               have to ride back here. Keep that in
               mind.

     Cameron gives him a look and squeezes in.

               What's next.

                              CAMERON
               Nothing. We return the car.

                              SLOANE
               We could go to my house. My parents
               aren't coming home until late.

                              FERRIS
               We have enough cash left for a quick
               flight to Peoria and back.

                              CAMERON
               Very funny.

     Ferris looks in the mirror and changes lanes. He glances
     down at the speedometer, then to the road. And back to the
     speedometer.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron? How many miles did you
               say this thing had when we left?

                              CAMERON
               One hundred and twenty six and
               halfway between three and four
               tenths. Why? How many miles are
               on it now?

     He glances down at the speedometer.

               Here's where Cameron goes berserk.

     The Ferrari pulls up at a stop light. We HEAR A THUNDERING,
     MUFFLED SCREAM.

     EXT. EXPRESSWAY

     The Ferrari is buzzing through traffic.

     INT. FERRARI

     Sloane turns in her seat and looks at Cameron. Her gesture
     is one of genuine support.

                              SLOANE
               You okay?

     CU. CAMERON

     His eyes are frozen in a mindless, vacant stare.

     CU. FERRIS

     He looks at Sloane. He's concerned.

                              FERRIS
               Hey, Cameron. It's okay. We'll fix
               it.

     CU. CAMERON

     He's still holding the stare. He starts to breathe heavily.
     He's trembling.

     CU. SLOANE

     She whips around in the seat and grabs his arms.

                              SLOANE
               Cameron! Cut it out! What's
               wrong?! Ferris!

     CU. FERRIS

     He shoots Sloane a look.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron, are you okay? It's
               no problem, really. Your old
               man won't know a thing. It's
               completely fixable.

     INT. FERRARI

     Sloane fires an angry look at Ferris.

                              SLOANE
               Shut-up! It is a problem! For
               him it's a problem. Nothing's
               a problem for you. But it's
               a problem for him! So, just
               shut-up.

     She turns back to Cameron.

                              SLOANE
               What can I do, Cameron?

     CU. FERRIS

     Eyes front. He knows what he's doing.

179  INT. FERRIS' HOUSE. FOYER                                   179

     The doorbell rings. The Ferris' tape is activated.

                              FERRIS VOICE
               Who is it?

     We hear a MALE VOICE over the intercom.

                              VOICE
               Anybody home?

                              FERRIS' VOICE
               I'm sorry that I can't come to
               the door right now...

     The tape continues as Jeanie hurtles down the stairs.

                              JEANIE
               I'm saved! Thank you, God!
               Thank you, thank you, thank you!

     She jumps the last few stairs and slides to the front door.
     She whips it open.

180  EXT. HOUSE. FRONT DOOR                                      180

     The door swings open.

                              JEANIE
               Thank...you...

     Her jaw goes slack. She blinks her eyes.

     HER POV

     The Delivery Man and a young ASSISTANT are standing at the
     door with floral arrangements. Spread all around them are
     more flowers. A sexy singing NURSE and a BALLOON MAN steps
     up on the porch.

                              NURSE
                          (sings)
               WE HOPE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER
               WE HOPE YOU'RE FELLING FIT
               WE...

     The door slams shut.

181  EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET                                    181

     Rooney's walking down the street. A school bus is crawling
     alongside him as kids hang out the windows. From inside we
     hear SHOUTING and seventeen different SONGS PLAYING ON
     BLASTERS. A top forty montage.

                              KID
               Hey, Mr. Rooney! What're you doing?

     Rooney doesn't respond.

                              ANOTHER KID
               Did you get in a fight?

     Rooney keep walking. The bus doors open. The DRIVER calls
     out to him.

                              DRIVER
               You want a lift?

     Rooney takes a few more steps. He stops. The bus stops.
     Rooney takes a deep breath. He climbs aboard the bus.

182  INT. BUS                                                    182

     The bus is jammed with WONKS and WEINERETTES. The passengers
     are silent as they watch Rooney shuffle down the aisle and
     take an empty seat next to a skinny, myopic GIRL.

     CU. GIRL

     She looks at Rooney and smiles. She pushes her Coke bottle
     glasses up on her nose.

     CU. ROONEY

     He looks vacantly at her.

     CU. GIRL

     She holds her smile.

                              GIRL
               I'll bet you never smelled a
               real school bus before.

     CU. ROONEY

     He stares at her.

     CU. GIRL

     She holds up a candy package.

                              GIRL
               Gummi Bear?

     CU. ROONEY

     He stares at her.

     CU. GIRL

     She puts one in her mouth.

                              GIRL
               They've been in pocket. They're
               real soft and warm.

     CU. BOY

     A rotund FRESHMAN BOY sitting across from Rooney is staring
     at him.

     CU. ROONEY

     He looks across to the kid.

     CU. BOY

     He leans forward.

                              FRESHMAN BOY
               It's kind of like being in the
               belly of the beast isn't it?

     CU. ROONEY

     He turns him eyes to the front. The bus jerks forward and
     pulls away.

183  EXT. BUS                                                    183

     It grinds through the gears as it heads down the quiet
     street. The BLASTERS go back on, the SHOUTING RESUMES.

184  EXT. PARK                                                   184

     Cameron's laying on a picnic table. Sloane's sitting beside
     him on the table. She's stroking his hair. Ferris WALKS INTO
     THE FOREGROUND. He addresses CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
               This may very well be for real. I
               think Cameron might have blown a
               micro-chip or two. He's always been
               a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do
               was give him a good day. We're
               gonna graduate in a couple of months.
               Then we have the summer. He'll work
               and I'll work. And we'll see each
               other at night and on the weekends
               but then he'll go to one school and I'll
               go to another. And basically that'll
               be it. As much as we like each other,
               the process of growing up will
               separate us.

     He begins to walk. We follow him.

                              FERRIS
               Sloane's a bigger problem. She still
               has another year of high school. How
               do I deal with that? I was serious when
               I said I'd marry her. I would. This isn't
               just teenage infatuation. That's what my
               parents call it. What do they call what they
               have? If that's love, I'll take infatuation.

     CU. CAMERON

     His eyes are closed. Sloane's stroking his hair.

                              FERRIS (VO)
               Cameron's never been in love. At
               least no one's ever been in love
               with him. He's gonna marry the first
               girl he lays. And she's gonna treat
               him like shit because he's gonna
               kiss her ass for giving him what he's
               built-up in his mind as the end-all,
               be-all of human existance. She won't
               respect him because you can't respect
               someone who kisses your ass. It just
               doesn't work.

     CU. SLOANE

     She's studying Cameron's face. She looks away.

                              SLOANE
               Ferris?

     CU. FERRIS

     He looks to the picnic table. Then back to CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
               I'm being tested here.

     He starts back to the picnic table.

                              FERRIS
               My best friend has flipped-out.
               Conventional wisdom would suggest
               a visit to the nearest trauma
               center. I wouldn't fault anybody
               for doing that. My, personally,
               I think this calls for something
               new, something bold, something wet
               and wild.

185  CU. JACUZZI JET                                             185

     UNDERWATER SHOT. A hyrdojet spews a gush of air bubbles.

     CU. BLASTER

     A finger pushes the PLAY button on the cassette. MUSIC COMES
     UP.

     CU. BEER CAN LID

     The finger pops a beer.

     CU. OREO PACKAGE

     A painted fingernail pierces the cellophane wrapper.

     INT. JACUZZI

     Ferris and Sloane are in Sloane's parents' Jacuzzi. Their
     clothes are tosssed around the deck. Cameron's been placed
     in a patio chair at the edge of the Jacuzzi. He's still
     catatonic. He's mummbling softly. Ferris is drinking a beer.
     Sloane's eating Oreos.

                              FERRIS
               You feeling any better, Cameron?

                              SLOANE
               The water's really nice. I wish
               you'd come in.

     CU. CAMERON

     Staring into space.

                              CAMERON
               Surgery...fire...move...

     CU. SLOANE AND FERRIS

     They look at each other. She offers him a cookie. He offers
     her his beer.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron? Do you think this because
               of the car or is it a combination
               of everything shitty in your life?

     CU. CAMERON

     He doesn't respond.

                              CAMERON
               Music...kiss...attack...

     CU. SLOANE AND FERRIS

     Sloane sips the beer.

                              FERRIS
               You just can't deal with anymore
               shit? The car took you into the
               red zone? Time for a reality check?

                              SLOANE
               Cameron? I could flip real easy, too.
               There's nothing wrong with it. At one
               time or another, everybody goes to
               the zoo.

                              FERRIS
               Maybe he was actually sick. Maybe
               he wasn't bullshitting himself.

     CU. CAMERON

     No response.

                              CAMERON
               Gesundheit...God...mercy...

     EXT. BACKYARD

     Ferris and Sloane watch their catatonic friend.

     CU. CAMERON

     He smiles.

     CU. SLOANE

     She leans forward and stares at Cameron.

     CU. FERRIS

     He cocks his head, wondering what Cameron's up to.

     CU. CAMERON

     He keels over forward.

     EXT. BACKYARD

     Cameron falls out of the chair and splashes down,
     face-first, into the water. Sloane screams. Ferris leaps for
     him.

     UNDERWATER

     Ferris struggles with Cameron's lifeless bulk.

     CU. SLOANE

     She's screaming. Ferris thrashes around in the water.

     UNDERWATER

     Ferris grabs Cameron's collar and rips him out of the water.

     EXT. BACKYARD

     Ferris sits Cameron on the edge of the Jacuzzi.

                              FERRIS
               CAMERON!

     CU. CAMERON

     His eyes are closed. He's lifeless.

     CU. FERRIS

     His face is a mask of terror. He shakes Cameron.

     CU. SLOANE

     She's screaming.

     CU. CAMERON

     A smile spreads across his face.

     CU. FERRIS

     He sees the smile. He stops shaking Cameron.

     EXT. JACUZZI

     Ferris and Cameron are looking at each other. Sloane's still
     screaming. She realizes that Cameron's okay. She stops
     screaming.

                              SLOANE
               What?

                              FERRIS
                          (Cameron)
               You asshole!

     Cameron's smiling.

                              SLOANE
               What?

     Ferris starts to laugh. Cameron explodes with laughter.
     Sloane's bewildered.

                              SLOANE
               What's so funny?

186  INT. POLICE STATION. WAITING ROOM                           186

     Jeanie's sitting on a wooden bench with a WASTED TEENAGE BOY
     in a Triumph t-shirt, long hair, torn jeans, creepers, studs
     and chains. He's studying her.

                              BOY
               Drugs?

                              JEANIE
               No, thank you. I'm straight.

                              BOY
               I meant, are you here for drugs?

     Jeanie stares at him.

                              JEANIE
               Why are you here?

                              BOY
               Drugs.

                              JEANIE
               I don't know why I'm here.

                              BOY
               Then why don't you go home?

                              JEANIE
               Why don't you put your thumb
               up your butt?

     The boy stares at her.

                              BOY
               You want to talk about your problem?

                              JEANIE
               With you? Are you serious?

                              BOY
               Yeah, I'm serious.

                              JEANIE
               Blow yourself.

     Jeanie turns away. The boy crosses his legs. Jeanie looks
     back at him.

                              JEANIE
               You really want to know what's wrong?

     The boy shrugs.

                              JEANIE
               Alright. If you've got the time,
               I've got the troubles. In a nutshell,
               I hate my brother. How's that?

                              BOY
               That's cool. Did you shoot him or
               something?

                              JEANIE
               No, not yet.

     The boy nods. He understands the emotion.

                              JEANIE
               I went home to confirm that the
               shithead was ditching school and
               a guy broke into the house and I
               called the cops and they picked me
               up for making a phoney phone call.

                              BOY
               What do you care if your brother
               ditches school?

     Jeanie stares at the boy.

                              JEANIE
               Why should he get to ditch school
               when everybody else has to go?

                              BOY
               You could ditch.

                              JEANIE
               I'd get caught.

                              BOY
               So, you're pissed at him because
               he ditches and doesn't get caught?

                              JEANIE
               Basically.

     The boy nods knowingly.

                              BOY
               Then your problem is you.

                              JEANIE
               Excuse me?

                              BOY
               Excuse you. You oughta spend a little
               more time dealing with yourself and
               a little less time worrying about
               what your brother does. It's just
               an opinion.

     Jeanie stares angrily at him. Partly because he's so bold
     and partly because he's so right.

                              BOY
               There's somebody you should talk
               to.

     Jeanie stares at him threateningly.

                              JEANIE
               If you say Ferris Bueller, you lose
               a testicle.

                              BOY
               You know him?

     CY. ACCELERATOR

     A brick's resting on the accelerator, holding it down.

     INT. CAMERON'S GARAGE

     Ferris, Cameron and Sloane are sitting in the garage. The
     Ferrari is jacked up. The wheels are turning. The engine's
     racing.

                              CAMERON
               The whole time I was just thinking
               things over. I was like, meditating.
               I was thinking about the future.
               And I realized it doesn't make
               and difference if the present
               goes to shit.

                              FERRIS
               I have a agree with you there.

                              SLOANE
               Really.

                              CAMERON
               I've been thinking all day that if
               you could only have the use of one
               word, what would it be?

                              FERRIS
               Sloane is naked before your eyes and
               you're thinking about words?

                              SLOANE
               God bless you, Cameron.

                              CAMERON
               Thank you, Sloane.

                              CAMERON
               If you guys only had one word, what
               would it be?

                              FERRIS
               I can't believe you'd think up something
               like with a naked girl in a jacuzzi
               right in front of you.

                              SLOANE
               Come on, Ferris, answer his question.

                              FERRIS
               Bathroom.

                              SLOANE
               I'd say...

     She thinks.

                              FERRIS
               Cash.

                              CAMERON
               It's the only word you could
               ever use.

                              FERRIS
               Hello.

                              SLOANE
               Love.

                              FERRIS
               And what is you loathe somebody?
               Are you going to say "love" every
               time you see them?

                              SLOANE
               It's better than "hello".

                              FERRIS
               Hellos' generic.

                              SLOANE
               You wanna be generic?

                              CAMERON
               It's help.

     Cameron smiles at his wisdom. Ferris and Sloane think about
     it. It's a good choice. Cameron gets up and walks to the
     Ferrari.

                              CAMERON
               The word is help.

     Cameron peeks in the window.

     CU. ODOMETER

     Nothing's happening.

     INT. GARAGE

     Cameron pulls his head out of the car.

                              CAMERON
               Ferris? It's not working.

     Ferris looks up.

                              CAMERON
               The miles aren't coming off, running
               it in reverse.

                              FERRIS
               I thought that might be a problem.
               Let's crack open the odometer and
               roll it back by hand.

     Cameron shakes his head.

                              CAMERON
               I got a better idea. It's cool.

     He walks back around behind the Ferrari.

                              CAMERON
               Seventeen years and I've never
               taken a stand. Now, I'm gonna
               do it. I'm taking a stand against
               my father, against my family,
               against myself, against my past,
               my present and my future. I will
               not sit idly by as events that affect
               me unfold to change the course of
               my life. I will take a stand and I
               will defend it. When my father comes
               home tonight, he's finally going
               to have to deal with me. Good or
               bad, I'm taking a stand.

     CU. FERRIS

     He turns to CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
               This is a big U-2 fan.

     CU. SLOANE

     She smiles proudly at Cameron. She applauds him.

     CU. CAMERON

     He's serious and determined. He has made up his mind and it
     appears that it won't be changed by anyone but himself.

     CU. TIRES

     It's spinning wildly.

     CU. MERCEDES BUMPER

     Cameron's foot rests on the bumper. A beat and it gives a
     mighty shove.

     CU. TIRE

     The spinning tires slam down on the cement.

     INT. GARAGE

     Cameron has kicked the Ferrari off the jack. It squeals out
     of the garage in a cloud of blue tire smoke. A $50,000
     unmanned investment heading backwards down a driveway.

     CU. SLOANE AND FERRIS

     They're in shock.

     EXT. HOUSE

     The Ferrari shoots down the driveway.

     INT. GARAGE

     Cameron watches the car go. He's strangely placcid about the
     impending disaster. Ferris and Sloane are bewildered.

     THEIR POV

     The Ferrari travels down the driveway, across the street,
     over the curb into the wooded property opposite the house.

     CU. TREE

     The Ferrari's brief journey ends as it smacks a tree trunk.

     INT. GARAGE

     Ferris and Sloane exchange baffled looks. They look at
     Cameron. He's proud and bold.

                              FERRIS
               What was that about?

                              SLOANE
               This has to be a dream.

                              FERRIS
               Cameron? One quick question.
               Why'd you do that?

     Cameron holds his proud posture for a beat. Then a look of
     bewilderment comes over his face. He shoots a look to
     Ferris. A puzzled look.

                              FERRIS
               You trashed the car.

     Cameron looks across the street.

                              SLOANE
               Why?

                              CAMERON
               I took a stand.

                              FERRIS
               No, Cameron. You wrecked a car.

     Cameron thinks for a moment. Then he regains his confidence.

                              CAMERON
               It's okay.

     Ferris looks across the street at the car.

                              FERRIS
               I have an idea. If you're interested.

     Cameron looks at him. He shakes his head.

                              CAMERON
               I'm gonna handle it.

                              FERRIS
               I think this could work.

                              CAMERON
               No, thanks. I want to deal with
               it by myself.

                              SLOANE
               What about your one word?

                              CAMERON
               You already did it. If I need it
               again, I'll use it.

     He smiles. He raises am impish eyebrow.

                              CAMERON
               It's cool. I'm loose.

188  INT. POLICE STATION. OFFICE                                 188

     Joyce is talking with the juvenile officer. Outside the
     office, on the bench, we see Jeanie and the boy making out.

                              JOYCE
               She's never been in trouble before.
               This is a shock to me. First, I
               don't know why she wasn't at school.
               Second, I don't know why she'd call
               you with this story about a rapist.

                              OFFICER
               For whatever reasons she did it,
               I think she'd had a good scare.

                              JOYCE
               I hope so. I appreciate your calling
               me. I can assure you that her father
               and I will have a long talk with her.

     The gathers her purse and jacket and stands.

                              JOYCE
               Thank you.

                              OFFICER
               Oh, by the way, I hope you son's
               feeling better.

     Joyce looks at the officer curiously.

                              OFFICER
               Tell him, all the guys at the
               station here are pulling for
               him.

189  INT. POLICE STATION. WAITING ROOM                           189

     Jeanie quickly breaks the embrace with the boy as Joyce
     steps out of the juvenile officer's room. She's still a
     little bewildered that everybody knows Ferris was ill.
     Jeanie wipes her lips and sits up straight. The boy adjusts
     his pants to better hide his passion.

                              JEANIE
                          (to the boy)
               If you keep this to yourself, I
               think we can probably get it on
               pretty good.

                              BOY
               For sure.

     Jeanie stands up.

                              JEANIE
               Hi.

                              JOYCE
               Don't "hi" me, young lady. Get
               your stuff.

     Jeanie reaches down for her purse.

                              BOY
               What's your name?

                              JEANIE
               Jean. What's yours?

                              BOY
               Garth Volbeck.

190  EXT. SLOANE'S BACKYARD                                      190

     Sloane and Ferris are standing at the back fence.

                              SLOANE
               I had a great time today.

                              FERRIS
               Yeah. It was pretty cool.

                              SLOANE
               You think Cameron's gonna be
               alright?

                              FERRIS
               Sure. He had to so it, I guess.
               His old man had it coming. He'll
               be okay. I'd be worried if he'd
               taken my idea.

     Sloane smiles knowingly.

                              SLOANE
               You didn't have an idea, did you?

                              FERRIS
               Not a glimmer.

                              SLOANE
               You're so smart.

                              FERRIS
               No. I'm just real loose.

     He kisses her.

                              FERRIS
               I'll call you tonight.

     Sloane nods. Ferris jumps the fence and takes off across the
     backyards. Sloane watches him go. A huge smile spreads
     across her face.

                              SLOANE
               I LOVE YOU!

     She backs away from the fence. MUSIC FADES UP.

                              SLOANE
               He's gonna marry me. I know it.

     She turns and runs into the house.

191  EXT. BACKYARD                                               191

     Ferris sprints across a backyard. He jumps a plaster elf.

192  EXT. ANOTHER BACKYARD                                       192

     Ferris vaults a fence. He runs directly for a swimming pool.
     He's approaching it from the side. He leaps, hits the diving
     board, springs off, does a flip and lands on the grass on
     the other side of the pool.

193  CU. BEDSPREAD                                               193

     Neatly bundles stacks of bills and rolled coins. A
     significant amount of cash.

     CU. SLOANE

     She's writing.

     CU. PIECE OF PAPER

     We see a portion of the typewritten letter as she signs it.

               "...in the amount of $1,765.33. It
               gives us great pleasure to assist
               you in performance of your worthy

               so desperately in need.

194  EXT. FERRIS' STREET                                         194

     He's running down the middle of the street. A car honks.
     Ferris moves to the side. The car pulls around him.

     INT. CAR.

     Tom's at the wheel. He glances in the mirror. He does a
     take.

     HIS POV. MIRROR

     We see Ferris cut across a front lawn and into a house.

     CU. TOM

     He realizes it couldn't be Ferris.

195  INT. HOUSE                                                  195

     Ferris runs through the kitchen, past a WOMAN, fixing dinner
     and out her backdoor. The Woman looks up curiously.

196  EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE                                          196

     Tom pulls in the driveway. He parks and gets out. Joyce
     pulls in from the other direction.

197  EXT. HOUSE. BACK PORCH                                      197

     Ferris tries the door. It's locked. He reaches down and
     lifts the doormat.

     CU. PORCH

     The outline of a key in the dirt under the mat. The key's
     gone. The toe of a chewed-up dress shoe steps INTO FRAME. An
     OMNIOUS CHORD IS STRUCK.

     CU. FERRIS

     He stares up in horror.

     HIS POV

     Rooney's looking down at him. He's holding the house key.

     EXT. PORCH

     Ferris stands up. He smiles.

                              ROONEY
               Looking for this?

                              FERRIS
               Yes.

                              ROONEY
               I got you, Ferris. This time I finally
               got you.

     Ferris is caught. There's no way out. Rooney gloats
     severely.

                              ROONEY
               How does another year of high
               school sit with you?

     Suddenly, the backdoor opens. Jeanie looks out. She feigns
     joy and relief. She rushes Ferris and hugs him.

                              JEANIE
               Thank God, you're alright! We've
               been worried sick!

     CU. FERRIS

     A moment of curiosity. Then it dawns on him what's
     happening. He smiles.

     CU. ROONEY

     His eyes dart from Ferris to Jeanie to Ferris. His victory
     is evaporating.

     EXT. PORCH

     Jeanie breaks the embrace.

                              JEANIE
                          (to Rooney)
               Thank you for bringing him home,
               Mr. Rooney.
                          (to Ferris)
               You better get up in bed tight
               now.

     Ferris limps into the house.

                              JEANIE
               Can you imagine someone as sick as
               Ferris trying to walk home from the
               hospital?
                          (shakes her head)
               Kids!

     CU. ROONEY

     He's dumbfounded.

     CU. JEANIE

     She raises her hands and strikes a karate pose. A huge smile
     passes over her face.

     CU. ROONEY

     A look of terror as he realizes that is was Jeanie who
     kicked him and that Jeanie knows it was he who she kicked.

     EXT. PORCH

     Jeanie steps into the house.

198  INT. HOUSE                                                  198

     The door closes on Rooney's defeated, lost, dejected,
     bewildered face. Not only has he lost Ferris again, he has
     Jeanie to deal with next year.

199  EXT. YARD. CU. DOG                                          199

     The click of the door wakes him up. His head pops up off the
     grass.

     CU. ROONEY

     He senses new danger. We hear AN O.C. GROWL. Rooney squeezes
     his eyes shut.

200  INT. KITCHEN                                                200

     Kimberly and Todd are sitting at the kitchen table watching
     TV and eating cereal. They look up at Ferris as he comes in
     from outside.

                              TODD
               Ferris?  Does my head look like
               it's getting bigger?

     Ferris leans against the counter as he tries to catch his
     breath. He looks at his little brother.

                              FERRIS
               No, but Kimberly's is.

     He crosses to the refrigerator and opens it. Kimberly feels
     her head.

                              KIMBERLY
                          (to Todd)
               Is he serious?

                              TODD
               I think so.

                              KIMBERLY
               Oh, shit!

     Ferris takes out a bottle of orange juice out of the
     refrigerator and drinks straight from the bottle. Jeanie
     comes in.

                              FERRIS
               Thanks, Jeanie.

                              JEANIE
               No problem.

                              FERRIS
               By the way, I borrowed some cash
               from you. I'll pay you back.

                              JEANIE
               You don't have to.

                              FERRIS
               I want to.

                              JEANIE
               You don't have to. I've been ripping
               off your wallet for years.

     Ferris gives her a proud smile.

201  EXT. HOUSE                                                  201

     Joyce and Tom head up to the kitchen.

202  INT. KITCHEN                                                202

     Ferris and Jeanie exit the kitchen as Joyce and Tom enter.

                              JOYCE
                          (to Todd and Kimberly)
               Hi, guys.

                              KIMBERLY
               Is my head swelling up?

203  INT. HOUSE. FOYER                                           203

     The foyer is jammed with floral arrangements, plants and
     gifts. Ferris and Jeanie step gingerly through the flowers
     and head upstairs.

                              JEANIE
               I'm sorry I've been riding your
               buns for so long.

                              FERRIS
               It's completely cool.

                              JOYCE (OC)
               Ferris!

     Ferris continues up the stairs. He affects a sickly voice.

                              FERRIS
               Upstairs, Mom!

204  INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING                                   204

     Ferris and Jeanie stop.

                              JEANIE
               Do you know a guy named Garth
               Volbeck?

                              FERRIS
               Vaguely.

                              JEANIE
               Is he cool?

                              FERRIS
               He's cool. But stay away from his
               brother.

     Ferris walks into the room, brushes the crumbs off his hands
     and peels off his shirt. He climbs into bed. No sooner are
     the covers over him than the bedroom door opens and Joyce
     and Tom walk in. They walk over to the bed. Joyce sits down.

                              JOYCE
               Honey?

     CU. FERRIS

     The same deathly face he had in the morning. Tongue out,
     eyes bulging.

                              TOM (OC)
               Ferris? How do you feel?

     He pulls in his tongue to speak.

                              FERRIS
                          (deathly gasp)
               150% better, thank you.

205  INT. BEDROOM                                                205

     Tom and Joyce hover over him with deep concern.

                              FERRIS
               I'm much better, really. Please,
               don't make me stay home again. I
               want to go to school. I'm graduating
               in June and I...

                              TOM
               Ferris. You're sick. There's no point
               pushing yourself and making it worse.

                              FERRIS
               Maybe you're right, Dad.

                              TOM
               I know I'm right.

     Joyce leans over and kisses him forehead.

                              JOYCE
               How did you get so sweet?

                              FERRIS
               Years of practice.

     Tom pats Ferris on the rump. He and Joyce exit.

     CU. FERRIS

     The hideous face. A beat and we HEAR THE BEDROOM DOOR CLOSE.
     Ferris looks at CAMERA.

                              FERRIS
                          (happy sigh)
               Yeah, life is a carousel. A
               great big crazy ball of pure
               living, breathing joy and delight.

     He rolls over on his back and puts his hands behind his
     head.

                              FERRIS
               You gotta get one.

     He smiles.

FADE IN:

1	EXT.  DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAY

	Somewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert.

	CREDITS  ROLL

	WRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913

	OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.

2	EXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY

	The mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
	Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.

3	INT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of
the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside
him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in
his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room.

						PROFESSOR
					(deciphering)
				"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."

	His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.

						PROFESSOR
				"..the black hole like a door is open...
				Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..."
				See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil
				... make sure you get the snake!

	The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil,
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U.
Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist.

						BILLY
				And when is this door opening snake act
				supposed to occur?

	The Professor's fingers touch the signs.

						PROFESSOR
				..if this is the five..and this the thousand..

	He calculates.

						PROFESSOR
				Every five thousand years..

						BILLY
					(kidding)
				So I have some time..

	He reaches for the pad.

	ANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water
bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock.

						PRIEST
				I will take it to them my son.

	Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				Go with God.. be safe from Evil..

	The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing
him.
	As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

	ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.

						PROFESSOR
				"..then arrange the elements of life against
				the Terror just so.."

	His fingers run on.

						PROFESSOR
				"..Water..fire..earth..air..four
				elements around the fifth.."

	His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by
all the others.

	The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into
the skin.

	ANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails.

						PROFESSOR
				Aziz!  Light!

	The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.

						PRIEST
				Lord forgive me.. they already know too,
				much..

						PROFESSOR
				"..in which all the history of the Universe resides
				..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil.."

						PRIEST (V.O.)
				Amen..

	The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup
from the skin.

						PROFESSOR
				Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing..
				the greatest find in history..can you imagine
				the implications.

						PRIEST
				Only too well... here you must be
				parched..

	He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost
to his lips when..

						PROFESSOR
				I mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

	In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin.

						PROFESSOR
				Here the Good.. Here the Evil..

	As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the
water skin, drinking the leakage.

						PROFESSOR
				Here..

	He points to the Five Elements.

						PROFESSOR
				A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am
				going to be famous.

						PRIEST
				Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

	The Priest hands Billy a cup.

						PRIEST
				Drink!

						PROFESSOR
				To fame.. salud..

	The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...

						PROFESSOR
				We cannot toast with water.. Billy !
				In my sack.. the Grappa!

	The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel.

4	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.

5	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag.  He comes upon a
machine pistol.  When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention.  He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear.  Billy is
paralyzed.

6	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor keeps reading over the inscription.

						PROFESSOR
				"..this perfect person.. this perfect
				being.." I do not understand this.. perfect?

						PROFESSOR
				Where is that boy? Billy!

7	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but
sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him.  He
begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest's potion..

8	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor reads the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				And this divine Light they talk
				about.. what is Divine light?

	At that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again.  The light
fails.

						PROFESSOR
					(without turning)
				Aziz light!

	The room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

						PROFESSOR
				Better.. this is the most unbelievable thing
				I have ever seen..

	The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS.  A dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  Aziz is fast asleep.

						PROFESSOR
					(uncomprehending)
				...Uh, yes?

	The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.

						PRIEST
				Master... He was about to discover everything,
				but I had the situation under control.

	The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.

						PROFESSOR
					(in a panic)
				Who are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen
				Sie Deutsch?

9	INT.  TUNNEL

	Billy staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.

10	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM

	The KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				What did I do wrong?

	The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

						KOMMANDER
				Servant, you and the thousand guards
				before you... You have done your work well,
				but we have to recover the elements. War will
				soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

	The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				Unbelievable!!!

	The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS
	waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  He is followed by his men.  The Priest slips in
behind them.

11	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-
shaped.  In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements.  In the middle, an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar.  The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment.

						PRIEST
					(to himself)
				The Fifth Element...

						KOMMANDER
				Take them and put them in a safe place.

	His men carry out his order.

12	INT.  ROOM 1  TEMPLE - DAY

	Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.

13	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.

						PRIEST
					(moved)
				Will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place?

						KOMMANDER
				When mankind comes to its senses.
				We will return.

						PRIEST
				Knowing mankind as I do, that could take
			centuries!

						KOMMANDER
				Time is of no importance, only life
				is important.

	The Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

	Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

	A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the Priest.

						KOMMANDER
				When EVIL returns so shall we.

						PRIEST
					(head lowered)
				We will be ready, Lord.

	Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

						BILLY
				Stop.

	Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to
close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.

						PRIEST
				No!!!  Don't!!!

	The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander.
The WARRIORS are in a panic.

						CLERK
				Hurry, Kommander!  The wall's closing!!!

	The wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast
room fills up like an hourglass.

						KOMMANDER
				A mission is a mission, Savoia.
				You'll learn that.

	The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get
through it.  His
	armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and
the case through.

						KOMMANDER
				My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..

	The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs
	through the huge piles of sand.

14	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings.

15	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried.

16	EXT.  DESERT - DAY

	The huge ship's main hatch closes.

17	EXT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	The ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.

18	EXT.  PYRAMIDS

	A gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.

19	EXT.  EARTH  ORBIT

	The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos.

	WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATER

	Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.

20	INT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOM

	CU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight
lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the
professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the
ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse.

						STAEDERT
				Don't you have anything?  Not even
				a temperature?

						CAPTAIN
				The thermo-analyzers have jammed.
				One of them reads over a million degrees,
				the other's at minus 5000...
				Never seen anything like it.

						TECHNICIAN
				It's taking shape.

21	EXT.  SPACE

	In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color.

						CAPTAIN
					(in awe)
				What the hell can it be?

						TECHNICIAN
				Hook-up with the president in one
				minute, General.

	General Staedert remains calm.

						STAEDERT
				...Send out a probe.

22	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE  MANHATTAN

	LINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined
and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office.
There's a crisis in the air.  The President's AIDE leans down to his ear.

						AIDE
				On air in 30 seconds.

	In the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of
Egypt.  A younger man DAVID, 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old
man.

23	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						CAPTAIN
				President on line sir..

	General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				Staedert, do you read me?

						STAEDERT
				I can hear you, Mr. President, but I
				can't see you .

	The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
	His face fills the screen.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				Is that better?

						STAEDERT
				Perfect, Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I have to address the Supreme Council
				in 10 minutes.
				Just the facts, General.

						STAEDERT
				There are no results from the chemical
				and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
				calibers are overshot..we're hoping a
				thermo nucleatic imaging..

						PRESIDENT
				(exasperated)
				What you are saying is you don't know
				what this..thing..is.

	Consternation reigns in the President's office.

						STAEDERT
				Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is
				it just keeps getting bigger!

						PRESIDENT
				Options.

						STAEDERT
				Wait or act.

						PRESIDENT
				Recommendations.

						STAEDERT
				My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
				ask questions later.
				I don't like uninvited guests.

						PRESIDENT
				Gentlemen?

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				I think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive, without first
				taking the time to study it more!
				Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

						PRESIDENT
					(worried)
				No... it's just getting bigger.

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				So do people, but that's no reason to shoot
				them.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				The security of the Federated Territories is
				and remains number one priority.
					(to the military)
				I suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is
				acceptable to you?

	All the Generals nod "yes"

						PRESIDENT
				All right, then! Staedert?

						PRIEST (O.S.)
				Mr. President?

	The President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.

						PRESIDENT
				...Yes?

	The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
	Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.

						PRIEST
				Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.
				I have a different theory to offer you,
				Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I'm listening.

						CORNELIUS
				Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers

				Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

						PRESIDENT

				One more reason to shoot first eh?

	All the Generals nod in agreement.

						CORNELIUS
				Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
				Shooting would only make it stronger.

						STAEDERT
				Mr. President, we're at crisis point.

	The President looks puzzled.

						PRESIDENT
				Your theory is interesting Father but
				I don't think we have time to go into it
				right now!

						CORNELIUS
				Time is of no importance, Mr. President.
				Only life is important.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				That's exactly what we are going to try and do:
				Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our

				You may fire when ready.

A black crust immediately covers it.

29	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					(consulting new data)
				Its structure has just solidified on the surface,

						CORNELIUS
				The most terrible intelligence imaginable,
				Mr. President.

	The President hesitates.

						CAPTAIN
				...The ship is in combat formation.
				The missile is loaded, General.

					(uneasy)
				Staedert?  Give me a minute...
				I have a doubt.

						STAEDERT
					(cold)
				I don't, Mr. President.

30	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The
explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water.
Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger.

31	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Staedert looks worried.

						STAEDERT
				Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum

				Yes, Sir.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you
				destroy it?

						STAEDERT
				I'm about to, Mr. President.

32	EXT.  SPACESHIP

	A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.
And literally doubles in size.

						SCIENTIST
				The planet's diameter has greatly
				increased and it's moving toward the ship.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  Get out of there immediately!
				I don't want an incident, do you hear me,
				Staedert?

						STAEDERT
					(worried)
				...What do we have that's bigger than 240?

						CAPTAIN
				Nothing, General.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert, get out of there!  That's an order!

	A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert's spaceship.

						STAEDERT
					(eyes wide)
				... Good God!

	The flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that....

33	INT.  APARTMENT

	... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs
his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,
unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there.
The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It
in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a
light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it
	still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I'm coming.

	He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet
wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the
bed makes itself automatically.

						KORBEN
					(on the phone)
				Yeah?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud! Finger here.

	He opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for
a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection.

						KORBEN

					(to the cat)
				Hi sweetie!

	...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas

						FINGER (V.O.)
				I love you too Major, but you haven't called
				me that since basic training.

				I was talking to the cat.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer
				your cat to the real thing.

	...A picture of Korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day.

						KORBEN
				At least, the cat comes back.

						FINGER (V.O.)
					(ironical)
				You still pining for that two timing bitch.
				Forget her.
				There are a million women out there.

						KORBEN
				I don't want a million - I just want
				one.  A perfect one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Don't exist bud.

	...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter.

						KORBEN
				I just found a picture of you.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How do I look?

						KORBEN
				Like shit.

	Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It
does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
GEMINI croquettes.
	On the packet is an ad:
	WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				 Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta bring
				me your hack for the 6 month overhaul.  A.S.A.P.

	Korben heats up some brackish water.

						KORBEN
					(sighs)
				I don't need one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				You forgetting who sat next to you for
				a thousand missions.
				I know how you drive.

						KORBEN
				Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a
				space fighter!!

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How many points you got left on your
				license?

						KORBEN
					(lying)
				Uh... at least fifty.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				In your dreams! See you tonight!

	Finger has hang up.  Korben sighs and does the same.  He gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  The cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  Korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup.

	The cat meows.  Korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer.

					(to the President)
				The Mondoshawans don't belong to the
				Federated Territories, but they are peaceful...
				in their possession are the four elements of life.
				These elements when they are gathered around a fifth:
				The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect
				life......

	The SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the
bottom half of his body.  Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones.

						CORNELIUS
				..will produce what the ancients called the
				light of creation, the light of total goodness
				which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

	The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element.

						PRESIDENT
				But what happens if instead of
				this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL
				who stands here?

						CORNELIUS
				White turns to black.  Light to Dark.
				Life to Death.  For all eternity.

				Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at

	Korben is about to exit the apartment.

						KORBEN
				Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your

	In response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge
	gun, brandished by a nervous MUGGER, pointing right in his face.

						MUGGER
				The cash man!

						KORBEN
				Been here long?

						MUGGER
				Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow
				you into tomorrow!

	Unperterbed, Korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon.

						KORBEN
				Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium.
				Neuro charged assault model?

						MUGGER
					(off balance)
				Uh..

						KORBEN
				You know you could hurt someone with
				this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

	The mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon.

						MUGGER
				It's not?

						KORBEN
				You gotta push the little yellow button...

	Korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his
advice.

						MUGGER
				Thanks..

						KORBEN
				You're welcome..

	And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right
hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun.

						KORBEN
				..you know these things are VERY illegal..
				you could get in a shit load of trouble..
				I better hang onto it for you..

	As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is
full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers
to his feet and runs off.

	Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches

	An arm, on a surgical cart, moves down the hall of the Nucleological
Center, the most sterile of environments.

	PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH, age 60, hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO.

						MUNRO
				This is all that survived?

						MACTILBURGH
				Actually only one cell survived..

						MUNRO
				Have you identified it?

						MACTILBURGH
				It's not that easy..we've never encountered
				anything like it before..you see normal human
				beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is
				more than enough for any species to perpetuate
				itself..This one has 200,000.

						MUNRO
				Talk English Doc.

						MACTILBURGH
				This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite
				genetic knowledge stored inside.
				Almost like it was...engineered.

						MUNRO
				Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

						MACTILBURGH
				Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

	They pass into the lab.

53	INT.  LABORATORY

	The two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in
the middle with the metal glove inside.  A DNA chain scrolls on the computer
screen.

						MACTILBURGH
					(rather fascinated)
				The compositional elements of his DNA
				chain are the same as ours, there are simply
				more of them tightly packed.
				His knowledge is probably limitless..

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

						MACTILBURGH
				We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
				The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

	Munro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to
open the
	self-destruct box.

						MUNRO
				OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...
				otherwise I turn him into cat food.

	Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the
sell-destruct button, ready to use it.  Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.

						DOCTOR
				Three seconds to ultra-violet protection.

	A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.

						MACTILBURGH
					(to Munro)
				...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction
				of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly
				greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
				to react, to protect themselves.
				That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

						MUNRO
					(disgusted)
				Wonderful!

	The meter slows, drops to zero.

						ASSISTANT
				... End of reconstruction, beginning of
				reanimation .

	A whoosh of air in the glass chamber.  Captain Munro has his hand on the
self-destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been
reborn.

						MACTILBURGH
					(pushing a button)
				Activate life support system.

	An electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside
to jerk.
	After a few moments of silence, the SOUND of a heartbeat fills the room
over the loudspeaker.

						ASSISTANT
				Life support system activated.

	The Supreme Being is alive once again.

						MACTILBURGH
				Remove the shield.

	The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly
reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful.  Munro stands there
gaping.  Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being.  Mactilburgh glances
at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct button.

						MACTILBURGH
					(with a smile)
				I told you ... perfect!

	Munro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty.

						MUNRO
				...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives
				before she wakes up.

	Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches
the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and
screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding.

						GIRL
					(very angry)
				Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra
				mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla.
				Tokemata tokemata!  Seno santonoi-aypa!
				Minoi ay Cheba!  Givomana seno!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What's she saying?

						MACTILBURGH
					(to his ASSISTANT)
				Activate the phonic detector.

	The girl kicks the window repeatedly.

						MACTILBURGH
				And give her a light sedative...
				and something to wear!

	The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor
in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly.
Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with
undisguised pleasure.

						MUNRO
					(to Mactilburgh)
				This thing solid?

						MACTILBURGH
					(smiling)
				An elephant couldn't crack it.

	The Girl finishes dressing.

						GIRL
					(angrily)
				Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!

	Munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.

						MUNRO
					(with a smile)
				You're gonna have to learn to communicate
				better than that angel if you want out.

	Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams
her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The
chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The
girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps
out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her.
She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He
sets off a general alarm.

54	INT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY

	The girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad
of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The
girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air
shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it.

						CHIEF
				Get me a chair or a stepladder The rest of you
				go through the main ventilation!

55	INT.  VENTILATION DUCT  LABORATORY

56	EXT.  LEDGE  LABORATORY - DAWN

	She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has
become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run
vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.

						CHIEF
					(to his men)
				Go on follow her!

	The COPS stare into the gaping void.

						COP
				...No way.

	The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This in the police.  Your status is illegal.
				Please put up your hands and follow our
				instructions!

	The girl feels trapped.  She looks down into the endless 450 below and
all the cars flying underneath her.  Then she raises her arms... and dives
off.

57	INT.  POLICE  CAR - NIGHT

	Korben tries to control his car, reeling from the impact.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				You have just had an accident.
				Seven points have been temporarily
				removed...

	Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.

						VOICE / KORBEN
				You have one point left on your license.
				Have a good day.

	Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive
and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown.

						GIRL
				Akina delutan, nou-shan.

						KORBEN
					(lost)
				...'Scuse me?

	A police car with wailing sirens halts in front of Korben.

						COP

				You have an unauthorized passenger in your

				Please leave your hands on the wheel.
				Thank you for your cooperation.

						KORBEN
					(obeying)
				Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left
				on my license and I gotta get to the garage!

	The police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns
point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
	Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

	Her POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an
orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots
to Korben a look of pure distress.

						GIRL
					(irresistible)
				Please... HELP...

	Korben can't resist her plea.

						KORBEN
				Don't put me in this position...
				I can't... I'm late as it is...

	But he cannot say no to her eyes.

						KORBEN
				Finger's gonna kill me.

	Korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as
he roars away.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Your license has been revoked.
				Would you please....

	Korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.

						KORBEN
				I hate when people cry...
				I got no defense...

	The police car takes out after him, sirens screeching.  An insane chase
ensues.

59	INT.  NEW YORK  STREETS - DAY

	Korben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air.  The cops
have trouble following him but then another cop car comes to join in the
fun.  Korben drives like a man possessed, nothing can stop him. Except the
dead-end he's just come up against.

						GIRL
				Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!

						KORBEN
				It there's one thing I don't need advice on,
				it's how to drive.

	Korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway,
	ripping his taxi light from the roof.  The police car smashes into the
wall.  The other one brakes just in time.

						COP
				Shit! Attention all-patrol cars!

	The car makes a U-turn, looking for a wider passageway.

60	EXT.  NEW YORK  STREET

	The police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. The dead-end is empty .
Korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.  Seeing nothing, the
	police drive away.

						KORBEN
				We'll wait till things quiet down a bit.
				You mind?

	The girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				...Priest...

						KORBEN
				You're not that bad... Come on we'll
				get you to a doctor.

	The girl hands him the handle of the case, struck with the three Egyptian
suns.

						GIRL

				Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

	The girl nods, then faints.  Korben is somewhat lost faced with so much
mystery.

	Cornelius closes the door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				She's not my bride, she's my fare.
				She's looking for this Vito Cornelius.
				According to the phone guide he lives here.

						CORNELIUS
					(curious)
				That's me.  But I don't know who she is...

	Korben hands him the metal handle with the three Egyptian suns, stamped
on it.

				Who are you?

						KORBEN
				I brought the girl remember?

						CORNELIUS
				The girl?

	Cornalius gets up.  He looks at the handle.

						KORBEN
				Yeah! She dropped in on me. I mean
				on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre
				language...

	And then it dawns on Cornelius who the girl is.

						CORNELIUS
					(eyes riveted on her)
				He's a she!

						KORBEN
					(bemused)
				You noticed...

						CORNELIUS
					(face shining)
				There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up,
				but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's
				most precious possession! She is... perfect!

						KORBEN
				So you do know her.

						CORNELIUS
				Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

	Cornelius runs into the next room.  Korben looks at the girl, goes to
slap her, then changes his mind.

	Her beauty troubles him.  He hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek.
Her skin seems so soft, so fragile.

						KORBEN
				Perfect...

63	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of
breath.

						CORNELIUS
				It's a miracle!!!

						DAVID
					(worried)
				What is?

						CORNELIUS
					(babbling crazily)
				I can't wear these clothes! This calls
				for dignity!
				I have to dress the part!

	He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in,
disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending.

64	INT  LIVING ROOM.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT

	Korben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond.  He
looks around then kisses her on the lips.  The girl's eyes snap open.
When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his
chin.

						GIRL
					(angry)
				Eto Akta Gamat!

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				I'm sorry, it's just that... I was
				told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

	The girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled.

						KORBEN
				You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't
				have kissed you... especially since we
				haven't been introduced and...
					(he pulls out a business card)
				Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is
				Korben, Korben Dallas.
				Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll
				need a cab one day.  I'll be happy to open
				the door this time!.

	The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal.

65	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	Cornelius is lost in the closet.

						DAVID
				Father, will you please explain what's
				going on?

						CORNELIUS
				The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here,

66	INT.  LIVING ROOM

						KORBEN
				...What's your name?

						GIRL
					(after a moment)
				Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
				Ekbat De Sebat.

						KORBEN
					(polite)
				Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname,
				something a little... shorter?

						GIRL
				...Leeloo.

	Korben is falling in love.

						KORBEN
				That's... really cute...

	Cornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him.
	He bows before her.

						CORNELIUS
				Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

						LEELOO
				Corn-i-Lius?

						CORNELIUS
					(bowing)
				At your service.

	LEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh.
	Korben smiles.

						DAVID
				Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

						CORNELIUS
				Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on
				her gloves!

	David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to
lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out.

						KORBEN
				They all like this in your family, father?

						CORNELIUS
				She's an exception..

						CORNELIUS
				Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

						KORBEN
				Dallas. Korben Dallas.

	Cornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben
leaving.

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much.
				A thousand times over!

						KORBEN
				I might call to check up on her,
				you know... to see if she's better?

						CORNELIUS
				She's fine, really..don't you worry..
				just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

						KORBEN
				I know. I was there when she arrived.

	Cornelius is about to close the door.  Korben's hand blocks it.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something
				to me a while ago and... I don't really get it...
				Akta Gamat?

						CORNELIUS
				It means, "Never without my permission".

						KORBEN
				That's what I thought.

	Cornelius slams the door in his face.

						KORBEN
				...Thanks.

	Korben beads down the hallway. He passes his NEIGHBOR.

				Fuck you!

						KORBEN
				...Thanks... You, too.

	Korben enters his-apartment.

66B	INT.. KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door slides back and the cat comes rubbing up against him, tail in
the air.

						KORBEN
				Oh god. I forgot your food ... I'm really sorry!
				How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize?
				How does that sound, huh?

	The cat meows, appeased, just an the phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

						KORBEN
				Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way
				over but I had a fare fall into my lap..
				y'know one of those big fares you just
				can't resist..

						FINGER (V.O.)
					(suspicious)
				So, just how big was this fare?

						KORBEN
				5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin...

	Korben takes out a cigarette.

68	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo has a towel wrapped around her, it looks like she just took a
shower.  She sits  in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken.  Data
scrolls by on the screen.  David watches from the corner, in awe.

						DAVID
				What's she doing?

						CORNELIUS
				Learning our history!
				The last 5000 years that she missed!
				She's been out of circulation a while,
				you know.

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter.

						CORNELIUS
				What're you laughing about?

						LEELOO
					(pronouncing badly)
				Napoleon... small.

	She laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave.

						DAVID
					(hesitant)
				Uh father, I know she's been through a lot...
				but the sacred stones..we don't have much
				time..

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. Of course..

	Leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave.  A steaming plate heaped
with chicken and exotic vegetables.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo..I'm sorry to interrupt you but..

	She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her
second chicken.  Cornelius sits opposite her. and holds up the case
handle.

						CORNELIUS
					(serious)
				The case..with the stones...
				Where is it?

						LEELOO
				San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

						CORNELIUS
				The case was stolen?

	Leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food
in front of her.

	CLOSE ON: A pair of feet limping heavily.  A MAN comes alongside them.

						RIGHT ARM
				Excuse me sir, the council is worried about
				the economy heating up.  They wondered if
				it would be possible to fire 500...

	They reach a door at the end of the corridor.  Zorg enters a code.

						ZORG
				Fire 1000.

						RIGHT ARM
				But... 500 is all they need, sir.

	ZORG turns slowly.  A small scar across run across his face, his eye
stutters.
	This is not a man to cross, or contradict.

						RIGHT ARM
				1000! Fine, sir!
				Sorry to have disturbed you.

	The door opens...

	... and David enters carrying a bundle of clothes.

						CORNELIUS
				There was this guy with a limp who
				came a month ago..said he was an art
				dealer ... Asking all these questions about
				the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think
				anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so
				bad with names...

						DAVID
					(to Leeloo, timid)
				I didn't know your size.

	Leeloo is happy. She pulls off the towel and stands there nude. Cornelius
and David turn away.

						DAVID
				They really made her...

						CORNELIUS
				Perfect.

	Leeloo finishes dressing. She is delighted.

						LEELOO
					(to David)
				Domo danko!

	David smiles, dumb with admiration.  Cornelius comes over.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo?  The Stones...
				We must get them back.

	Leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on.

						LEELOO
				Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

						CORNELIUS
				You know exactly where they are!

71	INT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	A group of handsome WARRIORS approaches.  AKNOT, their leader has the
sacred case in his hands.  The metal handle is missing but the second
metal glove is still grasping the case.

						ZORG
					(pretending to be worried)
				Aknot?  Is that you?

	The LEADER nods. A disgusted look stamps Zorg's features.

						ZORG
				...What an ugly face! Doesn't suit you at all!
				Take it off...

	AKNOT's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous MANGALORE.

						ZORG
				That's better! Never be ashamed of
				who you are...
				You're warriors... be proud...

	AKNOT says nothing, but if his eyes could talk!

						ZORG
				So what if the Federal Army crushed your
				entire race and scattered your people to the
				wind...
				Your time for revenge is at hand...
				Voila... the ZF1.

	He takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch.

						ZORG
					(very fast)
				...It's light... the handle's adjustable for
				easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.

	Meanwhile, two MEN set up a mannequin rigged with various defense
mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse.

						ZORG
				... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by
				X-rays.. It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet
				interventions.  A word on fire power: Titanium
				recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300.
				With the replay button, another Zorg innovation,
				it's even easier... one shot.

	He fires at the mannequin.

						ZORG
				... and replay sends every following shot
				to the same location...

	Zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin.

						ZORG
					(even faster)
				I recharge, but the enemy has launched a
				cowardly sneak attack from behind, the
				automirror takes care of that.  Gives me the
				time to turn around and finish the job.
				300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies...

	He fires off each item he names.

						ZORG
				...Rocket launcher.  The always efficient
				flame thrower... My favorite.
				Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher,
				with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very
				practical.
				And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube
				system!

	The mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,.
stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid. He tosses the weapon into
AKNOT's hands.

						ZORG
				...Four full crates, delivered right on time!
				What about you, my dear Aknot, did
				you bring me what I asked you for?

	AKNOT sets the case on a crate.  Zorg gloats while stroking the case.

						ZORG
				...Magnificent.

	Zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case.  It's empty

72	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again.

						CORNELIUS
					(astonished)
				What do you mean empty?

73	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	AKNOT looks into the case.  Things grow tense.

						ZORG
				Alright..I've got an open mind here..
				anyone care to explain?

74	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo explains what happened in her language.

						CORNELIUS
					(translating)
				She says that the Guardians never really had
				much faith in humans. They were afraid of
				being attacked. The stones were given to someone
				they could trust who took another route.
				She's supposed to contact this person in a little less
				than twelve hours from now in a hotel.
				She's looking for the address!

	A map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points.

						LEELOO
				Dot!

	The little group comes over to look.

						DAVID
				Planet Fhloston, in the Angel constellation

	Cornelius plops down into his armchair.

						CORNELIUS
				...We're saved!

75	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

						ZORG
				I'm fucked!

	Zorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare.

						AKNOT
				You asked for a case.
				We brought you a case.

						ZORG
					(shouting)
				A case with four stones in it. Not one!
				Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!!
				What the fuck am I supposed to do with an
				EMPTY case?!!

AKNOT's men grow edgy.

						AKNOT
					(tense)
				...We are warriors, not merchants!

						ZORG
					(humored)
				But you can still count.  Look...
				my fingers.

	He holds up four fingers.

						ZORG
				...Four stones, four crates... Zero stones...
					(yelling)
				ZERO CRATES!!!
					(to his men)
				Put everything back, we're outta here.

	AKNOT's warriors turn their weapons on Zorg.

						AKNOT
					(icily)
				We risked our lives. I believe a
				little compensation is in order.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				So, you are a merchant, after all.
					(to his men)
				Leave them one crate.  For the cause!

	Zorg's men leave a crate and exit with the other three.

76	EXT.  OUTSIDE  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Zorg walks along the street to his limo.  RIGHT ARM carries the empty
case.

						ZORG
				I don't like warriors!  They're too
				narrow-minded, no sublety.  Worse,
				they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!
				Honor has killed millions of people but
				hasn't saved a single one.
					(pause)
				You know what -- do I like though, I like killer.
				  A real dyed in the wool killer.  Cold-blooded.
				Clean.  Methodical.  Thorough.  A killer, when
				he picked up the ZF1, would've immediately
				asked about the little red button on the bottom of
				the gun.

77	INT.  HALLWAY  ZORG'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

	The warriors have all taken a weapon. One of them inspects his ZF1.  He
turns it over and notices the little red button. He presses it.

	Korben is finishing a Thai meal, cooked by a Thai on his mini restaurant
anchored at the window. The cat eats next to Korben, contented.

						KORBEN
				So you forgive me?

	The cat meows just as a red light blinks, announcing the arrival of a
message in a glass tube.  Korben ignores it.

						THAI
				Not going to open?

						KORBEN
				I've never gotten a message that wasn't
				bad news.

						THAI
				How someone strong like you scared from
				a message? Is good news I sure!

						KORBEN
				The last two messages I got?  The first one
				was from my wife telling me she was leaving!
				And the second was from my lawyer telling me
				he was leaving too... with my wife.

						THAI
				You right that is bad.. but mathematically
				luck must change!
				Grandfather say: "It never rain every day."
				This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!

	Korben hesitates, then gives the envelope to the Thai, who opens it with
a big smile that fades as reads the contents aloud.

						THAI
				...You're fired. Oh!

	Korben smiles at him.

						KORBEN
				At least I won lunch.

						THAI
				Good philosophy..see good in bad..
				I like..I prepare number one dessert..
				special for you and pussy..

	The cat meows.

						CORNELIUS
				Good work, my son.  Now all we need is

	The doorbell rings.

				I'll get it.  Finish your work my son.

	Cornelius opens to Right Arm with armed escort.

						ZORG
				Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg...
				nice to see you again

						CORNELIUS
				I remember you now..the so called
				art dealer.

						ZORG
				I'm glad you got your memory back, Father...
				Because you're going to need it...
				Where are the stones?

						CORNELIUS
				...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

						ZORG
				Personally, they are of no interest to me,
				I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer...
				so tell me...

						CORNELIUS
				Even it I did know where the stones were
				I would never tell somebody like you.

						ZORG
				Why?  What's wrong with me?

						CORNELIUS
				...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life,
				All you want to do is destroy it.

						ZORG
				Ah, Father... You are so wrong.
				Let me explain...

	Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office.

						ZORG
				...would you like a drink?

						CORNELIUS
				No thank you.

						ZORG
				Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve,
				comes from destruction. Look at this empty
				glass.

	Zorg pushes the glass with his finger.

						ZORG
				Here it is... peaceful... serene...
				but if it is...

	Zorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor.

						ZORG
				Destroyed...

	Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping
out to clean up the mess.

						ZORG
				...Look at all these little things...
				so busy all of a sudden.
				Notice how each one is useful.
				What a lovely ballet, so full of form
				and color.  So full of..life!

						CORNELIUS
				They are robots!

	A SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry
into it.

						ZORG
				Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction.
				I gave work to at least fifty people today. The
				engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty
				people who will be able to feed their children so
				they can grow up big and strong.  Children who
				will have children of their own, adding to the great
				cycle of life!

	Cornelius sits in silence.

						ZORG
				Father, by creating a little destruction,
				I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in
				reality, you and I are in the same business!

						CORNELIUS
				Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people
				with the weapons you produce is quite another.

						ZORG
				Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill
				more people in my entire life than religion has
				killed in the last 2000 years.

	Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
	Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts
to panic.

						CORNELIUS
					(mocking)
				Where's the robot to pat your back?

	Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which
trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk.
True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat
multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He
licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around
the desk.  Zorg motions for help.

						CORNELIUS
				Can I give you a hand?

	Cornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg
regains control of himself. GUARDS come running in.

						ZORG
				You saved my life... So, I'm going
				to spare yours.
					(to the GUARDS)
				Throw him out!

	The GUARDS throw Cornelius out.

						CORNELIUS
				You are a monster, Zorg!

						ZORG
					(complimented)
				I know...

	The GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office.

						ZORG
				...Torture whoever you want, the
				president if you have to but I want
				those Stones. You have an hour.

phone rings.

				Hi Ma...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I've been playing twice a week for 20 years,
				20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

	Korben goes to light his cigarette.  There are only two matches left in
the match box.
	Korben strikes one and it fizzles.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You wouldn't even eat one to help your

				Know something? The whole thing makes

match..

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

						KORBEN

				Yes ma..

	Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box.

				...And now you're making fun of me?
				I'm warning you! If you don't take me

				in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab.
				I got mugged, but other than that
				everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!!
				Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

	A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You just won a trip, you dolt!
				Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

						KORBEN
				Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it.
				Someone would have notified me.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				They've been blaring out your name on
				the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

	He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.-

						KORBEN
				Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back.

	Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the
door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a
Captain and a Major.
	MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.
	Munro opens a file.

						MUNRO
					(clipped)
				Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct
				you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal
				Army on your enlistment which is more than
				you will need for a mission of the utmost
				importance.

						KORBEN
				What mission?

						MUNRO
				To save the world.

						KORBEN
				Where have I heard this song before?

						MUNRO
				You're to leave immediately for Fhloston
				Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the
				Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with
				the utmost discretion as possible.
				Any questions'?

						KORBEN
					(a little bewildered)
				Just one... why me?

						MUNRO
				Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite
				Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army
				you are an expert in the use of all weapons
				and spacecraft needed for this mission.

	Munro pulls out a long list of documents.

						MUNRO
				Two: Of all the members of your unit
				you were the most highly decorated.

						KORBEN
				And the third one?

						MUNRO
				You're the only one left alive...

	Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at.

						MUNRO
				Don't you open your messages?

						KORBEN
				I've had enough good news for today

						MUNRO
					(by rote)
				You have won the annual Gemini contest
				and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two.
				Congratulations.
				Here are your tickets.

	He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it.

						KORBEN
				You rigged the contest?

	Munro nods.

						MUNRO
				Major Iceborg will accompany you...
				as your wife...

	The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick.

						KORBEN
					(sarcastic)
				You couldn't come up with something
				a little more discreet?

						MUNRO
				Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

						KORBEN
				I'm not going.

						MUNRO
				Why not?

						KORBEN
				One reason... I want to stay the only
				one left alive.

110A	INT.  KORBEN'S  HALL

	Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the
card Korben gave her.  Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the.
number off the door.  He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell.

110B	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	The doorbell rings.

						KORBEN
				...Scuse me.

	Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo.
	Korben panics, overcome with happiness.

						KORBEN
				...Shit!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What is it?

	Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro.

						KORBEN
				It's my wife.

						MUNRO
				I thought you were divorced.

						KORBEN
				I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex..
				if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates
				you guys. It's what killed us in the first place.
				Please...

	He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's
hands.

						KORBEN
				...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice!
				It'll only take a minute! Let me set up
				another meeting and I'll be back.

						MUNRO
				Three of us will never fit in there!

						KORBEN
					(pushing him)
				Oh, yes you will...

	Korben slams the fridge door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				...Coming!

	He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying
about,
	shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his
hair back
	and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between
his
	eyes held by Cornelius.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				I suppose that means "Hi" ?

						CORNELIUS
				I'm sorry to have to resort to such
				methods, but we heard about your
				good luck on he radio and we need
				the tickets to Fhloston.

						KORBEN
				Is that the usual way priests go on
				vacation?

						CORNELIUS
				We're not going on vacation..we're
				on a mission..

						KORBEN
				What kind of mission?

						CORNELIUS
					(sincere)
				We have to save the world.

						KORBEN
					(skeptical)
				Good luck..

						CORNELIUS
				Of course.

						KORBEN
				Father, I was in the Army for awhile
				and every time they told us we were
				on a mission to save the world the
				only thing that changed was I lost a
				lot of friends. So thanks for the offer..
				but no thanks.

	Cornelius is disappointed.  Leeloo looks crestfallen.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry..

						VOICE
				This is a police control action..

	Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic
voice.

111	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING

	A group of POLICEMEN bursts into the hallway.  One of the cops enters a
code on the police wall box.  A device descends from the ceiling, a
flashing light-siren,
	a VOICE fills the air.

						VOICE
				This is not an exercise.
				This is a police control.

	Cornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge.

						CORNELIUS
				Oh my god oh my god..

	Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower
takes it's place.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, hide in here and don't move!

	Leeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed.

						CORNELIUS
				What are you doing?

						KORBEN
				Trying to save your ass so you can
				save the world.

	..and hits a button on the wall.  The bed disappears into the wall.

	Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt.

112	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues.

						VOICE
				...Spread your legs and place your
				hands in the yellow circles, please.

	A COP slaps a viewer device on Korben's door which makes part of it
transparent.

						COP 1
				Put your hands in the yellow circles,
				please.

	Korben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He's
looking for
	a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair
and beard.

						COP 1
					(to COP 2)
				Sir? Are you a human?

						KORBEN
				No, I'm a meat popsicle.

						COP 3
					(at the other end of the hall)
				I found him!

	C.U. Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the
neighbor's apartment.  COP 3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor's door.
The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall, COP 1
arrives with Korben's picture.

						COP 1
				Sir, this is a control.  Please put your
				hands in the yellow circles.

	The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He
could pass for Korben.

						NEIGHBOR
				Fuck you!!

113	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben still has his hands to the wall.

						KORBEN
				Wrong answer.

	SHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle.

114	INT.  HALL

	The riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in
a canvas bag.  A cop is on the wall phone.

						COP
				OK, we got the guy under wraps.

115	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Right Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg.

						COP (O.S.)
				It was not easy, but we bagged him!.
				Thanks for the tip!

						RIGHT ARM
					(smiling)
				Glad to help.

	He hangs up.

						RIGHT ARM
				They just arrested the guy for Uranium
				smuggling. Everything's going as planned.

	He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's
name.

						RIGHT ARM
				All I have to do now is to go to the
				airport and take his place.  I should be
				in Fhloston in less than four hours.

	Zorg sits there quietly for a moment.

						ZORG
				Don't come back without the Stones.

116	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth
chattering from the cold.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.

His eyes fall on an old blanket.

						KORBEN
				Here let me wrap you up.

	Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.

						KORBEN
			..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and
			you've ended up in my arms both times.

	Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.
	She recovers, looking embarrassed too.

						LEELOO
					(nicely)
				Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

						KORBEN
				Uh..you're welcome.

	The intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion.

						KORBEN
				Coffee!  That's what you need!
				A nice, hot cup of coffee!

	He pushes a button on the coffee machine.

						KORBEN
				With some honey!  You'll see, honey's
				great!...

	Korben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to
quite understand everything that is going on.

						KORBEN
				A hot cup of coffee... with honey...

	He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and
begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon..

						KORBEN
					(nervously)
				I've got this great honey somewhere.
				You know about honey?  There used to be
				these little animals who made it with antenna...

	..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero.

						KORBEN
				..and these other animals who ate it..
				one were bees the other were bears..

	She looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

						KORBEN
				I forget which ate it and which made it
				but..

	And she smiles.

						KORBEN
				Here it is!

	Korben holds up the jar of honey.

						KORBEN
				Taste this...

	Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

						KORBEN
				It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

	She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

	An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.

						KORBEN
				You hear that?

						LEELOO
					(licking)
				Cornelius..

						KORBEN
				Oh god!

	Korben pushes the button on the wall.  The bed pops out, fully made, with
Cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. let me help you..

Korben begins to pull at the covers when..

						LEELOO
				Achta ge lumitai de matala..

	Korben turns..

						KORBEN
				What?

	He turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. His breath is taken
away by the sight of her perfect body.

	Cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  Korben drops to
the floor.

						LEELOO
					(displeased)
				Vano da, mechteba?!
				Soun domo kala chon hammas!

						CORNELIUS
				No, I'm not proud of myself...
				But we don't have the luxury of choice.

117	INT.  ENTRANCE  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	The POLICE exit the elevator and head for the front door.  A cop suddenly
takes a hit from a silencer, then a second. Others are bashed on the head
by MANGALORE warriors.  One of them picks up the prisoner bag, takes it
into a small shed.

118	INT.  SHED

	Aknot, the Mangalore leader, is seriously wounded and can't walk.

						AKANIT
				Korben Dallas!  We got him.

						AKNOT
				Perfect... Take command, Akanit.
				Go to Fhloston and get the Stones...
				If Zorg really wants them... He'll have
				to negotiate.  Revenge is at hand.

119	INT.  KORBEN'S APARTMENT  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Korben gets unsteadily to his feet, some blood drips down his face. He
daubs at it.

						KORBEN
				Jesus!... Some priest!

	The phone rings, he manages to answer.

						KORBEN
				Yeah?

						MOTHER (V.O)
				Have you pulled yourself together?

						KORBEN
				...Not yet.

	He hangs up.

	Korben opens the fridge door.  The three officers are frozen solid.
Korben grabs some ice, presses it to his forehead.

						KORBEN
				I'll take the mission.

	He closes the door.

120	INT. AIRPORT  HALL - DAY

	Cornelius and Leeloo (still damp) arrive at the Manhattan Intergalactic
Airport.
	A huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

	There are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash
holding picket signs.  A SECURITY GUARD picks up a phone off the wall.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Illegal gathering in Zone 4.

	A hand taps Leeloo from behind.  She whips around catching David in the
face.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo, be careful.

	He turns to David who in holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				Did you get them?

	David hands Cornelius two passports.

						CORNELIUS
				Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.

	He hands it to her.  The name makes her smile.

						CORNELIUS
				And Korben David Dallas.

	She frowns.

						LEELOO
				Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

						CORNELIUS
				I can't pretend to be your husband...
				David's in great shape.

	She looks at David holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				He'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva...
				get the Stones... See you at the temple...
				God be with you.

	ANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he
scopes the hall looking for Leeloo. A POLICE PATROL bearing down on the
STRIKERS jostles him. The cops open fire.  The strikers dive into the garbage
and disappear.

121	INT.  BOARDING  GATE

	David nervously puts tickets and IDs on the check-in counter.
	Leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				Congratulations on winning the contest.

	David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes.

	Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for
them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's
seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back.

						KORBEN
					(friendly)
				Hey! I really thought I was going to
				miss my flight!
					(to David)
				Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on
				the conveyor belt?

						DAVID
					(freaking)
				Uh... yeah.

						KORBEN
					(smiling)
				Great! Now beat it!

	Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the
				flight that I sent the kid here to pick up
				my boarding card.

	He looks at David's fake ID.

						KORBEN
				...My cousin David...

	Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(looking at Leeloo's ID)
				Your wife?

	Korben grabs the ID and reads it.

						KORBEN
				Uh, yes... Newlyweds.
					(aside)
				You know how it is... Love at first sight.
				You meet, something goes tilt,. you get
				married, you hardly know each other.
				Right, darling?

	Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand.

						LEELOO
					(sharply)
				Dinoine chagantakat!

						KORBEN
				Took the words right out of my mouth.
				Go on... I'll be right with you.
					(to Check-in Attendant)
				It's our honeymoon. We're going to use
				the trip to get to know each other better.

	He winks at the stewardess.

	ANGLE ON:

	The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in
almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a
stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol
isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared.

						COP
					(to pig)

				Come on, snyffer, go root!

	The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack.
	Cornelius sits at a bar.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the bartender)
				I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty
				work. I know she was made to be strong
				but she's also so fragile... So human.
				You know what I mean?

	The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink.

	ANGLE ON:

	The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in
attendant.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(surprised)
				Dallas... Korben...

						NEIGHBOR
					(in a different voice)
				Yes, that's me.

	The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on
their faces, revealing two other faces:

	Mangalores.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				Just a minute, please.

	She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong.

						NEIGHBOR
				We'll be right back ... we're gonna
				check out the duty free...

	They spin around and hurry away.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag.

						ROBOT
				The same?

						CORNELIUS
				Yeah...

						DAVID (V.O.)
				Make that two...

	Cornelius turns to David.

						CORNELIUS
				Where's Leeloo?

						DAVID
				On the plane... with Mr. Dallas...
				the real one.

						CORNELIUS
				It's all my fault.  I'm the servant...
				It's my mission! Here!

	He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck.

						CORNELIUS
				Here's the key to the Temple..
				Prepare for our arrival!

	Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot,
and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are
very nervous.
	A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them.

						NEIGHBOR
					(to the tawdry girl)
				Tell Aknot plan A flopped.
				Tell him to go to plan B.

	The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and
blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the
hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears.

						COP
					(into walkie-talkie)
				...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7!

	ANGLE ON:

	On one side of the hall, a trap door opens. Three pigs come running out,
grabbed by their police handler.

	Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and
crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs.

122	INT.  FIRST  CLASS  LOUNGE

	Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything
in sight.

123	INT.  HALL

	Korben is led down the hall by a STEWARDESS.

						STEWARDESS
				You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the
				coolest DJ in the universe.

						KORBEN
				Listen... I don't want to be interviewed.
				I'd prefer to remain anonymous.

	The stewardess stops in the corridor.

						STEWARDESS
				Forget anonymous.  You'll be doing Loc
				Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!

						KORBEN
					(expression changes)
				You gotta be kidding!

	The stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  The door next to him suddenly
swings open and smashes him in the face.

	In walks LOC RHOD amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  He is
young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox.  A
bundle of energy.  He is the 24th century's most popular DJ.

						LOC RHOD
					(speedy, in rhythm)
				Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated
				man in the universe. The one and only winner
				of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start
				melting 'cause the boy's hot! Hot! Hot! The boy
				is perfect..
					(he feels his muscles)
				...The right size, right build, right hair.  Right on!
				Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out
				there D-man!

	An ASSISTANT hands a totally lost Korben a mike.

						KORBEN
					(hesitant)
				...Hi.

						LOC RHOD
				Does it get any better or what!

	Loc Rhod grabs Korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as
the music.

						LOC RHOD
				...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on
				fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know
				everything there is to know about the D-man.
				His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of
				intimates.  And from what I'm looking at
				intimate is the stud muffin's middle name.
				So tell me my main man... you nervous in the
				service?

						KORBEN
				Uh... not really.

	Loc Rhod lets go of Korben's arm and grabs the Stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause
				Korben is on the case with a major face...

	Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a
				sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your
				every desire.

	They come to an intersection.  The airline company has prepared drinks
for them.  Loc Rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his
autograph.

						LOC RHOD
				Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince
				of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and
				one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  A magic
				fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and
				Bootchie Koochie Koo...

	He tosses away his champagne glass.

						LOC RHOD
				Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on
				the prowl. Owwww!

	Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm.

						LOC RHOD
				...And start licking your stamps little girls,
				this guy's gonna have you writing home to
				Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I'll be your
				voice, your tongue and I'll be hot on the tail
				of the sexiest man of the year... D-man...
				Your man... My man.

	The stewardess shivers.  A BEEP is heard.

						VOCODER (O.S.)
				End of transmission.

	The MUSIC suddenly stops.  Several assistants come and compliment Loc
Rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this
				is probably the biggest thing that ever happened
				to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got
				a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow,
				when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make
				believe you have more than a one word vocabulary.
				OK pal?

	That does it.  Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a
corner.
	Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground.

						KORBEN
					(pissed)
				I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio.
				So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a
				hand, that clear pal?

						LOC RHOD
					(petrified)
				Crystal.

124	INT.  AIRPORT

	The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(alter a moment, reading)
				...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas?

	Zorg's Right Arm gives her a big smile.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's right.

	The attendant scans the ID with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the
blue light reveals no other face but his.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on
				my list... and he's already checked in.

	Right Arm's smile shatters.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's impossible!  He's in j... I mean, there
				must be some mistake. I have my ticket!
				I'm the real Korben Dallas!

	A shrill BELL rings out.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				I'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished.

	The attendant hits a button.  A thick window slowly slides up between
them.
	Right Arm totally loses it.

						RIGHT ARM
				I want to see your boss!  Get rid of this
				fucking window! Somebody's made a
				mistake, goddamnit!

	He pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down.
Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from
the wall, all aimed at him.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is not an exercise.  This is a police
				control.
				Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...

						RIGHT ARM
					(slowing down)
				Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited...
				that's all... I'm calm now.

125	INT.  SHUTTLE - DAY

	Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in
modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  He
passes STEWARD holding his bloodied nose. He has found what he is looking
for. He enters to.... Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer
screen.  Korben slips in beside her.  Leeloo in concentrating on the words
that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  He doesn't understand what she
is doing.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				Not hard to find you...just follow the
				Chaos...

	Leeloo smiles, as if complimented.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets...
				they're not mine... I mean they are, but
				not for vacation like everyone thinks...
				I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come
				get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble...
				I'd love to be on vacation with you...
				but now.... now I've got to work...
				And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.

	Leeloo types in "LOVE" on the keyboard.

						LEELOO
				Love...

						KORBEN
				Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word
				here, PEACE is!

	Leeloo types in this new word.

						LEELOO
					(rather pleased)
				Peace... and love...

	She brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign.
Korben sighs and switches off the screen.

						KORBEN
				Sometimes you can't learn everything
				from a screen..sometimes it's better to
				ask someone who has experience..

						LEELOO
					(quite happy)
				What is... Make Love?

	Korben just stares at her for a few minutes.

						KORBEN
				Know what? On that subject maybe you'd
				be better off asking the screen.

	He turns the computer back on.

	ANGLE ON:

	A STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on
top of each individual box.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				...to make your flight as short and agreeable
				as possible, our flight attendants are switching
				on the timing sleeper which will regulate your
				sleep during the trip...

	ANGLE ON:

						LEELOO
					(switching off the screen)
				OK! Finished!

						KORBEN
				Finished what?

						LEELOO
				Learning language.

						KORBEN
				Which one?

						LEELOO
				All 900.

	Korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not.

						KORBEN
				You learned 900 languages in five
				minutes?!

						LEELOO
					(pleased)
				Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your
				language, you have to learn mine!

						KORBEN
				I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how
				to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.

						LEELOO
				Apipoussan!

						KORBEN
				Apipoussan?

						LEELOO
				Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?

						KORBEN
					(fumbling)
				Uh...

						LEELOO
				...Hoppi-hoppa.

	Korben literally melts.

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				Help...

	Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window.

						STEWARDESS
				Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas!

	The stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately
fall asleep.

	A STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem.

						STEWARDESS 2
				Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume
				your individual position.

						LOC RHOD
					(hugging her)
				I don't want an individual position,
				I want all positions!

						STEWARDESS 2
					(resisting somewhat)
				We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod!

						LOC RHOD
				Now you're talking!

126	INT.  COCKPIT  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	Three CREW MEMBERS prepare for liftoff.

	Stewardess 1 enters the cockpit.

						STEWARDESS 1
				Zone 1. 217 locked. The sleep regulator is OK.

						PILOT
					(checking her out)
				Thanks, Miss.

	The Stewardess leaves with a smile.  A red light flashes on the vast
control panel.

						MECHANIC
				Tell the ground crew we've got parasites
				in the landing gear.

127	INT.  AIRPORT  LANDING  STRIP - DAY

	A GROUND CREW MEMBER goes over to the truck parked under one of the
plane's wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				Disinfecting!

	Two DISINFECTORS in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck.  They go
over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam.  The flame
burns everything it touches.  A pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing
from the landing gear.  A small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a
huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out.

128	INT.  AIRPORT  HALL / ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Zorg's Right Arm is in a phone booth in the middle of the hall.

						RIGHT ARM
				Yeah, it's me... Put Zorg on.

	He is already sweating.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				I'm listening.

						RIGHT ARM
				The real Korben Dallas is on the plane!
				He took my place.

						ZORG
				This is a joke, right?

129	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Loc Rhod is wrapped around a stewardess like a snake.

						LOC RHOD
				No!! I swear to God! I've never been this
				sincere with a human before!

130 EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	TWO GROUND CREW MEMBERS stick an enormous, highly phosphorescant tube
	into the opening.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				You're fueled and ready to go.
				Have a nice flight.

131	INT.  SHUTTLE

						PILOT
					(to copilot)
				Everything ready for liftoff?

132	INT.  CABIN

						STEWARDESS

				No, no... I'm not ready! I'd like to talk first...

133	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE / AIRPORT  HALL

						ZORG
				I cannot hear you. We have a bad
				connection here.  What's your number?

	Right Arm reads off the phone number.

						RIGHT ARM
				278-500-645-321

						ZORG
				I'll call you back.

134  EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	The runway is now empty. A man slips out of the shadows. It's Cornelius.
He scurries over to the front landing gear. He pauses for an instant, the
climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle.

135	INT.  SHUTTLE

	The pilots are going through the pre-flight check list.

						COPILOT
				Anti static pressure?

						MECHANIC
				Primed.

	The mechanic presses a series of buttons.

136	INT.  CABIN

	Loc Rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess' blouse, behind a
curtain. He whispers a poem.  Impossible to resist him. Outside the
curtain the stewardess' legs rise slowly.

137	EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	On the ground, protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine
exhaust on liftoff.

138	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	A keyboard slowly appears in front of Zorg.

						ZORG
					(typing the number)
				278... 500...

139	SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

	The pilot gradually turns the engines up.

						COPILOT
				10 seconds...

						PILOT
				Power increase.

	- The stewardess undergoes a power surge from Loc Rhod that's about to
lift her of.

	- Zorg finishes gleefully typing in the number.

						ZORG
				3... 2... 1...

	- The engines at full blast.

	- The stewardess in close to screaming.

						PILOT
				Liftoff.

	- The copilot pushes a button.

	- So does Zorg.

	- The engines release their full power.

	- The stewardess screams in ecstasy.

	- In the hall, Right Arm literally explodes along with the phone and
everything else   within 60 feet.

140	INT.  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	The stewardess' legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain.

141	INT.  COCKPIT

	In the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up.

						COPILOT
					(relaxing)
				Landing gear secure.  Let's light one up.

142	INT.  CABIN

	Korben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box.  Leeloo has a smile on her
face and her hand in Korben's.

143	EXT.  OUTERSPACE - NIGHT

	The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed.
Space is now empty and calm.  Billions of stars glow in perfect silence.


144	EXT.  SPACE

	The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing
like a serpent.  Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops
and it becomes gray and cold.

145	INT.  SPACESHIP

	In the Admiral's starship, scientists watch the measuring device.  One of
the devices suddenly starts working.

						TECHNICIAN
				All right! We're finally getting something!

146	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired
than ever.

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				The thing is sending out radio wavelengths!

						PRESIDENT
				What the hell does it want with radio waves?

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				...Probably wants to make a call!

	The President and his Generals look at him in astonishment.

147	INT.  ZORG'S OFFICE

	Picasso purrs contentedly on Zorg's lap.  The phone rings.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Mr. Shadow on the line.

	Zorg shoots to his feet.  Picasso tumbles to the floor.  Zorg picks up
the phone, both excited and uneasy. He stands there, almost coming to
attention.

						ZORG
				Yes... Zorg here.

	The voice is feeble.  It comes from the far reaches of time, from the
bowels of the universe.

						SHADOW
				Am I disturbing you?

						ZORG
				No... not at all.  Where are you?

	SHADOW'S breathing is awesome.

						SHADOW
				...Not far, now.

						ZORG
				Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen
				and see you at last!

	Zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons.

	In the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human,
quiverinq form appears. Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is.
Zorg feels sick.

						SHADOW
				Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

						ZORG
				Got it.

						SHADOW
				How's our deal coming along?

						ZORG
					(ill at ease)
				Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you
				asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy.
				My costs have tripled.

	Shadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the
top of the screen.  Zorg is feeling worse all the time.

						SHADOW
				Money is of no importance...
				I want the Stones!

	The black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt.  Zorg
sweats profusely,  his legs tremble.

						ZORG
				The Stones will be here. I'll see to it
				personally!

						SHADOW
				...I can't wait to be among you.

	Zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked.

148	EXT. ORBIT  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The space shuttle fills the screen.  It banks left and begins its descent
toward Fhloston, the turquoise planet.  Crystal blue water, perfect white sand
beaches.  A true paradise.

149	INT.  SPACE SHUTTLE

	The stewardess picks up a microphone to make an announcement.

						STEWARDESS
				Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our
				descent toward Fhloston Paradise...

	Stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one. They
press a button on the door of each box.

	In the corner, Loc Rhod and the stewardess awake with a start and
straighten their clothes quickly.  The stewardess is embarrassed.

						STEWARDESS
					(timidly)
				I wanted to tell you that...

	Loc Rhod puts on his sunglasses and presses a finger to her lips.  He
disappears behind the curtain leaving the sighing stewardess on her own.

150	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast
turquoise sea.  Fhloston Paradise looms into view.  An enormous oceanliner
floating a dozen yards above the water.  On closer inspection it is more
modern than a traditional oceanliner.  The shuttle draws near, looking
ridiculously small next to the monster.  Like a sardine next to a whale.

151	INT.  COCKPIT

	A blinking light goes on.

						PILOT
				Shit! Parasites in Zone 1. Take a look.

	The 1st Mate heads off.

152	INT.  CABIN

	A stewardess opens Korben's box door.  He is still heavy with sleep. He
looks over at Leeloo.  She's not there.

153	EXT.  FHLOSTON

	The tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner.

154	INT.  COCKPIT

	The Pilot maneuvers the ship into it's docking area.

						PILOT
				Docking activated.
				You can let the passengers out.

155	INT.  REAR  OF  COCKPIT

	The 1st mate pries open the door to an overhead panel.  Cornelius falls
out, hanging in a jumble of wires.

156.	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	The enormous door opens and the passengers exit.  Leeloo is among them.
She appears quite impressed by the beauty and luxury of the 19th century
decoration.

157	INT.  CABIN

	Korben attempts to make his way up the shuttle's aisle.

						KORBEN
					(jostling everybody)
				Pardon me.  Excuse me. I'm trying to
				reach my wife.. Sorry!

158	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL

	A dozen policemen wait patiently at the end of the hall.  Leeloo stops
and presses against the wall.  She spots Korben leaving the shuttle.  A
gorgeous HOSTESS comes up to him, drapes a lei around his neck and plants a
kiss on his lips in welcome.

						HOSTESS
					(smiling)
				Welcome to Paradise.

	Korben's face is covered in lipstick.  Leeloo sees he did nothing to stop
the girl and she doesn't like it.

	A HEFTY MAN wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck.  Then,
	obviously relishing it, he leans down to kiss her.  Leeloo bashes him on
the forehead.  The hefty man straightens up.  He's still smiling, but his
nose is bleeding. He falls slowly to the floor.

	Korben pushes forward trying to spot Leeloo.  He also tries to wipe the
lipstick off.  Leeloo tries to escape through a door marked PERSONNEL ONLY,
but it's locked.  A HOST looks at her with a grin.

						HOST
					(playful)
				If you don't have the code you can't
				open it!

	Leeloo smiles and punches in an old code and twists the doorknob.  The
door opens with the sound of a braking lock.  Leeloo smiles sweetly and enters
as if nothing were amiss.

	A shriek of joy fills the room.  Korben turns around.  The HOSTESSES
cluster around Loc Rhod as he comes out of the plane.  Loc Rhod spots Korben
and latches onto his arm.  It's not going to be easy to remain discrete.

						LOC RHOD
					(relieved)
				My main man! Please don't leave me here
				alone. My head's killing me and my adoring
				fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta
				here!

						KORBEN
				I'll take you to the bar, after that,
				you're on your own.

						LOC RHOD
					(hanging on to Korben)
				Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right,
				man. Tell me all about yourself, your
				roots, your personal life, your childhood
				dreams...

						KORBEN
				I don't think this is a good time...

						LOC RHOD
				...You got brothers and sisters? What
				about your dad? Tell me about your
				dad! What was he like? Physically?
				Big, I suppose?

						KORBEN
					(evasive)
				Yeah, very big, a giant.

						LOC RHOD
				I didn't have a dad... never saw him...
				never even heard him. 50 billion people
				listen to me every day... and he doesn't
				hear me...

159	INT.  SMALL  ROOM  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening. Everything seems
normal. She turns and discovers the room for what it is:	a rest room
for... three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her.
Leeloo doesn't know what to do. So she smiles.

	The door opens.  The HOSTESS turns on the light and enters.  Korben
follows her, gaping at all the luxury.

	The BAGGAGE BOY enters bringing Leeloo's two suitcases.

	Korben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in
that evening.  Dress: Formal attire.

						KORBEN
				For the concert it says formal attire...
				I didn't bring...

	The hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row.

						HOSTESS
					(looking him over)
				Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after
				the concert to open it.

	She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door.

	Korben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular
view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity.
Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of
his reverie.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				You little sleaze bag!

						KORBEN
				...Ma???

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				Don't you ever ask me for another thing
				in my life again, you've killed your
				poor mother with your own hands!

	Korben drops into an armchair and sighs. His eyes go to the ceiling.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				I want maximum security.

						FOG
				Yes. Sir!

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(to Cornelius)
				OK, let's hear it.

						CORNELIUS
				Where was I?

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(bored)
				...You open the door. There's a cabby with
				a girl in his arms.

	FOG opens the door.  Two COPS come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged.
They hold up a THIRD COP.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				What happened?
				A bomb go off in your face?

						BEAT-UP COP
				Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb...
				with green eyes.

	Cornelius perks up.

						CORNELIUS
				And the smile of an angel?

	They all turn to look at him.

						CORNELIUS
					(to Chief)
				May I speak to you alone.

167	INT.  CORRIDOR  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear
the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of
	PORTERS carrying trunks.

	Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a
painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face
of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and
strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy.
The Diva's ASSISTANT comes up to her.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
				Please forgive this little incident. She wants
				you to know that she senses great powers in
				you... in the service of a noble cause... She
				will give you what you have come to get, but
				she wants to sing first...
				One last time...

	The Diva's assistant turns the painting right side up.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
					(nodding)
				Miss.

	Leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better.

168	EXT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Policemen stand at attention in front of the Diva's suite.

						FOG
				Hello, I'm head of security.
				Everything is in order. You can...

	The Diva enters her suite without letting him finish.

						FOG
				...make yourselves at home safely.
				If you need anything...give it a knock!

169	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A door opens near the police officer's main entrance. Cornelius looks
both ways. Then crosses the hall, dragging the Chief of Police by the feet.

170	INT.  KORBEN'S  STATEROOM

	Korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone.

						KORBEN
				Listen, Ma! I've only got a few days
				vacation and I'll be damned if I'm
				gonna spend them on the phone.

	The door RINGS.

						KORBEN
				...Hang on, it's the door. No!
				I told you I didn't bring anybody!
				I'm all alone... as usual!

	Korben opens the door.  It's not the champagne.  Even better. It's
Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(to his mother)
				...I'll call you back.

	Leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  Korben has to
turn away once more.

						KORBEN
				Here we go again...

						LEELOO
					(by rote)
				You know women normally change five
				times more than men.

						KORBEN
				You get that off the screen?

						LEELOO
				Yes... you know there's a lot of
				differences between men women.

						KORBEN
				You noticed..

						LEELOO
				OK, you can turn around!

	Korben turns around.  Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy
to the max.  He is smitten.  So much so that Leeloo wonders if something
isn't quite right.

						KORBEN
				Where you going?

						LEELOO
				I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's
				the matter?... Do I look bad?

						KORBEN
				No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite,
				you're... you're beautiful!

	Leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  She turns, revealing
her unzippered back.  Korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh.  Her
perfect bottom.

						LEELOO
				Do you know how this works?

	Korben's blood boils.  She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to
the zipper.

						KORBEN
				I have an idea.

	But instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  A
flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going
from the floor to the ceiling.
	Stunned, Leeloo is held captive.

						KORBEN
				I told you I need to work in peace.
				Remember? I need to concentrate.

						LEELOO
				And you can't concentrate with me
				around?.

						KORBEN
				It's difficult.

	She tries to breakout.

						KORBEN
				Army issue. I'm sorry.

	Leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. Impossible.

	Korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.
	Leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.

						LEELOO
					(seething)
				You're nothing but a... a...

						KORBEN
				The words you're looking for weren't
				in the dictionary you studied. I won't
				be long.

	The door flies open.  Loc Rhod barges in.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey Stud we gotta...

	Then he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  His mind goes
to the obvious.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben my man what's happening here?
				Who's the chick? What's the gig?
				We free forming here? Getting funky
				with the monkey? Can I get in on this?

	Korben grabs him by the collar..

						KORBEN
				No..to all of the above.

	And yanks Loc Rhod out of the room.  Leaving Leeloo looking extremely
unhappy.

Opera in Paris.  A hostess escorts them to their seats.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting)
				We have just walked into what is probably
				the most beautiful concert hall in the universe.
				Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the
				ceiling. I don't know who painted them, but he
				must have busted his balls! I see a row of former
				ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals
				practicing how to sleep. And there's Baby Ray, star
				of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets.
				He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's
				stone-deaf!

	ANGLE ON:

	Baby Ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph.

						BABY RAY
				...to who?

						LOC RHOD
					(moving down the aisle)
				...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king
				of laserball and the best paid player in the League.
					(shakes hands as he goes by)
				...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet
				whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar.
				"I love to sing, too, but in the shower", she
				recently confessed to me. She will no doubt
				prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.

	A waiter gives them two glasses of champagne.  Track with the WAITER an
he leaves the hall with his empty tray.  He enters a small room reserved for
staff.

177	INT.  STAFF  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The waiter joins some other WAITERS.  They are well armed.  He opens a
cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon. Suddenly their faces burn off
revealing AKANIT, the young leader of the Mangalores, and his troops.

						AKANIT
				It's showtime!

Speakers appear.

	Leeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert.

181	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown,
stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  Behind her, a star filled
window.  The MUSIC begins.  The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien.
And then she begins to sing.  Her voice is divine, unmatched.  Korben is
swept up in the TEARS.

182	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes

183	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The manager couldn't care less about the concert.  His main problem is
the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open.  The doorbell RINGS.

						MANAGER
					(ugly mood)
				Yeah!?

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Flowers for the Diva.

						MANAGER
				She's allergic to flowers!!!

						VOICE (O.S.)
				There's champagne as well...

	The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. A dozen Mangalores rush
in. One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius watching from around the corner.

						CORNELIUS

	FLASHBACK:

	The same ships with Mangalores at the controls attack the Mondoshawans at
the beginning of our story.

188	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam
with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough
for her to escape.

189	INT.  CLOSET  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and
gagged in.  He quickly unties him.

						CORNELIUS
					(in a panic)
				Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want
				the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped.
				We must stop them!. I'm going to free you
				but you must promise to help me!

	The Chief of Police nods his agreement.

190	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The Mangalores have trashed the suite.  One of the Mangalores finally
finds a case engraved with the four elements.

						MANGALORE
				I have it.

	The Mangalore is about to open the case when... Leeloo descends quietly
and gracefully from the ceiling.  Time stands still.

						LEELOO
				(smiling)
			Apipoulai!

191	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	The Diva switches from classical music to funk, picking up the tempo.

	INTERCUT':

192	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL.

	A WARRIOR whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes Leeloo.  She
disarms him gracefully.  A violent fight breaks out.  The Diva sings and
Leeloo dances.  The Mangalores pay a heavy price for the show.

193	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Hearing noise from inside the suite, the Mangalore by the door gets
nervous.  He runs for reinforcements.

194	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Cornelius enters the police station wearing handcuffs.  The Chief of
Police is behind him holding a gun.

195	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL

	Leeloo knocks out the last Mangalore just as the Diva finishes her song
to a burst of applause.  The Diva takes a bow.   So does Leeloo.

196	INT.  ROOM

	Akanit and his men listen to the concert. The Mangalore guard runs in.

						MANGALORE
				They were waiting for us! It was an
				ambush!

						AKANIT
				If it's war they want it's war they'll get!
				Enact the Final Plan!

	All the Mangalores cock their weapons.

197	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is about to open the case when the door EXPLODES.  Zorg is there
holding a ZF1.

						ZORG
				My compliments, little lady!
				...And thanks for doing all the dirty work!
				I couldn't have done it any better myself!
					(sharply)
				...Now hand over the Stones!

	Leeloo smiles and hands him the case.  Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready
to kill her.

						ZORG
				Nice knowing you.

	Leeloo catches on quickly.  She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into
the gun which throws Zorg's shot off.  She jumps to the ceiling and
disappears in an air vent.  Furious, Zorg fires at the ceiling.

198	INT.	AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

199	INT.  SUITE

	Zorg fires his 3000 round clip.  The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss
cheese.  Zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on.  The
numbers flashing by tell us it's a bomb.  The timer reads: 19 minutes and 59
seconds.

						ZORG
					(with a crafty smile)
				You can run but you can't hide...

200	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	Cornelius is seated opposite the Chief of Police.  A MEDIC is bandaging
the chief's head.  The door explodes.  The cop outside in riddled with
bullets.  A dozen Mangalores attack the police office.  Akanit is at
their head.  The policemen are caught unaware.

						AKANIT
				Nobody move! We're taking over this
				ship!

	The Chief of Police is goggle-eyed.  Cornelius leans toward him.

						CORNELIUS
					(pleased with himself)
				I told you...

201	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off.
	He sighs in exasperation.

202	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Three Mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting.

						MANGALORE 1
				Everyone down!

	There is panic all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting, panic stricken)
				Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're being...
				attacked.  The place is crawling with warriors.

203	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg and his generals look very worried.

204	INT.  CONCERT HALL

	Some security guards open fire one of the Mangalores is hit.  The others
turn their guns on the cops.  People scream, diving for cover.  Korben bides
his time.

	More Mangalores rush in from all around shooting.  Two cops are killed.
	The Diva... takes a bullet.

	She falls from the stage into Korben's arms. He lowers her to the floor.
Korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket,
trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds.

205	EXT./ INT.  SPACE  AROUND  FHLOSTON

	Zorg's ZFX200 speeds away from the boat.  Zorg is at the controls, a
devilish smile on his lips.

						ZORG
				You want something done, do it yourself!

206	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Fighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to
it.  He sets the Diva's head delicately on the floor.  Loc Rhod is hidden
nearby, still on the air.

						LOC RHOD
					(voice low, panicked)
				They're hideous. They've got a crest on
				the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers
				all over their hands. Totally hideous!

207	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE.

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				...Mangalores!

						PRESIDENT
				Send a battalion out immediately!

208	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
					(to the Diva)
				I was sent by the government to help you.

						DIVA
				Don't worry.  This is my fate...
				How was the concert?

	Korben is a little surprised, but... the Diva is an artist.

						KORBEN
				I've never heard anything so beautiful
				in my life.

	A Mangalore jumps on them from the stage.  Korben makes short work of him
and grabs his gun.

						DIVA
					(weak)
				You're a good man...
				She was right to have chosen you...

						KORBEN
				Who?

						DIVA
				The Fifth Element...
				The Supreme Being... Your wife...

	Korben is floored.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo... is... she's...

						DIVA
				Yes, and more than that... You must
				give her the Stones, she's the only one
				who knows how to use them.

						KORBEN
					(to himself, suddenly
					realizing)
				...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

209	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	The Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the Chief of Police)
				Of course I was telling you the truth!...
				If you had listened to me in the first place,
				we wouldn't be in this predicament now!

210	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben wastes two more Mangalores.

						DIVA
				She needs you. She needs your help and
				your love. She's more fragile than she seems...

	Korben looks around, ready for another attack.

						KORBEN
				...Yeah, so am I.

	The Diva takes his hand.

						DIVA
				She was taught to love the life of others...
				but not her own. You have to teach her
				to love if you want her to truly live!

						KORBEN
					(uncomfortable)
				I'll help her, I promise, but I think you
				should tell me where the Stones are!

						DIVA
				Do you love her?

						KORBEN
				I... I don't know! We hardly know
				each other... it takes time!

						DIVA
				I don't have time... I need to know.

						KORBEN
				Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman
				I loved her ... I never saw her again.

						DIVA
				I would like to have died in peace...

	The Diva's eyes close.

211	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to "15 minutes".

212	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
				You tell me to save the world then
				you go off and leave me in the shit!

	He shakes her, gently slapping her cheeks.

						KORBEN
				Come on! You're not gonna die in peace!
				You're not going to die at all! You hear me?
				Where are the Stones?

213	INT.  SPACESHIP

	Zorg sets the Sacred Case on a table in the cockpit.  He opens it with a
complacent smile:		It's empty!

	He cannot believe his eyes.  He goes berserk, destroying everything in
sight.

214	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben slaps the Diva soundly.  She comes around somewhat.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

						DIVA
					(very weak)
				They are... with me...

	The Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.  Korben frisks the
Diva but doesn't find anything.  The shooting slowly stops in the theatre.
The Mangalores are now in total control.

						MANGALORE 2
				Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
				Hands on your head and into the hall!

	The guests comply

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				...The Stones are with me?

	and then it occurs to him.

						KORBEN
				...In me?

	He touches the Diva's stomach and senses something hard.  Girding
himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a Sacred Stone.
Then another.  And another.  Korben pulls out all four Stones, covered in blue
blood.  Everyone has left the theater.  The Mangalores check the aisles one
by one.

	Loc Rhod peeks out from under a seat.

						LOC RHOD
				Don't you think we'd better be going?

	A Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva.  He grabs Korben by
the shoulder and pokes him with his gun.

						MANGALORE
				Hey, you! With the others!

	Korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  Just for
starters.  Another WARRIOR rushes over.  Korben punches him into oblivion
and snatches the gun.

						KORBEN
				That's it... I've had... all day people
				have been sticking guns in my face...

	Korben wraps up the four Stones in his shirt.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... These dudes are going
				to waste us if we don't do what they say.

	Korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

						KORBEN
				You don't do what I say... I'll waste
				you myself. Got it?

						LOC RHOD
				Got it...

215	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel.

216	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit is still in the police station facing control screens.  He barks
into a
	walkie-talkie.

						AKANIT
				What's the situation in the hall?

217	INT.  HALL

	Hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall.  They are
surrounded by Mangalores who guard them.

						MUGGER
					(into walkie-talkie)
				There's no more resistance.
				Everything's under control.

	Three Mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to
the theater.  Korben bursts into the hall, two huge guns in his hands.

						KORBEN
				Everybody down!

	Korben takes out two more WARRIORS coming towards him, rolls behind a
column.
	Laser bullets stinging all around his head.

						LOC RHOD
				This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas,
				the winner of the Gemini Croquette
				contest just killed three warriors like he was
				swatting flies...

	Panic everywhere!  Heavy firing fills the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Roy von Bacon, the laserball player, rises from the floor behind a
Mangalore, grabs him and smashes his head into a column, seizing the gun.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores firing a huge machine gun at the column Korben is using
for cover.
	He dives for cover behind the bar.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores watch awestruck.  Roy whistles behind them.  The two
Mangalores turn around.  Roy bonks their heads together.

						LOC RHOD
				It's Roy von Bacon, the Lions center
				forward joining in the battle...

	Someone taps Loc Rhod on the shoulder.  He jumps with fright.

						PRINCESS AACHEN
					(hot to trot)
				All this is terribly exciting, hmmm?

	Loc Rhod covers his mike.

						LOC RHOD
				GET OFF MY BACK!

	A Mangalore shoots in their direction.  Loc Rhod flattens himself on the
floor.  A vase falls on the Princess knocking her out.  A Mangalore loads
some missiles in his gun and destroys the bar piece by piece forcing Korben to
move forward.  Korben motions to Baby Ray hiding under the pool table.

						KORBEN
				Toss me the balls!

						BABY RAY
					(terrified, still deaf)
				What?

	Another piece of the bar explodes.

						KORBEN
				The balls for Christ's sake!

	Korben apes playing pool, but Baby Ray really is stone-deaf.

						EMPEROR JAPHET
				He wants the balls! You deaf or something?

	The EMPEROR rolls the balls over to Korben.  The Mangalore loads more
missiles and shatters another part of the bar.  Korben hides behind the last
bit left.

						KORBEN
				How far is he from here?

	The EMPEROR glances at the Mangalore, who in reloading.

						EMPEROR
				I'd say about thirty yards to the left.

	Korben hefts the ball, jumps up and hurls it with blinding  speed.  The
Mangalore catches it right in the head.  He drops, firing in the air.  The
missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him.  The emperor gives Korben
a thumb's up.

						LOC RHOD
				...And our man Korben has literally
				knocked out the opposition with an
				amazing 90 foot pitch.

	The COPS on the floor rise, scoop up weapons from dead Mangalores and lay
down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels . Roy whirls his arm
in victory.

						FOG
				Thanks for your help.

						KORBEN
				Forget it.

	Korben grabs Loc Rhod and takes him with him.

218	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Korben bursts into the room. He stares at the luminous bar still struck
to the ground and sees the hole Leeloo escaped through.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo???

219	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE - CEILING

	Leeloo in bleeding all over.  She can barely move.

						LEELOO

222	INT.  POLICE  STATION  HALLWAY - FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The last of the Mangalores have barricaded themselves in the back of the
station and shoot at anything that tries to enter.  Korben joins the
policemen already there.

						COP 1
				Hey, who are you?

						KORBEN
				The winner of the Gemini Croquette contest.

	Korben goes to the door and peeks around the corner.  Loc Rhod arrives.

						KORBEN
				Seven to the left. Five to the right.

						COP
				What's he doing?

	Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly.

						KORBEN
				Six to the left. One to the right.

						LOC RHOD
				He's on vacation.

						KORBEN
					(reloading)
				We got to find the leader. Mangalores
				don't fight without a leader.

223	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit gets up, grabs Cornelius by the throat and put a gun to his head.

						AKANIT
				One more shot and we start killing
				hostages, got that?

224	INT.  POLICE  STATION  HALLWAY

						KORBEN
				Found him...

						AKANIT
					(tense)
				Send someone to negotiate!

						KORBEN
				Mind if I go? I'm an excellent
				negotiator.

						COP 1
				Uh... Sure, go ahead.

	Korben gets ready.

						COP 1
				We're sending someone in who's
				authorized to negotiate.

225	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Korben walks quickly into the room, heads straight for Akanit, raises his
gun and puts a bullet through his head.

						KORBEN
				Anyone else want to negotiate?

						COP 2
					(to another Cop)
				Where'd he learn to negotiate like that?

226	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				From us!

	The President gives Munro a hard look.

227	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM

	The police round up the remaining Mangalores.  Korben is at the control
center screens trying to find Leeloo.  Cornelius comes over to him,
embarrassed.

						CORNELIUS
				You're probably very angry with me and
				I quite understand. But I want you to
				know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

						KORBEN
				Yeah, I know... to save the world... but
				right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo's in trouble?

						KORBEN
				When is she not in trouble?

						CORNELIUS
				Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?

	Korben realizes that Cornelius in probably right.

228	INT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE  LANDING  DOCK  AND  GARAGE

	The ZFX200 settles in the landing dock garage.  SECURITY POLICE approach
the ship just as Zorg in getting out holding the ZF1.

						POLICEMAN

						ZORG
				Nothing I can't fix myself.

	He brings up the ZF1 and wipes out the garage.

229	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Korben enters the Diva's suite which is in shambles.  He looks
everywhere, but finds nothing.

230	INT.  AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo lies in a pool of blood.  She hears something below her.

231	INT.  DIVA'S SUITE

	Exhausted, Loc Rhod wipes his forehead and finds himself face to face
with the bomb stuck on the wall.

	Korben in busy looking for Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(loudly)
				Leeloo?

	Up in the airshaft, Leeloo has heard him.

						LEELOO
				Korben...

	Her voice is too weak, Korben can't hear her.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... what the hell is this?

	Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance.

						KORBEN
				A molecular bomb.

	Three minutes left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(increasingly worried)
				And, uh, what're these numbers clicking
				by?

						CORNELIUS
				Probably the time remaining before it
				explodes.

	Cornelius smiles and continues his search.

						LOC RHOD
					(weak smile)
				You're just saying that to scare me! Right?
				If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off.
				There's bomb detectors in all these hotels!

	A general alarm goes off.  Loc Rhod is crushed.

232	INT.  MAIN  HALL

	The lights flicker.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is a Type A alert. For security reasons
				the hotel must be evacuated. Please proceed

crowd as it stampedes to the exits.

233	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Zorg marches down the corridor shooting everyone in his path.

234	INT.  DIVA'S SUITE

	Loc Rhod stands paralyzed in front of the flashing timer.  Less than two
minutes left.

						LOC RHOD
				Maybe we oughta be going,
				what do you think?

						KORBEN
				Not without Leeloo.

	Loc Rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh,
				like, we're down to 2 minutes here...

	Korben breathes out, bothered.  He turns his attention to the bomb.

						KORBEN
				It's the latest model.. I've never seen one
				before... it works off a magnetic coded
				card... Let's see if I can rig it up.

235	INT.  AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of
her blood drip down.

	The blood splats on Korben's hand.  He snaps his head up and knows
immediately who is up there.  He forgets about the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!

	Korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up
airshaft He spots Leeloo who gives him a weak smile.

						KORBEN
				Don't worry, I'm here now!

	He pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out
on the desk.

						KORBEN
				Just relax. I've got the Stones.
				Everything's going to be fine.

	30 seconds left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(falling to pieces)
				Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of
				your time here?

						KORBEN
					(to Leeloo)
				I'll be right back.

	Korben dashes over to the bomb.  He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1.
Zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				Allow me...

	Zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down
from 5 minutes.

						ZORG
				Just for the fun of it.

	Loc Rhod faints.

						ZORG
				Well, what do we have here? Is this
				Korben Dallas? The famous winner of
				the Gemini Croquette contest?
				Or is this Korben Dallas from Special
				Section sent by old Lindberg himself.

	Korben doesn't reply.

						ZORG
				...In any event, whoever you are,
				I was glad to meet you.

	Zorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead.  Nothing.  Zorg tries again.
Nada.  The clip is empty.  Zorg starts to panic.

						ZORG
				...A 3000 round clip! I didn't fire off
				3000 rounds... did I?

						KORBEN
				Don't you know how to count.
				It's not all that hard. Watch!

	Korben punches him square in the face, shows him his index.

						KORBEN
				One! That's for trying to kill me!

	Second Punch.

						KORBEN
				Two! That's for firing me! Three!
				That's for pushing around a priest!
				And the rest is for what you did to
				my wife!

	Korben pummels him mercilessly.

236	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

if he were beating on Zorg.

237	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Zorg falls to the floor, beaten to a pulp.  The timer clicks over to 3
minutes.

						KORBEN

255	INT.  ZFX200  COCKPIT - NIGHT

	Korben gently wipes Leeloo's forehead with a cloth.  She opens her eyes a
little.

						KORBEN
					(gentle, loving)
				Apipoulai..

	Leeloo smiles, weakly, feverish.

						LEELOO
				I'm so very sad.

						KORBEN
				Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't
				you say?

						LEELOO
				Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs...
				Money...
				Everything you create is used to destroy...

						KORBEN
				I told you not to read all that crap!

						LEELOO
				Protect life... Until death.

	Her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  Korben is worried.  She seems
so depressed.  Cornelius enters.

						CORNELIUS
				There's a General on the phone...
				His name's Mambo, I think.

256	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				Munro here. President Lindberg wants
				to talk to you.  Hold the line.

	The President clears his throat and takes the phone.

						PRESIDENT
				Major, first off, I want to thank you,
				in my name and in the name of the
				Federation...

257	INT.  ZFX200 / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				For the praiseworthy courage you have
				shown us! I'd like to congratulate General
				Munro for his choice. He found the ideal
				man for such a...

						KORBEN
					(to the point)
				So now what's the problem?

	The President drops into his armchair and sighs.

						PRESIDENT
				There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
				heading straight for the earth. And we have
				no idea how to stop it! ...That's the problem.

	Korben thinks fast.  The Priest is with him.  The Five Elements are on
board.

						KORBEN
				How much time before the collision?

	The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head.

						SCIENTIST
				If its speed remains constant... in an
				hour and 57 minutes.

						KORBEN (O.S.)
				I'll call you back in two hours.

	Korben hangs up.  The President looks stunned.

258	EXT.  SPACE

	The ZFX200 shifts to the speed of light and vanishes in the star-studded
cosmos.

259	INT.  CHAPEL

	David is asleep.  He is woken by the sound of...

260	EXT.  DESERT - DAWN

	The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert.

	Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.  Cornelius has the four Stones with
him.
	Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.  David appears at the door of the
chapel.

						DAVID
				You're all safe. Thanks be to God!

						CORNELIUS
				Later, David! Later!
				There's not a minute to lose!

	The small group enters the chapel.

261	INT.  CHAPEL

	Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden
barrier.  Cornelius stands in front of the cross.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray
				later?

	Cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down.  A mechanism is set off
lowering the altar like a service elevator.

	The altar descends amid rocky walls.

262	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						MUNRO
				They just landed in the desert.

						PRESIDENT
					(sweating)
				How much time is left?

263	EXT.  SPACE

	Earth is in view.  The Dark Planet fills the screen and heads for the
blue planet.

264	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
				About nine minutes.

	President Lindberg has trouble breathing.

265	INT.  TEMPLE

	Lit by torches, Korben sets Leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact
center of the four elements.  Cornelius looks over the four Stones every
which way.

						CORNELIUS
					(panic-stricken)
				Uh, this one... must be water!

	It's obvious he doesn't know where to put it.

						KORBEN
				Don't tell me you don't know how all
				this works?

						CORNELIUS
				Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form
				the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed
				to stand in the middle there, but...
				I don't have the reference book.
				I've never seen the Stones work!

	Korben can't believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand
and studies the inscriptions.  He goes over to one of the four bases the
stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  The symbol of air is on the Stone,
the same as on the base.

						KORBEN
				Match the symbols!

	Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one.  Cornelius has
found the symbol for water.  Loc Rhod sits down.  He is very tired.

						LOC RHOD
				What is this some kinda game? Like
				chess?

	Korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands.

						KORBEN
				No. It's much simpler. If we don't figure
				out where these Stones go in five minutes,
				we're all dead! Think you got it?

	Loc Rhod's got it and runs over to put in his Stone.  The four Stones are
all in place but nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				There's no light! You told me there were
				supposed to be four beams of light.

						CORNELIUS
					(lost)
				Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut!
				They have to be open for it to work.

						KORBEN
				And you don't know how they open,
				is that what you are saying?

						CORNELIUS
				That's what I'm saying.

266	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet closes in on Earth rapidly.

267	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben leans over Leeloo.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open
				them! How does it work?

						LEELOO
					(feeble)
				The wind blows... the fire burns...

						KORBEN
				I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking
				about the Stones.

						LEELOO
				...The rain falls...

	Korben is desperate.  Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out
of her.
	He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.

						KORBEN
				The rain falls... the wind blows?

	Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben.

						KORBEN
				Try and figure out how this fucking thing
				opens, instead of staring at me like that!

	Loc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(afraid)
				I'm looking, I'm looking.

268	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The tension is palpable in the President's office.

						SCIENTIST
				...Three minutes.

						MUNRO
				We've lost contact with them.

269	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben and Cornelius turn the Stones every which way.  All to no avai1.
Loc Rhod is discouraged.

						LOC RHOD
				...we'll never make it.

	He sighs.  Three hooks pop off the Stone.  Loc Rhod can't believe his
eyes.

						LOC RHOD
				It... it moved! Korben! Korben!

	Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone.

						KORBEN
				What did you say? What did you do?

						LOC RHOD
				Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do
				nothing!

						KORBEN
				Look, you did something that set it off.
				Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me
				exactly what you did!!

	Loc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement.

						LOC RHOD
				I was like this... With my hands here and...
				I said, "We'll never make it!" That's all!

	Nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				Is that all?

						LOC RHOD
				Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

	Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more.
	Korben's got it.

						KORBEN
				The wind! The wind blows...

	Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile.

						KORBEN
				Quickly, everyone on a Stone!
				Water for water!  Fire for fire!
				Earth for earth!

	The two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears.

	Loc Rhod has a problem.

						LOC RHOD
					(shaking)
				I don't have a light.  I stopped smoking
				last week! If we'd come a bit sooner...

	Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only
one left.

						KORBEN
				Don't breathe.

	Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A
small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben
feels like he's got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone.
The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch
of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.

270	EXT.  SPACE

	A mass of fire fills the screen.  The Earth is only a thousand miles
away.

271	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					Two more minutes.

	The President shuts his eyes.  His lids move in prayer.

272	INT.  CHAPEL

	Korben helps Leeloo onto her feet where the four beams and four colors
crisscross.

						KORBEN
				It's up to you now, Angel!

						LEELOO
				I'm so tired...

						KORBEN
				You can sleep tomorrow... come on...

						LEELOO
				I want to sleep... forever...

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on
				a vacation afterwards! A real vacation,
				this time, for as long as you want.
				Come on! You can do it!

	Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.
	Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
	An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

						CORNELIUS
				Come on Leeloo! Come on!

	The beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor.

273	EXT.  SPACE

	The Dark Planet hurtles toward Earth.  A hundred miles before impact.
The African continent is visible.  No doubt about it:	The fireball is
heading right for Egypt.

274	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Seconds tick away relentlessly on the scientist's stopwatch.

						SCIENTIST
				It'll be entering the atmosphere in one
				minute.

275	INT.  CHAPEL

	The heat in the temple is unbearable.  All the walls start to ooze the
same horrible black slimy liquid seen at Zorg's.  A drop of liquid falls to
the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  Loc
Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  Korben quickly straightens
Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! If you don't get on with the
				program we're all gonna die! And that's
				not on my agenda for today.

	Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck.

						LEELOO
					(weak)
				What's the use of saving lives...
				when you see what you do with them!

						KORBEN
				You're right but there are lots of good
				things... beautiful things...

						LEELOO
				...Like love...

						KORBEN
				Exactly.

						LEELOO
				But I don't know love... I'm like a machine
				programmed to save other people's lives but
				never to have one of my own.

276	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The Scientist's stopwatch goes from 30 to 29 seconds.

277	INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				I have thousands of memories but none
				of them are mine... There is no need for
				me other than this. I'm immortal but I have
				no life.

						KORBEN
				Yes, you do! I need you. More than you
				can imagine! Stand up straight!

						LEELOO
				Why?... Why would you need me?

						KORBEN
				Because...

						CORNELIUS
					(to himself)
				Tell her, for God's sake!

	A bit of the black acid falls on Loc Rhod's shirt setting it on fire.  He
rips if off.

	CUT TO:

278	INT.  CHAPEL

						KORBEN
				Because...

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes.  The heat is overpowering.  Black acid is
everywhere.

						LEELOO
				Tell me...

						KORBEN
				I love you...

	Despite her fatigue, Leeloo smiles broadly.

	CUT TO:

278b	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The stopwatch goes from 3 to 2.

279 INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				Now you're allowed to kiss me.

	- Korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he's never kissed
anybody before.  - The white beam, the Divine Light, immediately forms
around Leeloo and Korben. - The stopwatch hits zero.  - The Absolute Beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down.  - Korben and Leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow.

	- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet.  Inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet.  Screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying.

	- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites.

280	EXT.  SPACE

	The pure beam, the Light of Life, has finished its work.  The Dark Planet
nothing more than a dead planet.
	Strangely enough, it looks like the moon.  Everything is calm around it.

281	INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

	President Lindberg opens his eyes and realizes he's not dead-

						SCIENTIST
				The planet seems to have stopped at...
				62 miles from impact.

282	INT.  CHAPEL

	In the temple, the beam loses its intensity.  But Leeloo and Korben
remain stuck together, lost in their kiss.  Cornelius has dropped to his
knees, clutching his hands.

	Loc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh.  He gives Cornelius a knowing
smile.

						LOC RHOD
				This guy is a killer with the babes.
				I knew it from the moment I laid eyes
				on him.

	Cornelius and Loc Rhod burst out laughing.  Korben and Leeloo keep on
kissing.

283	INT.  LABORATORY

	We are in the Nucleological Laboratory that gave birth to Leeloo in the
beginning of our story.  The President enters the lab followed by a group
of officials in ceremonial dress.

						MUNRO
				Mr. President, let me introduce you to
				Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

						MACTILBURGH
				It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
					(beaming)
				Yes.. Well? Where are our two heroes?

						MACTILBURGH
				They were so tired from their ordeal that
				we put them in the reactor this morning..

						PRESIDENT
				I have 19 more meetings after this one
				Professor..

						PROFESSOR
				Of course.. Let me see if they're revived.

						AIDE
				We go live in one minute, Mr. President.

	Mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him
to see what is going on under the blue shield.

	Leeloo and Korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and
probably engaged in hoppi hoppa.
	Mactilburgh looks troubled.

						MACTILBURGH
				I.. uh.. they need five more minutes,
				Mr. President.

	The President, pressed for time, looks over to his aide who in struggling
with a phone call.

						AIDE
				No ma'am... I tried... No ma'am...

						PRESIDENT
				Who is it?

						AIDE
				Some woman... claims she's Korben's
				mother...

						PRESIDENT
				Give it here...

	The President takes the phone and goes to the window.

						PRESIDENT
				Mrs. Dallas, this in the President.
				On behalf of the entire Federation,
				I would like to thank...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Don't pull that crap with me, Finger...
				I'd recognize that trash can voice of
				yours in a dark alley during a rain storm.
				You tell that worthless no account son
				of mine he should plotz for the way he's
				ignored his mother... when I think of all I
				sacrificed for him...

284	EXT.  NEW YORK

	Outside the lab we see the President through the window, holding the
phone away from his ear.

	PAN slowly across Manhattan.
	Credits Roll as TWO full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky.

| Okay, this is the work-in-progress FINDING NEMO film transcript.  |
| Why is it 'work-in-progress' you might ask? Well for one, this    |
| isn't a 100% accurate transcript: some words might be missing,    |
| may not be right. Second, some lines may or may not have been     |
| spoken by the right character. There are instances in the film    |
| where a line is spoken but the character isn't on screen, which   |
| makes things complicated. But I'd say this transcript is about    |
| 98-99% accurate. Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line   |
| of equal signs (=).                                               |

MARLIN
Wow.

CORAL
Mmm.

MARLIN
Wow.

CORAL
Mmm-hmm.

MARLIN
Wow.

CORAL
Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful.

MARLIN
So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna
get the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your
man deliver or did he deliver?


                                             1

CORAL
My man delivered.

MARLIN
And it wasn't so easy.

CORAL
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.

MARLIN
You better believe they did--every single one of them.

CORAL
Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.

MARLIN
So, you do like it, don't you?

CORAL
No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable
with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space?

MARLIN
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,
look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by
their bedroom window.

CORAL
Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids.

MARLIN
Oh, right. Right.

CORAL
Aww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.

MARLIN
You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then
this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.

CORAL
I like Nemo.

MARLIN
Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

CORAL
Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!

MARLIN
Yeah. What if they don't like me?

CORAL
Marlin.

MARLIN
No, really.

CORAL
There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.

CORAL
What?

MARLIN
You remember how we met?

CORAL
Well, I try not to.

MARLIN
Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'

CORAL
Marlin!

MARLIN

                                             2

'Well, you gotta look a little closer because it's wiggling'.

CORAL
Get away!

MARLIN
Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?

MARLIN
[gasps] Coral, get inside the house, Coral. No, Coral, don't. They'll be fine. Just get
inside, you, right now.

MARLIN
No!

MARLIN
Coral! Coral?

MARLIN
Coral? Oh!

MARLIN
Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will
never let anything happen to you...Nemo.

======================================================================================

NEMO
First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!

MARLIN
I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.

NEMO
Not you, dad. Me!

MARLIN
Okay...huh?

NEMO
Get up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school!
It's time for school! Oh boy! Oh boy!

MARLIN
All right, I'm up.

NEMO
Oh boy--whoa!

MARLIN
Nemo!

NEMO
First day of school!

MARLIN
[gasps] Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it.
All right, where's the break? You feel a break?

NEMO
No.

MARLIN
Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?

NEMO
No.

MARLIN
Are you woozy?

NEMO
No.

MARLIN
How many stripes do I have?


                                             3

NEMO
I'm fine.

MARLIN
Answer the stripe question!

NEMO
Three.

MARLIN
No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh,
you're okay. How's the lucky fin?

NEMO
Lucky.

MARLIN
Let's see.

MARLIN
Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

NEMO
Come on, dad. It's time for school.

MARLIN
Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.

NEMO
Ohh...

MARLIN
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

NEMO
Yes.

MARLIN
Brush.

NEMO
Okay, I'm done.

MARLIN
You missed a spot.

NEMO
Where?

MARLIN
There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!

======================================================================================

MARLIN
All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get
some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?

NEMO
It's not safe.

MARLIN
That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.
And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes,
if you wanna do it four times--

NEMO
Dad..

MARLIN
All right. Come on, boy.

NEMO
Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!

MARLIN

                                             4

I highly doubt that.

NEMO
Have you ever met a shark?

MARLIN
No, and I don't plan to.

NEMO
How old are sea turtles?

MARLIN
Sea turtles? I don't know.

NEMO
Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about
a hundred years old!

MARLIN
Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking
to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin,
hold my fin.

NEMO
Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?

MARLIN
Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.

FISH KIDS
Bye, mom!

FISH MOM
I'll pick you up after school.

CRAB KID
Come on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!

MARLIN
Come on, we'll try over there.

MARLIN
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?

BOB
Well, look who's out of the anemone.

MARLIN
Yes. Shocking, I know.

BOB
Marty, right?

MARLIN
Marlin.

BOB
Bob.

TED
Ted.

BILL
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.

BOB/TED
Yeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.

MARLIN
Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any
other fish.

BILL
Aw, come on, clownie.

TED
Yeah, do something funny.

                                             5

BOB
Yeah!

MARLIN
All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he
doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place
and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.
None of them   were walking, so forget that I--

BOB
Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!

KIDS
Whoa!

MR. JOHANSSEN
All right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?

NEMO
Dad, dad...can I go play too? Can I?

MARLIN
I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.

MARLIN
That's where I would play

PEARL
What's wrong with his fin?

TAD
He looks funny!

SHELDON
Ow! Hey, what'd I do? What'd I do?

BOB
Be nice. It's his first time at school.

MARLIN
He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.

NEMO
Dad.

PEARL
See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really
tell.Especially when I twirl them like this.

SHELDON
I'm H2O-intolerant. [sneezes]

TAD
I'm obnoxious.

MR. RAY
[singing] Oooh, let's name the zones, the zones, the zones. Let's name the zones of the
open sea.

KIDS
Mr. Ray!

SHELDON
Come on, Nemo.

MARLIN
Whoa, you better stay with me.

MR. RAY
[singing]..mesopolagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and
me to see.

MR. RAY
Huh, I wonder where my class has gone?

KIDS

                                               6

We're under here!

MR. RAY
Oh, there you are. Climb aboard, explorers. [singing] Oh, knowledge exploring is oh so
lyrical, when you think thoughts that are empirical.

NEMO
Dad, you can go now.

MR. RAY
Well, hello. Who is this?

NEMO
I'm Nemo.

MR. RAY
Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

NEMO
Okay.

MR. RAY
You live in what kind of home?

NEMO
An anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--

MR. RAY
Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!

MARLIN
Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him
take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes.

NEMO
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

MR. RAY
Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves...that means you, Jimmy.

JIMMY
Aw, man!

MR. RAY
[singing]

MARLIN
Bye, Nemo!

NEMO
Bye, dad!

MARLIN
Bye, son! Be safe.

BOB
Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer.

MARLIN
Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?

BILL
Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.

MARLIN
They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you,
insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?

BOB
Hey, Marty. Calm down.

MARLIN
Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!

BOB
'Pony boy'?

                                             7

BILL
You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.

TED
Pity.

======================================================================================

MR. RAY
[singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species
that live in thesea.

NEMO
Whoa.

MR. RAY
[singing] There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me. Come
on, sing with me. Oh...!

MR. RAY
Just the girls this time. [singing] Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it's food
with the rays of the sun...

MR. RAY
Okay, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore but stay close. [gasps]
Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.
There are as many protein pairs contained in this...

TAD
Come on, let's go.

MR. RAY
Come on, sing with me! [singing] There's porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa,
ctenophora, bryozoas, three!

NEMO
Hey guys, wait up! Whoa.

TAD
Cool.

TAD
Saved your life!

PEARL
Aw, you guys made me ink.

NEMO
What's that?

TAD
I know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a
butt.

NEMO
Whoa.

PEARL
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

SHELDON
Oh, look at me. I'm gonna go touch the butt. [sneezes] Whoa!

SHELDON
Oh yeah? Let's see you get closer.

PEARL
Okay. Beat that.

TAD
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

NEMO
Uh, my dad says it's not safe.


                                             8

MARLIN
Nemo, no!

NEMO
Dad?

MARLIN
You were about to swim into open water!

NEMO
No, I wasn't go out--but dad!

MARLIN
It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--

PEARL
Sir, he wasn't gonna go.

TAD
Yeah, he was too afraid.

NEMO
No, I wasn't.

MARLIN
This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out
there.
You know you can't swim well.

NEMO
I can swim fine, dad, okay?

MARLIN
No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school
in a year or two.

NEMO
No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--

MARLIN
Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do
these
things but you just can't, Nemo!

NEMO
I hate you.

MR. RAY
There's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a
scientist, sir. Is there any problem?

MARLIN
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little
too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.

MR. RAY
Well, I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.

MARLINLook, I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost
from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking--

FISH KID
Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!

MARLIN
Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get
you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one
move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me?
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

TAD
[whispering] He touched the butt.

MARLIN
You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.
Do you hear me? Big...big--


                                             9

NEMO
Aaaah! Daddy! Help me!

MARLIN
I'm coming, Nemo!

KIDS
Aaaah!

MR. RAY
Get under me, kids!

NEMO
Ah! Oh no! Dad! Daddy!

MARLIN
Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo!

DIVER
Whoa! Hold on.

MARLIN
Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No!
Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no!

MARLIN
Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please!

DORY
Look out!

MARLIN
Waaaah!

MARLIN
Ooh, ooh...

DORY
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry! I didn't see you. Sir, are you okay?

MARLIN
He's gone, he's gone..

DORY
There, there. It's all right.

MARLIN
He's gone.

DORY
It'll be okay.

MARLIN
No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.

DORY
Hey, I've seen a boat.

MARLIN
You have?

DORY
It passed by not too long ago.

MARLIN
A white one?

DORY
Hi. I'm Dory.

MARLIN
Where!? Which way!?

DORY
Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!

MARLIN

                                             10

Thank you! Thank you, thank you so much!

DORY
No problem.

MARLIN
Hey! Wait!

DORY
Will you quit it?

MARLIN
What?

DORY
I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?

MARLIN
Huh?

DORY
You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah,
oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?

MARLIN
Wait a minute..

DORY
Stop following me, okay!?

MARLIN
What? You're showing me which way the boat went!

DORY
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this
way. Follow me!

MARLIN
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat
was going!

DORY
I did? Oh dear...

MARLIN
If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!

DORY
No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

MARLIN
Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this!

DORY
No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think
it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?

MARLIN
Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps]

BRUCE
Hello.

DORY
Well, hi!

BRUCE
Name's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of
bites like you doing out so late, eh?

MARLIN
Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out.

BRUCE
Great! Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm havin'?

DORY

                                             11

You mean like a party?

BRUCE
Yeah, yeah, that's right--a party! What do you say?

DORY
Ooh, I love parties! Parties are fun!

MARLIN
Parties are fun, and it's tempting but--

BRUCE
Oh, come on, I insist.

MARLIN
O-okay..that's all that matters.

DORY
Hey, look--balloons! It is a party!

BRUCE
Ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

BRUCE
Anchor! Chum!

ANCHOR
There you are, Bruce, finally!

BRUCE
We got company.

ANCHOR
It's about time, mate.

CHUM
We've already gone through all the snacks and I'm still starvin'!

ANCHOR
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

CHUM
Come on, let's get this over with.

======================================================================================

BRUCE
Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge..

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
'I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must
first change myself. Fish are friends, not food'.

ANCHOR
Except stinkin' dolphins.

CHUM
Dolphins! Yeah, they think they're sooo cute! 'Hey, look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin!
Let me flip for 'ya! Ain't I a somethin'!'

BRUCE
Right, then. Today's meeting is step 5, 'BRING A FISH FRIEND'. Now do you all have your
friends?

ANCHOR
Got mine.

DORY
Hey there!

BRUCE
How 'bout you, Chum?

CHUM
Oh, um, I seem to have misplaced my uh, friend.


                                             12

BRUCE
That's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself
to one of my friends.

CHUM
Oh, thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?

BRUCE
I'll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.

ANCHOR/CHUM
Hello, Bruce.

BRUCE
It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and
made into soup.

CHUM
You're an inspiration to all of us.

ANCHOR
Amen.

BRUCE
Right, then. Who's next?

DORY
Ooh! Pick me! Pick me!

BRUCE
Yes, the little Sheila down the front.

DORY
Woo-hoo!

BRUCE
Come on up here.

DORY
Hi. I'm Dory.

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
Hello, Dory.

DORY
And, uh, well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

CHUM
Hey, that's incredible.

BRUCE
Good on 'ya, mate!

DORY
Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest.

BRUCE
All right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?

MARLIN
Me? I don't have a problem.

BRUCE
Oh. Okay..

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
Denial.

BRUCE
Just start with your name.

MARLIN
Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish--

CHUM
A clownfish? Really?!


                                             13

BRUCE
Go on, tell us a joke!

CHUM
Ooh! I love jokes!

MARLIN
Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea
cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the
sea mollusk says to the cucumber...

NEMO
Daddy!

MARLIN
Nemo!

CHUM
Nemo! Ha ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it.

BRUCE
For a clownfish, he's not that funny.

MARLIN
No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers.

DORY
Oh my, you poor fish.

CHUM
Humans. Think they own everything.

ANCHOR
Probably American.

BRUCE
Now there is a father looking for his little boy.

MARLIN
Ugh! What do these markings mean?

BRUCE
I never knew my father! [sobs]

CHUM
Aw, come here.

ANCHOR
Group hug.

CHUM
We're all mates here, mate.

MARLIN
I can't read human.

DORY
Well then we gotta find a fish who can read this. Hey, look. Sharks!

MARLIN
No, no, no, Dory!

DORY
Guys, guys!

MARLIN
No, Dory!

DORY
That's mine! Give it to me! Gimme! Oww!

MARLIN
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

DORY
Ow, ow, ow.


                                             14

MARLIN
I'm so sorry.

DORY
You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?

MARLIN
Ohh...

DORY
Ow, ow, ow.

BRUCE
Dory, are you oka--oohh. Oohh, that's good.

ANCHOR/CHUM
Intervention!

BRUCE
Just a bite!

ANCHOR
Hold it together, mate!

CHUM
Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!

BRUCE
FOOD!

MARLIN
Dory, look out!

BRUCE
I'm havin' fish tonight!

CHUM
Remember the steps, mate!

BRUCE
Just one bite!

BRUCE
G'day!

MARLIN/DORY
Aaaaaaaah!

BRUCE
Arrrr!

MARLIN
There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!

DORY
Who is it?

MARLIN
Dory, help me find a way out!

DORY
Sorry, you'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape.

MARLIN
There's gotta be a way out!

DORY
Look, here's something! 'ESSS-CA-PE'! I wonder what that means. It's funny, it's spelled
just like the word 'escape'.

MARLIN
Let's go!

BRUCE
Here's Brucey!

MARLIN

                                               15

Wait a minute..you can read?!

DORY
I can read? That's right, I can read!

MARLIN
Well, then here. Read this now!

ANCHOR
He really doesn't mean it, y'know! He never even knew his father!

CHUM
Don't fall off the wagon!

MARLIN
Oh no, it's blocked!

ANCHOR
No, Bruce. Focus!

CHUM
Sorry about--this, mate!

ANCHOR
He's really--a nice guy!

MARLIN
I need to get that mask!

DORY
You want that mask? Okay.

MARLIN
No, no, no, no, no, no!

MARLIN
Quick grab the mask!

ANCHOR
Oh no. Bruce?

BRUCE
What? [gasps] Swim away! Swim away!

DORY
Aw, is the party over?

PELICAN
Nice.

======================================================================================

NEMO
Dad? Daddy?

DENTIST
Barbara?

BARBARA
Uh-huh?

DENTIST
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few cotton rolls.

BARBARA
Okay.

DENTIST
Hello, little fella!

NEMO
Aah!

DENTIST
Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef and
I saved him. So, has that novocaine kicked in yet?


                                             16

PATIENT
I think so. We're ready to roll.

BUBBLES
Bubbles! [muttering] My bubbles.

PEACH
He likes bubbles.

NEMO
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

JACQUES
Bonjour.

NEMO
Aah!

BLOAT
Heh heh! Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about.

DEB
Oh, he's scared to death.

NEMO
I wanna go home. Do you know where my dad is?

PEACH
Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.

NEMO
Pet store?

BLOAT
Yeah, you know, like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

GURGLE
Pet Palace.

BUBBLES
Fish-O-Rama.

DEB
Mail order.

PEACH
Ebay.

GURGLE
So which one is it?

NEMO
I'm from the ocean.

GURGLE
Ah, the ocean. The ocean! Aaah! He hasn't been decontaminated yet! Jacques!

JACQUES
Oui.

GURGLE
Clean him!

JACQUES
Oui.

GURGLE
Ocean!

JACQUES
Ooh, la mer. Bon. Voila. He is clean.

BUBBLES
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

NEMO
Big...and blue?

                                             17

BUBBLES
I knew it.

DEB
Kid, if there's anything you need, just ask your auntie Deb, that's me. Or if I'm not
around, you can always talk to my sister Flo. Hi,how are you? Don't listen to anything
my sister says, she's nuts! Ha ha ha ha!

PEACH
[muffled] We got a live one!

BLOAT
Can't hear you, Peach.

PEACH
I said we got a live one.

GURGLE
Yes!

BLOAT
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

DEB
What do we got?

PEACH
Root canal, and by the looks of those x-rays it's not gonna be pretty.

PATIENT
Owwwwwwwww!

BLOAT
Rubber dam and clamp installed?

PEACH
Yep.

GURGLE
What did he use to open?

PEACH
Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to be favoring that one lately.

DEB
I can't see, Flo.

PATIENT
You're getting a little too--aaaaah!!!

PEACH
Now he's doing the Schilder technique.

BLOAT
Oooh, he's using a Hedstrom file.

GURGLE
That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.

BLOAT
It's got a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom.

GURGLE
No, no. K-Flex.

BLOAT
Hedstrom!

GURGLE
K-Flex!

BLOAT
Hedstro--! [inflates] There I go. A little help over here.

DEB
I'll go deflate him.

                                               18

DENTIST
All right, go ahead and rinse.

GURGLE
Ugh! The human mouth is a disgusting place.

PEACH
Hey, Nigel.

NIGEL
What did I miss? Am I late?

PEACH
Root canal and it's a doozy.

NIGEL
Root canal, eh? What did he use to open?

PEACH
Gator-Glidden drill.

NIGEL
He seems to be favoring that one. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus...
hello.

NEMO
[gasps]

NIGEL
Who's this?

DEB
New guy. Ha ha ha!

GURGLE
The dentist took him off the reef.

NIGEL
An outie. From my neck of the woods, eh? Sorry if I ever took a snap at you. Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat. [gasps]

DENTIST
Hey! No, no,   no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go! Go on, shoo! Oh,
the picture   broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. She's going to be eight next week.
Hey, little   fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're
her present.   Shh, shh, shh! It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up
I'm going to   see a man about a wallaby.

BLOAT
Oh, Darla.

NEMO
What? What's wrong with her?

GURGLE
She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

BUBBLES
Poor Chuckles.

DEB
He was her present last year.

BLOAT
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

PEACH
She's a fish killer.

NEMO
I can't go with that girl! I have to get back to my dad! Aaah! Daddy! Help me!

GURGLE
Oh, he's stuck!

GILL

                                               19

Nobody touch him! Nobody touch him.

NEMO
Can you help me?

GILL
No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.

PEACH
Gill..

GILL
I just wanna see him do it, okay? Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.

NEMO
I can't. I have a bad fin.

GILL
Never stopped me.

GILL
Just think about what you need to do.

BLOAT
Come on.

GILL
Perfect.

BUBBLES
Yay!

GURGLE
You did it!

DEB
Good squirming! Ha ha ha!

PEACH
Wow. From the ocean. Just like you, Gill.

GILL
Yeah.

PEACH
I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about?

GILL
I'm thinking, tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.

BLOAT
So kid, you got a name or what?

NEMO
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

======================================================================================

MARLIN
Nemo. Nemo. [mutters]

DORY
Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that hammer...

MARLIN
Huh? No, no! What does it say? Dory!

DORY
Sea monkey has my money...

MARLIN
Wake up! Get up! Come on! Come on!

DORY
Yes, I'm a natural blue...

MARLIN

                                             20

Get up!

DORY
Look out! Sharks eat fish! Aaaaaah!

MARLIN/DORY
AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

DORY
Wow. Dusty.

MARLIN
[gasps] The mask! Where's the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!

DORY
[singing] Hoo doot doo doot doot doo doot. Whoo-hoo! La la la la la la. Just keeps
going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo! Hey, what are you doing?

MARLIN
It's gone. I've lost the mask.

DORY
Did you drop it?

MARLIN
You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone.

DORY
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?

MARLIN
I don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down.

DORY
[singing] Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do?
We swim, swim.

MARLIN
Dory, no singing.

DORY
[singing] Ho ho ho ho ho ho! I love to swim! When you want to swim..

MARLIN
See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head!

DORY
Sorry.

MARLIN
Dory, do you see anything?

DORY
Aaah! Something's got me!

MARLIN
That was me. I'm sorry.

DORY
[gasps] Who was that?

MARLIN
Who could it be? It's me!

DORY
Are..are you my conscience?

MARLIN
Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?

DORY
Hmm, can't complain.

MARLIN
Yeah? Good. Now, Dory. I want you to tell me..do you see anything?


                                             21

DORY
I see..I see a light.

MARLIN
A light.

DORY
Yeah. Over there. Hey, conscience. Am I dead?

MARLIN
No, I see it too. What is it?

DORY
It's so pretty.

MARLIN
I'm feeling...happy. Which is a big deal for me.

DORY
I want to touch it. Oh!

MARLIN
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

DORY
[singing] I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna swim with you.

MARLIN
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend...good feeling's gone.

MARLIN
I can't see! I don't know where I'm going!

DORY
Haah!

MARLIN
The mask!

DORY
What mask?

DORY
Okay, I can't see a thing.

MARLIN
Oh, gee!

DORY
Hey, look! A mask!

MARLIN
Read it!

DORY
I'm sorry, but if you could just bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.
That's great, keep it right there.


MARLIN
Just read it!

DORY
Okay, okay. Mr. Bossy. Uh, 'P'. Okay, 'P'. 'Shh-eer...Sher--P. Sher--P. Shirley? P.--'. Oh!
The first line's 'P. Sherman'!

MARLIN
P. Sherman doesn't make any sense!

DORY
Okay, second line. '42'.

MARLIN
Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Aaaah!

DORY
Light, please. 'Walla--Walla--Walla-beee'...

                                               22

MARLIN
Waah! Waaah! Waaaah!

DORY
The second line's '42 Wallaby Way'!

MARLIN
That's great! Speed read! Take a guess! No pressure! No problem! There's a lot of pressure!
Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure!

DORY
'Sydney'. It's 'Sydney'!

MARLIN
Duck!

DORY
Aaah!

MARLIN
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead.

MARLIN
Whoo-hoo! [singing] We did it, we did it! Oh yeah, yeah, yeah! No eating here tonight, whoo!

BOTH
[singing] Eating here tonight!

MARLIN
Dory.

DORY
[singing] No, no, no eating here tonight. You on a diet--

MARLIN
Dory! What did the mask say?

DORY
'P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney'. [gasps] I remember what it said! I usually forget
things, but I remembered it this time!

MARLIN
Whoa, whoa, wait! Where is that?

DORY
I don't know. But who cares? I remembered!

MARLIN/DORY
Aaah!

DORY
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!

JACQUES
Psst. Nemo.

NEMO
Mmmm...

JACQUES
Nemo.

NEMO
Huh?

JACQUES
Suivez-moi. Follow me.

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
[chanting] Ha! Ho! Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ha! Ho! Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ha! Ho!
Hwa! Hwee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Hahoo! Wahoo! Yahoo! Ho! Ha! Ho! Wahee! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho! Hoo!

GILL
State your name.

                                             23

NEMO
Nemo.

GILL
Brother Bloat, proceed.

BLOAT
Nemo! Newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mount
Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

NEMO
Huh?

PEACH
We want you in our club, kid.

NEMO
Really?

BLOAT
If you are able to swim through..THE RING OF FIRE! [whispers to Jacques] Turn on the
Ring of Fire! The Ring of Fire, you said you could do it--THE RING OF FIRE!

BUBBLES
Bubbles! Bubbles! Let me--oww!

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
[chanting]

PEACH
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy!

JACQUES
[wailing]

GILL
From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait.

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!

GILL
Welcome, brother Sharkbait!

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!

GILL
Enough with the Sharkbait.

GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh..ba-ba-doo.

GILL
Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Agreed!

GILL
We can't send him off to his death. Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here. We're gonna help
him escape.

NEMO
Escape? Really?

GILL
We're all gonna escape!

GURGLE
Gill, please, not another one of your escape plans.

DEB
Sorry, but they, they just, they never work.


                                               24

BLOAT
Yeah. Why should this be any different?

GILL
'Cause we've got him.

NEMO
Me?

GILL
You see that filter?

NEMO
Yeah?

GILL
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take
a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and
filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And
when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll
ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the
street and into the harbor! It's foolproof! Who's with me?

BLOAT
Aye!

JACQUES
Aye!

DEB
Aye!

BUBBLES
Aye!

GURGLE
I think your nuts.

GILL/NEMO
[sighs]

GURGLE
No offense, kid, but, um..you're not the best swimmer.

GILL
He's fine, he can do this. So Sharkbait, what do you think?

NEMO
Let's do it.

======================================================================================

DORY
I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? I'm going to P.
Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you're askin' where I'm goin'. I'll tell you that's
where I'm going. It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
you. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way...

MARLIN
Excuse me. Ex-excuse me, um, hi. Do you know how to get to--hello? W-w-w-wait! Can you
tell me--hey! Hold it! Wait a minute! I'm trying to talk to you. Okay, fellas, come back
here. Please, one quick question. I need to aaaaand they're gone again. [sighs]

DORY
P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell
you again. I don't get tired of it--

MARLIN
Okay, all right.

DORY
Huh?

MARLIN
Here's the thing.

DORY

                                             25

Uh-huh.

MARLIN
Y'know, I just, I-I think it's best if I just, if I just, carry on from here by..by myself.

DORY
Okay.

MARLIN
Y'know, alone.

DORY
Uh-huh.

MARLIN
Without, without..well, I mean, not without you. I mean, it's just that I don't want you...
with me.

DORY
Huh?

MARLIN
I don't wanna hurt your feelings..

DORY
You want me to leave?

MARLIN
Well, I mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know I-I just can't afford anymore delays
and you're one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it's a good thing. There's
a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'.

DORY
You mean..[whimper]you mean you don't..like me? [sobs]

MARLIN
No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't wanna be with you. It's a
complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. I like you.

MOONFISH LEADER
Hey, you! Lady, is this guy botherin' you?

DORY
Um, I don't remember. Were you?

MARLIN
No, no, no, no, no. We're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how I can get to--

MOONFISH LEADER
Look, pal. We're talkin' to the lady, not you. Hey-hey, you like impressions?

DORY
Mm-mmm-mmmm.

MOONFISH LEADER
Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. So, what are we? Take a guess.

DORY
Oh, oh, I've seen one of those.

MOONFISH LEADER
I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

DORY
Wait, wait, um..

MARLIN
It's a swordfish.

MOONFISH LEADER
Hey, clown boy! Let the lady guess. Where's the butter?

DORY
Oh-oh-oh! It's on the tip of my tongue.

MARLIN
[coughs up answer]Lobster.

                                             26

MOONFISH LEADER
Saw that.

MARLIN
What?

MOONFISH LEADER
Lots of legs, lives in the ocean.

DORY
Clam!

MOONFISH LEADER
Close enough. [singing] Oh, it's a whale of a tale, I'll tell you lad, a whale of a tale.

DORY
Oh, they're good.

MARLIN
Will somebody please give me directions?

MOONFISH LEADER
[impersonating Marlin] Will somebody please give me directions?

DORY
Ha ha ha ha ha!

MARLIN
I'm serious.

MOONFISH LEADER
Blah-blah-blah! Me-me-blah! Blah-blah-blah-blah-me-me-me!

MARLIN
Thank you.

DORY
Oh dear. Hey, hey come back! Hey, what's the matter?

MARLIN
What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from
home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name.

DORY
Boy, bet that's frustrating.

MARLIN
Yeah. Meanwhile my son is out there.

DORY
You're son Chico?

MARLIN
Nemo.

DORY
Right. Got it.

MARLIN
But it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me.

DORY
Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Hey, guys.

MOONFISH LEADER
What, is he bothering you again?

DORY
No, no, he's a good guy. Go easy on him, he's lost his son, Fabio. Any of you heard of
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

MOONFISH LEADER
Sydney? Oh sure. Why, Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted?

MOONFISH TED
Sure do.

                                             27

DORY
Oh, hey! They know Sydney!

MARLIN
[gasps]

DORY
You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?

MOONFISH LEADER
What you wanna do is follow the EAC, that's the East Australian Current. Big current,
can't miss it, it's in..that direction. And then you gotta follow that for about, I
don't know, what do you guys think? About three leagues? And that little baby's gonna
put you right past Sydney.

MOONFISH SCHOOL
TA-DAA!

MARLIN
Great! That's great! Dory, you did it!

DORY
Oh, please. I'm just your little helper. Helping along, that's me.

MARLIN
Well, listen fellas, thank you.

MOONFISH LEADER
Don't mention it. And, uh, loosen up. Okay, buddy?

DORY
Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye.

MOONFISH LEADER
Oh, hey ma'am, one more thing.

DORY
Yes.

MOONFISH LEADER
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.

DORY
Trench, through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait up, partner.
Hold on. Wait! Wait-wait! I got, I gotta tell you something..whoa. Nice trench. Hello!
Okay, let's go.

MARLIN
Bad trench, bad trench. Come on, we're gonna swim over this thing.

DORY
Whoa, whoa, partner. Little red flag goin' up. Somethin's telling me we should swim through
it, not over it.

MARLIN
Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it.

DORY
I'm sorry, but I really, really, really think we should swim through.

MARLIN
And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.

DORY
Come on, trust me on this.

MARLIN
Trust you?

DORY
Yes, trust. It's what friends do.

MARLIN
Look! Something shiny!

DORY

                                             28

Where?

MARLIN
Oh, it just swam over the trench. Come on, we'll follow it.

DORY
Okay.

DORY
Boy, sure is clear up here.

MARLIN
Exactly. And look at that, there's the current. We should be there in no time.

DORY
Hey, little guy.

MARLIN
You wanted to go through the trench.

DORY
I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy. Come here,
Squishy. Come here, little Squishy. [Baby talk]---oww!

MARLIN
Dory! That's a jellyfish!

DORY
Bad Squishy! Bad Squishy!

MARLIN
Shoo! Shoo, shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see.

DORY
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

MARLIN
I'm not gonna touch it. I just wanna look.

DORY
Heeey, how come it didn't sting you?

MARLIN
It did. It's just that..

DORY
Ow! Ow, oww!

MARLIN
..hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm, I'm, I'm used to these kind of stings.
Come here.

DORY
Ow, ow! Oww!

MARLIN
It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we?

DORY
Yeah.

MARLIN
That we don't wanna touch these again. Let's be thankful this time it was just a
little one.[gasps]

MARLIN/DORY
Aaaah!

MARLIN
Don't move! This is bad, Dory.

DORY
Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing!

MARLIN
[gasps] Dory!


                                             29

DORY
Boing-boing-boing! [singing] You can't catch me!

MARLIN
Dory! Don't bounce on the tops! They will..not sting you. The tops don't sting you,
that's it!

DORY
Ooh! Two in a row, beat that.

MARLIN
Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game.

DORY
A game?

MARLIN
A game.

DORY
A game?

MARLIN
Yes.

DORY
Aah! I love games! Pick me!

MARLIN
All right, here's the game. Um, whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins.

DORY
Okay!

MARLIN
Rules, rules, rules!

DORY
Okay!

MARLIN
You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops.

DORY
Something about tentacles, got it. On your mark, get set, go!

MARLIN
W-wait! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Wait!

DORY
Weeee!

MARLIN
Dory!

DORY
Gotta go faster if you wanna win!

MARLIN
[gasps] Dory!

DORY
Boing! Boing! Boing-boing-boing-boing!

MARLIN
Wait a minute--whoa! Dory!

DORY
Weeee!

MARLIN
So, we're cheating death now. That's what we're doin'. We're havin' fun at the same time.
I can do this, just be careful.

DORY
Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!


                                             30

MARLIN
Oh, I don't think so!

DORY
Ha ha ha ha! Whooo! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution, I was built for speed.

MARLIN
The question is, Dory, are you hungry?

DORY
Huh? Hungry?

MARLIN
Yeah, 'cause you're about to eat my bubbles! Duck to the left! Right there! The clownfish
is the winner! Woohoo! We did it! We're gonna...Dory? Oh no. Dory! Dory! Dory! [gasps]
Dory! Uggghhh!

DORY
Ugh...am I disqualified?

MARLIN
No, you're doing fine! You're, you're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Uh, where
does P. Sherman live?

DORY
P..Sherman..Wallaby Way...Sydney...

MARLIN
That's it! Oww! Ow! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ow! Stay awake! Stay--awake!

DORY
Awake...P..Sherman..

MARLIN
Awake...

DORY
..42 Wallaby Way...

MARLIN
Awake...wake up...Nemo...

GILL
You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?

NEMO
Yeah.

GILL
Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's lookin' for you.

NEMO
He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean.

GILL
Peach, any movement?

PEACH
He's had at least four cups of coffee, it's gotta be soon.

GILL
Keep on him.

GILL
My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin' for the toilet.

NEMO
Toilet?

GILL
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

NEMO
Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?


                                             31

GILL
Aah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to 'ya.

BUBBLES
Bubbles! Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles---

PEACH
Potty break! Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader's Digest! We have 4.2 minutes.

GILL
That's your cue, Sharkbait.

BLOAT
You can do it, kid.

GILL
Okay, you gotta be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber
and I'll talk you through the rest.

NEMO
Okay.

GILL
Go on, it'll be a piece of kelp.

NEMO
[takes a deep breath]

GILL
Nicely done! Can you hear me?

NEMO
Yeah.

GILL
Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening?

NEMO
Uh-huh.

GILL
Okay, inside it you'll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the
fan to stop it turning.

NEMO
Aaah!

GILL
Careful, Sharkbait.

NEMO
I can't do it!

PEACH
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

GILL
He'll be fine. Try again.

NEMO
Okay.

GILL
That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady.

NEMO
I got it! I got it!

PEACH
[sigh]

BLOAT
He did it!

GURGLE
Whew!


                                             32

GILL
That's great, kid! Now, swim up the tube and out.

NEMO
Oh no! Gill! Gill!

GILL
Sharkbait!

BLOAT
Oh my gosh!

GILL
Get 'im outta there! Get 'im outta there!

BUBBLES
Help him!

GURGLE
What do we do!? What do we do!?

PEACH
Oh no!

GILL
Stay calm, kid! Just don't panic!

NEMO
Help me!

GILL
Sharkbait! Grab hold of this!

NEMO
No! No!

GILL
Feed me more!

GURGLE
That's it!

GILL
Come on, Sharkbait! Grab it!

NEMO
I got it!

GILL
Pull!

PEACH
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

GILL
No. We're done.

CRUSH
Oh, saw the whole thing, dude. First you were like, 'whoa'! And then we were all like,
'whoa'! And then you were like, 'whoa'.

MARLIN
What're you talking about?

CRUSH
You, mini-man. Takin' on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude.

MARLIN
Ooh.

CRUSH
Awesome.

MARLIN
Ooh..ooh, my stomach. Ooooh..

CRUSH
Oh, man. No hurlin' on the shell, dude, okay, just waxed it.

MARLIN

CRUSH
Ha ha! Righteous! Righteous! Yeah!

MARLIN
Stop!

CRUSH
So, what brings you on this fine day to the EAC?

MARLIN
Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney. [gasps] Dory! Dory! Is she all right!?

CRUSH
Oh. Oh, Little Blue. She is sub-level, dude.

MARLIN
Dory, Dory! Dory!

DORY
Hmm-mmm....

MARLIN
Oh, Dory. I-I-I'm so sorry. This is all my fault, it's my fault...

DORY

CRUSH
Whoa. Kill the motor, dude. Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

SQUIRT
Whoa! Whoa! That was so cool! Hey dad, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see
what I did?

CRUSH
You so totally rock, Squirt! So give me some fin..noggin..

CRUSH/SQUIRT

CRUSH
Oh, intro. Jellyman, Offspring. Offspring, Jellyman.

SQUIRT
Jellies? Sweet.

CRUSH
Totally.

MARLIN
Well, apparently, I must've done something you all like. Heh, uh, dudes.

SQUIRT
You rock, dude.

MARLIN
Ow.

CRUSH
Curl away, my son. Aw, it's awesome, Jellyman. Little dudes are just eggs, leave 'em
on the beach to hatch, then coo-coo-ca-choo, they find their way back to the big 'ol blue.

MARLIN
All by themselves?

CRUSH
Yeah.

MARLIN
But-but-but dude, how do you know when they're ready?

CRUSH
Well, you never really know. But when they'll know, you'll know, you know? Ha.

DORY
Hey! Look, everybody!

SQUIRT
I know that dude. It's the Jellyman.

DORY
Well, go on, jump on him.

TURTLE KIDS
Turtle pile!

MARLIN
W-w-wai-wait--

TURTLE KID 1
Are you funny?

TURTLE KID 2
Where's your shell?

MARLIN
Hold on, I need to breath--

TURTLE KID 3
Are you running away?

TURTLE KID 4
Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?


                                             35

TURTLE KID 5
Did they sting you?

MARLIN
One at a time!

TURTLE KID 6
Mr. Fish, did you die?

DORY
Sorry. I was a little vague on the details.

SQUIRT
So where are you going?

MARLIN
Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.

TURTLE KIDS
[gasp]

DORY
No way.

SQUIRT
What happened?

MARLIN
No, no, no, kids. I don't wanna talk about it.

TURTLE KIDS
Awww! Please?

SQUIRT
Pleeeease?

MARLIN
[sighs] Well, okay. I live on this reef, a long long way from here.

DORY
Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell.

MARLIN
And my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been
so tough on   him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when
he was out   there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast.
So we swam   out in the ocean to follow them...

TURTLE KID
They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..

SMALL FISH
..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!

BIG FISH
Golly, that's amazing!

SMALL FISH
And then dives thousands of..

LOBSTER
..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing.
How's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..

SWORDFISH
..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.
And then he has to blast his way...

DOLPHIN
So, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian
Current.

FEMALE BIRD
Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..

MALE BIRD 1
..Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at..

                                               36

MALE BIRD 2
..nothing until he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.

MALE BIRD 3
That's one dedicated father if you ask me.

GULLS
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

NIGEL
Oh, would you just shut up! You're rats with wings!

PELICAN
..bloke's been lookin' for his boy Nemo.

NIGEL
Nemo?

PELICAN
He was taken off the reef by divers and this..

NIGEL
There, take it! You happy!

GULLS
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

NIGEL
Hey, hey, hey! Say that again! You said something about Nemo. What was it?

GULLS
Mine! Mine! Mine!

CRAB
Whooooooaaa..watcha!

GULL
Mine!

PELICAN
Last I heard, he's headin' towards the harbor.

NIGEL
Ho ho! Brilliant!

NEMO
Gill? Gill?

GILL
Hey, Sharkbait.

NEMO
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the--

GILL
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that
ocean. I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that.
I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.

NIGEL
All right! Hey, hey, hey, hey--!

Oh, Nigel. You just missed an extraction.

NIGEL
Ooh! Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet--oh, what I'm talkin' about!? Nemo!
Where's Nemo? I gotta speak with him.

NEMO
What? What is it?

NIGEL
Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean looking for you.

NEMO
My father? Really?

GILL
Really?

NIGEL
Oh yeah. He's travelled hundreds of miles. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish and
all sorts of--

NEMO
Sharks? That can't be him.

NIGEL
Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout..

NEMO
Marlin?

NIGEL
That's it! Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.

NEMO
It's my dad! He took on a shark!

NIGEL
I heard he took on three.

DEB/BLOAT/GURGLE
Three!?

GILL
Three sharks!?

BLOAT
That's gotta be forty eight hundred teeth!

NIGEL
You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat
you were on like a maniac.

NEMO
Really?

NIGEL
He's swimming and   he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic
sharks capture him   and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased
by a monster with   huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a
reward? He gets to   battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he's riding with a bunch
of sea turtles on   the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right
now, to Sydney!

                                               38

BLOAT
Wow! Ha ha ha!

DEB
Oh, what a good daddy!

GILL
He was lookin' for you after all, Sharkbait.

GILL
[gasps]

GURGLE
He's swimming to the filter!

GILL
[gasps] Sharkbait!

BLOAT
Not again!

GILL
Sharkbait!

DEB
No!

GURGLE
You've got your whole life ahead of you!

BLOAT
Oh no!

GILL
We'll help you, kid!

BLOAT
Gotta get him out!

DEB
Gimme that thing!

DEB
Get him outta there!

GURGLE
Come on, kid! Grab the end!

ALL
[gasps]

DEB
Sharkbait!

BLOAT
Sharkbait! Are you okay!?

GURGLE
No!

GILL
Can you hear me, Sharkbait!? Nemo! Can you hear me!?

NEMO
Yeah, I can hear you.

GILL
Sharkbait, you did it!

GURGLE
Sharkbait, you're--covered with germs! Aaaaaaah!!!

GILL
That took guts, kid.

GILL

                                               39

All right, gang. We have less than 48 hours before Darla gets here. This tank'll get
plenty dirty in that time but we have to help it along any way we can. Jacques!

JACQUES
Oui!

GILL
No cleaning.

JACQUES
I shall resist.

GILL
Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank
so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it.

BLOAT
[belch]

GILL
Good work.

NEMO
Ha ha ha ha!

======================================================================================

CRUSH
All right, we're here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit's comin' up, man!

MARLIN
Where!? I don't see it!

DORY
Right there! I see it! I see it!

MARLIN
You mean the swirling vortex of terror!?

CRUSH
That's it, dude!

MARLIN
Of course it is.

CRUSH
Okay, first: find your exit buddy!

CRUSH
Do you have your exit buddy?

DORY
Yes!

CRUSH
Okay, Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique!

SQUIRT
Good afternoon, we're gonna have a great jump today! Okay, crank a hard cutback as you hit
the wall! There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember: rip it, roll it and
punch it!

MARLIN
It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you're really cute! But I don't
know what you're saying! Say the first thing again!

CRUSH
Okay, Jellyman! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

MARLIN/DORY
Aaaaaaaaaah!!! Weeeeeeeeeeee!!! Whoooooooooooaaaaa!!! Aaaaaaaaaaah!!! Woohoooo!!!
Whoooooaaa!!!

DORY
Whoooo!

MARLIN

                                             40

Ha ha ha ha! That was..fun! Ha ha! I actually enjoyed that!

DORY
Hey, look! Turtles!

CRUSH
Ha ha! Most excellent! Now, turn your fishy tails 'round and swim straight on through
to Sydney! No worries, man!

MARLIN
No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!

TURTLE KIDS
Bye! Bye, Jellyman!

CRUSH
You tell your little dude I said 'hi', okay?

SQUIRT
See you later, dudes!

DORY
Bye, everyone!

MARLIN
Oh, Nemo would've loved this. Hey, ooh! Hey, Crush! Crush, I forgot! How old are you?

CRUSH
Hundred and fifty, dude! And still young! Rock on!

MARLIN
Hundred and fifty! Hundred and fifty, I gotta remember that.

DORY
Whoa. We goin' in there?

MARLIN
Yup.

DORY
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

MARLIN
Yup. We're gonna just swim straight.

DORY
[singing] Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.

MARLIN
Dory?

======================================================================================

MARLIN
Boy, this is taking a while.

DORY
Hey, how about we play a game?

MARLIN
Okay.

DORY
Uh, okay. I'm thinking of something, uh, orange. And it's small..

MARLIN
It's me.

DORY
Right. Okay..

DORY
..orange, and uh, small..

MARLIN
It's me.


                                               41

DORY
All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants.

DORY
..orange and small, and white stripes..

MARLIN
Me. And the next one's just a guess: me.

DORY
Okay, that's just scary.

MARLIN
W-w-wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it
before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight!

DORY
Hey. Hey!

MARLIN
We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me!
Wha--?

DORY
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

MARLIN
Oh, fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here!

DORY
Well, there has to be someone. It's the ocean, silly, we're not the only two in here.
Let's see...okay, no one there. Uhh, nope. Nada. [gasps] There's somebody. Hey! Excuse--

MARLIN
Dory! Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.
It's a fish we don't know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out
our bones!

DORY
What is it with men and asking for directions?

MARLIN
Look, I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the
'Let's Not Die' card.

DORY
You wanna get outta here, don't you?

MARLIN
Of course, I do.

DORY
Well then, how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? Hmmm?
Hmmmm!? Come on, trust me on this.

MARLIN
All right.

DORY
Excuse me! Woohoo! Little fella? Hello. Don't be rude, say 'hi'.

MARLIN
Ha..hello.

DORY
His son Bingo..

MARLIN
Nemo.

DORY
..Nemo, was taken to, uh..

MARLIN
Sydney.

DORY

                                             42

Sydney. Yes. And it's really, really important that we get there as fast as we can. So can
you help us out? Come on, little fella. Come on.

MARLIN
Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella.

DORY
Oh. Oh, oh, big fella. Big fe--whale. Okay. Maybe he only speaks whale.
MOOOOO-WEEEEEEE-NEEEEED...

MARLIN
Uh, Dory..what're you doing?

DORY
TOOOOOOO-FIIIIIIND...

MARLIN
What're you doing?

DORY
HIS-SOOOOOOOOOOOON...

MARLIN
Are you sure you speak whale?

DORY
CAN-YOOOOOOOUUU-GIIIIIIIIIVE-USSSS-DIRECTIOOOOOOOONS-TOOOOOOOOO...

MARLIN
Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away.

DORY
COOOME-BAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!

MARLIN
He's not coming back. You offended him.

DORY
Maybe a different dialect. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOAAAAAAAAAA..!

MARLIN
Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach.

DORY
Maybe I should try humpback.

MARLIN
No, don't try humpback.

DORY
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOO!!! WAAAAAAAAAOOOOOO!!!

MARLIN
Okay, you actually sound sick.

DORY
Maybe louder, huh? RAAAH!!! RAAAAH!!!

MARLIN
Don't do that!

DORY
Too much orca. Didn't it sound a little orca-ish?

MARLIN
It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!

DORY
MOOOO..MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

MARLIN
It's just as well, he might be hungry.

DORY
Don't worry. Whales don't eat clownfish, they eat krill.

KRILL

                                             43

Swim away!

DORY
Oh, look. Krill.

MARLIN
Move, Dory! Move!

DORY
Aah-aaah! Aaaaaaaaaah!

======================================================================================

GILL
Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to
you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning!

JACQUES
I am ashamed.

PEACH
Hey, look. Scum angel.

GURGLE
Aah! Aaaah! Ooh-ooh! Aaaaah!

PEACH
Nine o' clock and cue dentist.

DENTIST
Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

PEACH
Okay. Okay, here we go. Here we go, okay.

DENTIST
Little Davey Reynolds.

PEACH
Okay. Walks to the counter, drops the keys..

GURGLE
Bloat, that's disgusting!

BLOAT
Tastes pretty good to me. [belch]

GURGLE
Eww! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own--

PEACH
Shhh! Here he comes.

DENTIST
Crikey, what a state. Oh. Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow?

BARBARA
Uh, ten 'o clock, luv.

DENTIST
Leave it open, would you? I gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.

GILL
He he! Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

NEMO
Yay! He's gonna clean the tank! He's gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean!

GILL
Are you ready to see your dad, kid?


                                               44

NEMO
Uh-huh.

GILL
Of course you are. Y'know, I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbor
waitin' for you right now.

NEMO
Yeah.

======================================================================================

MARLIN
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Ooof!

DORY
Ha~~haaa~~haaaaaaah! Whooo!

MARLIN
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

DORY
Here comes a big one--whooooooo! Come on, you gotta try this!

MARLIN
Would you just stop it!?

DORY
Why? What's wrong?

MARLIN
We're in a whale! Don't you get it!?

DORY
A whale?

MARLIN
A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here!

DORY
Wow. A whale. You know I speak whale.

MARLIN
No, you're insane! You can't speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son!
I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! [sobs]

DORY
Woo-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hoo! Hey. You okay?

DORY
There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay.

MARLIN
No. No, it won't.

DORY
Sure it will, you'll see.

MARLIN
No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.

DORY
Huh. That's a funny thing to promise.

MARLIN
What?

DORY
Well, you can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him.
Not much fun for little Harpo.

DORY
Hmm..

MARLIN
What's going on?


                                               45

DORY
I don't know. I'll ask him. MMMWWHAAAAAAAAA! HUUUWHAAAAAAAAA..

MARLIN
Dory. Dory.

MARLIN
..AAAAAAAAAAT'SSS-GOOIIIIIIING..

MARLIN
Dory.

DORY
..OOOOOOOOONNN?

DORY
I think he says we've stopped.

MARLIN
Of course, we've stopped. Just stop trying to speak whale, you're gonna make things worse.
[gasps] What is that noise? Oh no. Look what you did. The water's going down!
It's-it's-it's going down!

DORY
Really? You sure about that?

MARLIN
Look, it's already half-empty!

DORY
Hmm..I'd say it's half full.

MARLIN
Stop that! It's half-empty!

DORY
Okay, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat
or he wants a root beer float.

MARLIN
Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby!? Huh!?
Do I taste good!? You tell him I'm not interested in being lunch!

DORY
Okay. HEEEEEEEEE--

MARLIN
Stop talking to him--waaaah!

DORY
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!

MARLIN
What is going on!?

DORY
I'll check! WHAAAAAAA--!

MARLIN
No! No more whale! You can't speak whale!

DORY
Yes, I can!

MARLIN
No, you can't! You think you could do these things but you can't, Nemo!

DORY
Okay.

MARLIN
Dory!

DORY
He says it's time to let go! Everything's gonna be all right!

MARLIN

                                             46

How do you know!? How do you know something bad isn't gonna happen!?

DORY
I don't!

MARLIN/DORY
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

MARLIN
Ha ha ha! We're alive!

DORY
Look! Sy-d-ney..Sydney! Uh, Sydney! Sydney again!

MARLIN
You were right, Dory! We made it! We're gonna find my son!

MARLIN
THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANK-YOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUU-SIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!

DORY
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

MARLIN
Okay. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him.

DORY
Right!

MARLIN
Come on, Dory. We can do this!

======================================================================================

Whoops. That would've been a nasty fall.

NEMO

Don't let me go belly up!

You won't go belly up, I promise. You're gonna be okay.

MARLIN
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere! Come on, Dory, we're gonna find it.

DORY
I'm totally excited. [yawn] Are you excited? [yawn]

MARLIN
Dory, wake up, wake up. Come on.

Hop in your mouth, huh? And how does that make me live?

GULL

Hey! Hey, wait a minute. W-w-wait! Where are you going?

It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone and I'm going home now.

DORY
No..no, you can't! Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No  one's ever stuck with me for
so long before. And if you leave, if you leave...I just,  I remember things better with you.
I do. Look, P. Sherman, 42..40..2..agh! I remember it, I  do. It's there, I know it is
because when I look at you, I can feel it. And I, I look  at you and...I'm home. Please.

NEMO
Hundred and fifty?

MARLIN
Yep.

NEMO
'Cause Sandy Plankton said they only live to be a hundred.

MARLIN
Sandy Plankton? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as
Sandy Plankton!?

NEMO
Ha ha ha ha!

MARLIN
He was a hundred and fifty! Not one hundred! Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything?

======================================================================================

Fletch - by Phil Alden Robinson from a draft by Andrew Bergman.  May 4, 1986 draft
 




 
  May 4, 1986 PRODUCERS:PETER DOUGLAS ALAN GREISMAN DIRECTOR:MICHAEL RITCHIE   FLETCH Final Draft Screenplay by PHIL ALDEN ROBINSON From a Draft by ANDREW BERGMAN Based on the novel by GREGORY MC DONALD   FLETCH FADE IN EXT.CALIFORNIA BEACH  DAY 1 Seagulls squawk, and the waves pound, but were not talking about Malibu Colony, here. This is a fairly rundown beach area, catering to lower-echelon surfers, vagrants, and strung out druggies of all ages, several of whom stand or sit on their haunches by a dilapidated old hamburger stand. Over the stand is a faded sign: "FAT SAMS HAMBURGERS". A simple but haunting electronic melody plays in the b.g. INT. "FAT SAMS"  DAY 2 Seated just inside the stand on a folding aluminum chair is a chubby man in his late thirties. Hes wearing a stained valor sweat suit and a cap. This is Fat Sam. Hes a dealer. Seated on the sand next to him is Fletch, a rangy man, early thirties, in jeans and a Magic Johnson T-shirt, nodding idly on a battered Casio music machine which he treats lovingly. This is the source of the title music. FLETCH So what do you figure? FAT SAM No idea. FLETCH No idea at all? FAT SAM Okay. Some idea. FLETCH Like when? FAT SAM Like tonight. FLETCH For sure? FAT SAM No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some $hit? FLETCH I think Id rather have drugs. CONTINUED FAT SAM (shakes head and smiles) Fletch FLETCH Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, dont you? A young junkie with a black eye  Gummy  passes. GUMMY Hi Sam. Hi Fletch. FLETCH Hi Gummy. Hows the eye? GUMMY Its okay. The cops did it. FLETCH I know. GUMMY They busted me last week. FLETCH They bust you every week. GUMMY I know. I got bad luck or something. Gummy exits. Fletch and Fat Sam watch him go. FLETCH That kid spends any more time in jail Hell have to start paying rent. WIDER ANGLE THROUGH BINOCULARS Fat Sam and Fletch conclude their conversation. Fletch walks back among the drifters, the nervous, expectant junkies. He stops to talk to a young man propped up on his elbows on a towel.    Creasy. 4      CREASY AND FLETCH   FLETCH Maybe tonight?   CREASY Whaddyamean 'maybe'?   FLETCH That's what he said.   CREASY (getting desperate) He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?   FLETCH I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.   CREASY Sonofabitch.   FLETCH Wonder who his supplier is.   CREASY I have no idea.   FLETCH I wasn't asking.   CREASY He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam.    Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk.    Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk.    So where does it come from? Through the sand?   FLETCH I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.   CREASY (rolls over) I ought to get some sleep.   FLETCH Creasy, how old are you?   CREASY Nineteen.   FLETCH (a touch of sadness) You're not taking real good care of yourself. 5        WIDER - BINOCULARS AGAIN               ---Fletch takes his Casio and starts off the beach.    The binocular angle follows ---him.    A pelican crosses the water.    The binoculars move off Fletch and ---follow the flight of the pelican as it swoops low over the ocean.   6        BEACH PARKING LOT - DAY              ---Fletch emerges into view, walking towards camera, when a Man steps into the ---immediate f.g., the binoculars at his side large in frame.    Fletch Stops.   MAN Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.   FLETCH What? 7        REVERSE ---A trim man of approximately Fletch's age, wearing a perfectly tailored grey ---suit, is standing across from Fletch.    This is Alan Stanwyk.   STANWYK We can't talk about it here. 8        MASTER   FLETCH Why not?   STANWYK Because we can't. FLETCH Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?   STANWYK I want you to come to my house.    Then we'll talk.   FLETCH I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.   STANWYK I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition.     If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.   FLETCH Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?   STANWYK (unsmiling, all business) It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you. (Takes a thousand in cash from his pocket) One thousand, just to listen.I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...   FLETCH Nugent.    Ted Nugent.   STANWYK (shakes his hand) Alan Stanwyk.   FLETCH Charmed. 9 EXT. BERMAN STREET - BEVERLY HILLS - DAY ---A Jaguar XJ sedan goes up Berman Street, a dead end. Fletch's hand reaches out ---of the passenger window and empties sand out of a sneaker. 10 INT. JAGURE - DAY FLETCH I always liked this part of town. 11 EXT. BERMAN STREET - DAY ---The Jaguar continues on up Berman Street, stopping before massive iron gates ---marked PRIVATE PROPERTY -- NO TRESPASSING -- STANWYK. The gates open ---electronically. 12 EXT. STANWYK HOUSE - DAY ---The jaguar goes up the center of the drive toward a white-pillared mansion. The ---lawns and planting are spectacular. 13 INT. JAGUAR - DAY ---Fletch stares out the window. FLETCH What a coincidence. ---The car stops before the house. STANWYK What? 14 EXT. HOUSE - DAY ---as they get out of the car. FLETCH I came this close... (holds fingers slightly apart) ...to buying this place ---Stanwyk ignores Fletch and starts toward the house. Fletch follows. FLETCH Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me. STANWYK Who? FLETCH Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange. ---Stanwyk stops before the front door, stares at Fletch STANWYK What are you, doped up or something? ---Fletch abruptly changes gears, stares at Stanwyk FLETCH I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that. STANWYK (after a beat) Come inside. 15 INT. HOUSE - DAY ---Stanwyk and Fletch enter. A Mexican Maid crosses. STANWYK Buenas dias. MAID Buenas dias. She disappeared. FLETCH I commend you on your Spanish. ---Stanwyk doesn't reply, keeps on walking. He opens a set of double doors to the ---left of the winding staircase, then stands to one side, indicating that Fletch ---should enter. 16 INT. LIBRARY - DAY ---Massive fireplace. Everything built in teak. Fletch enters, and Stanwyk closes ---the door behind them. FLETCH Ahh, the library. Masculine but sensitive. ---Stanwyk wordlessly goes behind the desk FLETCH Really, I love what you've done with the place. Must have cost you...hundreds. ---Stanwyk turns, looks out a pair of French doors behind his desk, then turns ---back. STANWYK Here's my proposition, Mr. Fletcher. FLETCH I'm all ears. STANWYK I want you to murder me. 17 thru OMITTED 19 20 FLETCH ---Even garrulous Fletch is stopped in his tracks by this remark, uttered in the ---most business-like manner. 21 STANWYK STANWYK Here. On Thursday. I'd like you to shoot me dead. 22 FLETCH ---He just stares, barely breathing. 23 STANWYK STANWYK The reason I ask you to do me this service is that I am facing a long, painful, and most certain death. You see, I have bone cancer. I don't know if you know anything about bone cancer. 24 FLETCH ---He shakes his head. 25 STANWYK STANWYK It doesn't get any worse than that. Just eats you up, bit by bit. FLETCH ---Finally regains the gift of speech. FLETCH You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk. 27 MASTER STANWYK I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it. FLETCH Why don't you try suicide? STANWYK My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not. FLETCH So why pick me? STANWYK You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks. FLETCH Maybe I'm just on vacation. STANWYK Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you. FLETCH Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you? STANWYK I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will. 28 FLETCH ---He chews his lip. 29 STANWYK STANWYK Fifty thousand and a guarantee you won't get caught. ---Stanwyk searches Fletch's face carefully for a reaction. After several beats.... FLETCH I'm still here. STANWYK (turns and goes to the French doors) I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off. (pushes doors open) These will be open. 30 FLETCH FLETCH Wouldn't they normally be locked? 31 MASTER STANWYK Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets. FLETCH I have the same problem with my help. STANWYK (goes on, unresponsive) I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves? FLETCH I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy. STANWYK In this drawer.... ---He opens the top drawer of his desk 32 INSIDE THE DRAWER ---an enormous .357 Magnum. 33 MASTER ---Stanwyk holds up the gun. 34 FLETCH FLETCH A .357. 35 MASTER STANWYK Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray. FLETCH So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you. STANWYK Precisely. Are you a good shot? FLETCH (looking at the huge gun) What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first. STANWYK Get me on the first shot, if you can. FLETCH I don't think you'll have to worry about that. ---A beat. Stanwyk stares at Fletch. STANWYK Do you have a passport? FLETCH Sure, all drifters do. STANWYK Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment. FLETCH Take it where? ---Stanwyk starts to write down the information on a note pad. STANWYK LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you. FLETCH Where am I going? STANWYK (hands Fletch the note) Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM. FLETCH They serve dinner on the flight? STANWYK It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Fletcher. FLETCH You've certainly thought this out, haven't you? STANWYK I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Fletcher. FLETCH You sure those doors will be open? STANWYK Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else. FLETCH The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying. STANWYK That's right. FLETCH You sure got the hard part. STANWYK What do you say, Mr. Fletcher? You'll be doing me and my family a great service. 36 FLETCH ---thinking it over. 37 STANWYK STANWYK Will you kill me? 38 FLETCH FLETCH Sure. 39 INT. NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DAY Fletch pushes through the double glass doors, still dresses in a beach mufti -- the jeans and Magic Johnson shirt, Puma sneakers. 40 INT. L.A. NEWS OFFICE - DAY Fletch is greeted ad-lib by several people as he walks through the cavernous newspaper City Room. REPORTER Whoa, check out the beach boy! SECOND REPORTER Looking very good, Fletch. FLETCH Thank you so much (to someone else) Hey, Larry! Larry, the young "morgue" researcher, hurries over and walks with Fletch. She is fun and flirty, and her feelings for Fletch fall just short of idolatry. LARRY Yo! FLETCH Can I steal you for a minute? LARRY Only if you promise not to return me. FLETCH Deal. LARRY (pointing to Fletch's T-shirt) 'Magic' today, huh? FLETCH Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor. LARRY Shoot. FLETCH Don't say shoot, okay. They pass the office of the city editor Frank Walker, fiftyish. Hold on Walker's office. Upon noticing Fletch, he jumps from his seat, edges his way past the two reporters in his office and runs outside. WALKER Fletch. Fletch! 40-A FLETCH AND LARRY They continue their walk. FLETCH Did you hear something? LARRY Not me. FLETCH Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away. WALKER (running up to them) Fletch, I take it by your presence here that the story is done. Tell me I'm right. Fletch hold up a hand. FLETCH W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute. LARRY No problem, boss. Larry peels off and Fletch now talks to Walker without breaking stride for his office. WALKER Fletch. FLETCH Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit? WALKER No, I want an answer, Is the story done? FLETCH Uh, almost. WALKER 'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer. FLETCH (as he enters his cubicle) And a damn fine one, I might add. 41 INT. FLETCH'S CUBICLE - DAY A pile of mail is on his desk. On the walls are a team portrait of the Lakers, plus a couple of blow-ups of his column. Fletch writes under the name of Jane Doe. An unused word processor is on his desk, but the keyboard has been moved aside to make room for an old, much-used Royal typewriter. He bounces some waste paper off the monitor into a strategically placed waste can. (A lot of crumpled papers lie on the floor all around the can.) FLETCH Two.... WALKER Irwin.... FLETCH Oh, I hate it when he calls me that. WALKER Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story! FLETCH I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay? WALKER No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday? FLETCH I never read the paper. WALKER ...never reads the paper... Walker goes through a pile of unread newspapers on Fletch's desk, finds the Sunday paper. FLETCH What's the spread on the game tonight? WALKER I don't know. (holds up paper) Look! FLETCH Looks great. 42 INSERT - AD A full-page ad. NEXT WEEK A "JANE DOE" SPECIAL REPORT: DRUGS ON OUR BEACHES - SHAME OF THE CITY 43 MASTER FLETCH 'Shame of Our City' is so good. WALKER Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story. FLETCH Why not? Oh $hit...really? Walker just stares at him. FLETCH Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it. WALKER You broke it? You know the source? FLETCH Practically. 44 WALKER ready to kill. WALKER What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him.... 45 MASTER FLETCH I have pictures of him. Dealing.... WALKER So let's go! We run the pictures. FLETCH He's not the story! There's a source behind him. WALKER Who? FLETCH Well, there we're in a gray area. WALKER How gray? FLETCH I'd say charcoal. WALKER (straining for control) I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that? FLETCH Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God. (to himself as he exits) I hope. INSERT - NEWSPAPER CLIPPING ALAN STANWYK NEW V/P BOYD AVIATION A photograph of Stanwyk; a head shot. Hands turn the clipping paper. Next clipping: a social page spread on the wedding of Alan Stanwyk. ("GAIL BOYD WED TO ALAN STANWYK.") LARRY (V.O.) Everything's recent. 47 FLETCH AND LARRY Fletch and Larry examine the file. FLETCH 'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.' LARRY Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin. 48 INSERT - CLIPPING - TIGHTER ANGLE FLETCH (V.O.) 'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.' 49 FLETCH AND LARRY LARRY (affected accent) Not our kind of people, you understand. FLETCH (points to his back) Spot right here. She scratches. FLETCH Thanks. LARRY You doing a story on this guy? FLETCH Maybe. He pours over some more clippings, then stops at one. 50 INSERT CLIPPING headlined: "CANCER SOCIETY BENEFIT". A photograph of Alan and Gail Stanwyk, with a gray haired man and his wife. FLETCH (V.O.) '...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen. 51 FLETCH AND LARRY FLETCH I wonder if that's his doctor. LARRY Only one way to find out. 52 INT. DOCTOR'S EXAMINING ROOM - DAY Fletch, stripped to the waist. is being examined by Dr. Joseph Dolen, a rather imperious physician. DR. DOLEN So where do you know Alan from? FLETCH We play tennis at the club. DR. DOLEN Really. The California Racquet Club? FLETCH Yes. DR. DOLEN That's my club too. I haven't seen you there. FLETCH Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains. DR. DOLEN Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber? FLETCH That's Babar. DR. DOLEN Two bs? FLETCH One. B-a-b-a-r. DR. DOLEN That's two. FLETCH But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant. DR. DOLEN Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar? FLETCH I don't know. I don't have any. DR. DOLEN No children? FLETCH No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books. DR. DOLEN (eyes Fletch curiously) Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry. Fletch's eyes drift to Dolen's side table with its unnerving assortment of medical paraphernalia. FLETCH Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt. DR. DOLEN Your aunt? FLETCH Mrs. Smith. DR. DOLEN Joan or Margaret Smith. FLETCH Right. DR. DOLEN Well, which one? FLETCH Margaret. DR. DOLEN Funny old bird. FLETCH Is she ever. I've got some stories.... DR. DOLEN I'll bet. Shame about Ed. FLETCH (vamping) It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly. DR. DOLEN Oh, he was dying for years. FLETCH Sure, but the end was so sudden. DR. DOLEN He was in intensive care for eight weeks. FLETCH Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden. (quickly) You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy. DR. DOLEN Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar. FLETCH Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that.... DR. DOLEN Just relax.... FLETCH Honest, I feel fine. You better be married. Fletch looks alarmed as Dolan pushes him into position. Dolan puts on a plastic glove. 53 CLOSE - FLETCH FLETCH Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh -- (as Dolan starts to probe from behind) Ever serve time? DR. DOLEN Breathe easy.... FLETCH Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family. DR. DOLEN (noncommittally) There is? FLETCH Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist? DR. DOLEN Just relax. FLETCH (reacts to a poke) Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right? DR. DOLEN I can't discuss another patient. You know that. (rising into frame and washing up) Well, I can't find anything wrong with you. FLETCH I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you? DR. DOLEN Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now. FLETCH I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove? DR. DOLEN Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements. FLETCH Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant. 54 INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - DAY Fletch is dressed in shorts, a clean shirt, and is carrying a doctor's bag. He is wearing a stethoscope around his neck , has a beeper on, a lot of pencils and other doctor gadgets. He's standing at the directory 55 DIRECTORY Combing it with his eyes, he sees the directory: PATHOLOGY - THIRD FLOOR B. ROSENSTIEN, M.D. H. ROSENBLATT, M.D. P. ROSENWOHL, M.D. Fletch goes to a door marked "Stairs." 56 INT. STAIRWELL - DAY Fletch abruptly empties his doctor's bag and puts on a long green gown, a cap and a face mask. He plugs the stethoscope in his ears, removes miscellaneous file folders filled with papers, closes the bag, and heads for Pathology. 57 INT PATHOLOGY DEPARTMENT - DAY It's at the end of a long hall, and adjacent to the Autopsy Room and the Pathology Records Room. Over his shoulder we can see into the autopsy room where a gowned doctor is happily performing an autopsy. RECORDS NURSE (to Fletch) Identification please. Fletch hastily fumbles through his wallet, deftly dropping and picking up the papers he has brought with him. FLETCH It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place? RECORDS NURSE (confused at all his activity) Nothing. They're still there. FLETCH Right. Fine. Still dropping and picking up, shuffling and collating, Fletch starts toward the Files Room, when the doctor performing the autopsy yells at him. PATHOLOGIST Hey you! Fletch stiffens and turns around. PATHOLOGIST Give me a hand for a second would you doctor? Fletch hesitates. PATHOLOGIST Come on, come on. Reluctantly, he goes to the autopsy table, and the cadaver thereon, which is covered by a sheet, except for the mid-section. 58 TWO SHOT - FLETCH AND PATHOLOGIST (Note: from here on we never see the body.) PATHOLOGIST (poking around) Have you ever see a spleen this large? FLETCH (trying not to look) Not recently. PATHOLOGIST Grab this, will you? FLETCH Uh, I'm not really prepared. My hands aren't sterilized. PATHOLOGIST You're not going to make this guy any sicker. We hear a squishing noise as he grabs something large and wet and plops it into Fletch's hand. Fletch stands there holding something icky out of frame, looking uncomfortably up at the ceiling, the floor, anywhere but at the cadaver or at the stuff in his hand. Meanwhile, we hear sounds of further incisions, and the deflating of an organ. PATHOLOGIST You never really get used to the smell, do you? Fletch's eyes roll up, and he falls to the floor in a dead faint. 59 INT. RECORDS ROOM - DAY - MINUTES LATER Fletch is on a couch, beginning to regain consciousness. The Records Nurse hovers over him. RECORDS NURSE Are you all right, Doctor? FLETCH Where am I? RECORDS NURSE You're in the Records Room. FLETCH I'm fine. RECORDS NURSE Can I get you something? FLETCH Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding. RECORDS NURSE Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted. FLETCH Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother. RECORDS NURSE Oh my God! FLETCH It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image. He sits up and sees that just outside the glass is none other that Dr. Joseph Dolen, talking with the pathologist. FLETCH Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something. RECORDS NURSE Yes, right away. She goes to get the paper bag, and Fletch turns his back on Dr. Dolen to go through the file cabinet. By the time the Nurse returns, he's got Stanwyk's file. RECORDS NURSE Here you are, Doctor. FLETCH Thank you. He puts the bag over his mouth and breathes deeply as he continues the conversation with her. (From time to time, we see Dr. Dolen in the b.g. looking over, but does not come into the records room or question what's happening). RECORDS NURSE Is there anything particular you're looking for? FLETCH My associates did a biopsy on this man recently. (thumbs through file) He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it. RECORDS NURSE (taking the file) Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here. (searches) Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign. FLETCH That's it? RECORDS NURSE (shows him the file) That's it. FLETCH (reading it) This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer. RECORDS NURSE I guess not. FLETCH (very puzzled) He'll be so relieved. 60 EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET - LATE AFTERNOON Fletch pulls up in front of his building, a 1970's cinderblock apartment complex. Fletch parks his car halfway up the curb, gets out and spots a Mercedes coupe. He starts running toward the rear of his building. 61 EXT. REAR OF THE BUILDING - DAY Fletch starts climbing up the fire escape of his building. 62 FIRE ESCAPE - DAY Fletch reaches the second floor. He's huffing and puffing. FLETCH Christ. 63 REVERSE Attorney Charles Gillett is waiting for him on the second floor fire escape. Gillett smiles. GILLETT Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch. 64 MASTER FLETCH What about breaking and entering? (points to Gillett's coat) Are you wearing anything under that? GILLETT I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband. FLETCH I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside. Fletch takes out a credit card and jimmies open the lock on the window. 65 INT. FLETCH'S APARTMENT - DAY Fletch climbs in through the window, followed by Gillett. His small apartment is just barely furnished. A low basketball hoop is attached to the wall. Fletch takes a ball, offers it to Gillett. FLETCH One on one? Gillett shakes his head. Fletch does a reverse shot and misses, sending a plastic globe lamb crashing to the floor. FLETCH And the foul. Fletch takes a second, successful shot. GILLETT You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars. FLETCH (still playing b-ball) She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it. GILLETT I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence. FLETCH It stinks. I thought woman were independent now. GILLETT Until she remarries, Fletch. FLETCH Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this. GILLETT I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out. FLETCH She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that.... GILLETT You should have proved that in a court of law. FLETCH My lawyer was a bum. GILLETT (smiles) I agree. Fletch puts down the basketball, picks up a stack of mail and rifles through it. FLETCH I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too. GILLETT You may be right. FLETCH Are you serious? GILLETT (shrugs) That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars. FLETCH Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved. Fletch holds up an envelope with Ed McMahon's picture on it. FLETCH (continuing) I think I just won a million dollars! He opens it and looks inside, feigning disappointment. FLETCH (continuing) Damn...lost again. Sorry. GILLETT This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages. Fletch sighs, takes out the envelope given to him by Stanwyk. He hands a thousand dollars to Gillett. GILLETT Cash. I'm impressed. FLETCH Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month. GILLETT Till then. Gillett smiles and exits. 66 KITCHEN - DAY Fletch opens the fridge. Inside are tow six-packs of Coors, a jar of Miracle Whip, a half a cucumber, and a brown head of lettuce. Fletch takes a beer and slams the door shut with such force that we hear breakage inside. 67 MASTER - APARTMENT - DAY In a foul mood, Fletch leaves the kitchen, and wanders into the living room. It has the personality of an Abbey Rents. He picks up the TV remote control. The television clicks on. Chick Hearn is with Jabbar, during a Laker pregame warmup. FLETCH Thank God. Fletch settles back. 68 TELEVISION Hearn is gushing over Jabbar. 69 FLETCH He watches contemplatively. He is bone tired. 70 TELIVISION HEARN How about Fletch? JABBAR Well, Fletch has been great. He's super-strong, really clogs the middle for us, boxes out, gets the bounds.... 71 FLETCH He smiles and nods, deep in fantasy. 72 TELEVISION HEARN Now here's a key play in Tuesday night's game.... Hearn and Jabbar look down at a television monitor. 73 FLETCH He's half asleep. JABBAR (V.O.) Here I am dishing off to Fletch.... Fletch raises an eyebrow. 74 TELEVISION There's Fletch, his hair in an Afro, dressed in Laker gold. He's on the receiving end of a Jabbar pass, making an easy layup. HEARN (V.O.) Gosh, he makes it look so easy! 75 FLETCH asleep, smiling. 77 PRICATICE COURT - DAY Gail Stanwyk is on the other side of the net, loading tennis balls into the automatic serve machine. She is in her late twenties and quite attractive., but in a much more natural way than other women we see here. She is good natured and effervescent. Fletch steps up to the entrance of the court. FLETCH Gail Stanwyk! She looks up. He enters the court with great delight. FLETCH (continuing) I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great. MRS. STANWYK (genuinely pleased) I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are. FLETCH Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours. MRS. STANWYK Oh, mine! Thank God. (furrows her brow) Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's? FLETCH We used to fly together. I'm...John. MRS. STANWYK (snaps her fingers in happy recognition) John! You used to fly together! Her smile segues right into an "I'm sorry, bit I give up" expression. MRS. STANWYK John who? FLETCH John Ultrarelamensky. MRS. STANWYK (bursts out in laughter) Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really. FLETCH It's Scotch-Rumanian. MRS. STANWYK (still loading tennis balls) That's a strange combination. FLETCH So were my parents. MRS. STANWYK Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little. FLETCH Please. As Mrs. Stanwyk crosses to the other side of the net, a waiter approaches Fletch. WAITER Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club? FLETCH Yes, I'm with the Underhills. WAITER They just left, sir. FLETCH They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis. WAITER Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill. FLETCH Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich. WAITER Very good sir. The Waiter leaves, and Fletch watches as Mrs. Stanwyk tries to return the serving machine's serves. She swings so goofily that she can't even get the racket on the ball. She has clearly never taken a lesson in her life, and it is doubtful if she will ever make contact with a tennis ball in this century. MRS. STANWYK Damn, I thought I had that one. FLETCH You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan? MRS. STANWYK What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied. FLETCH Preoccupied with what? MRS. STANWYK Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one! Indeed, she has. Strait up. She and Fletch crane their necks upward to follow it's flight. FLETCH Good. Lobs are a very important part of the game. She completely misses the next one. FLETCH Why do you keep doing this? MRS STANWYK I love the outfits. The next one she hits with the handle. FLETCH Try stepping into the ball with your left foot. He demonstrates a swing. She puts on a determined face, makes an awkward step and swings at the next ball, missing it completely, and letting the racket fly. FLETCH There, much better. Mrs. Stanwyk laughs happily and dodges the machine-served balls to walk over to Fletch. When she's almost up to him, she turns back to the serving machine and points a finger at it, as if addressing a pet dog. MRS STANWYK Stay! (to Fletch) I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player. FLETCH I have this effect on lots of women. MRS STANWYK I bet you do. FLETCH Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out? MRS STANWYK (catching him in his lie) Alan's in Utah. FLETCH (after a beat) I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning. MRS STANWYK Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you? FLETCH (thinks, then nods) I'm such a heel. How'd you guess? MRS STANWYK If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman. FLETCH You are a rich woman. MRS STANWYK See what I mean? She trots back to her ball machine. Fletch calls after her. FLETCH What's he doing in Utah? MRS STANWYK None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off. Fletch chuckles -- he likes this woman -- and exits. 78 BOYD AVIATION - DAY - ESTABLISHING A sprawling, Hughes-like complex. FLETCH (O.S.) ...then who walks in but George Bush. He took one look around the room... 79 INT. JOHN BOYD'S OFFICE - DAY A Secretary is serving coffee to Fletch (now dressed in a three piece suit) and John Boyd, Gail Stanwyk's father. At seventy, he is probably Chairman Emeritus now; no longer running the day-to-day operations of the company, and thus somewhat grateful from the company. FLETCH (continuing) ...and said 'Sorry Mr. President, I thought it was Saturday.' Boyd Laughs. FLETCH I thought I was going to die. SECRETARY Sugar, Mr. Poon? FLETCH Thank you. Fletch notices a framed wedding photograph on the credenza behind Boyd. It is of Alan and Gail Stanwyk, Alan beaming a $hit-eating grin and holding a happy thumbs-up. Fletch waits as the Secretary leaves the room, then begins speaking confidentially. FLETCH Okay. He opens his attache case, allowing Boyd to see an airline ticket, a Washington Post, and a file stenciled "Confidential/S.E.C. Use only." FLETCH First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --- BOYD Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --- Fletch is nodding sympathetically and holds up a quieting hand. Boyd stops in mid-tirade, and watches as Fletch reaches into his briefcase and seemingly turns off a tape recorder. FLETCH Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats. BOYD Unbelievable. FLETCH I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah? BOYD Utah? (laughs) Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face. FLETCH (stands and closes briefcase) God I admire you. BOYD By the way: what kind of name is Poon? FLETCH Comanche Indian. 80 ALAN STANWYK'S OFFICE - DAY Fletch breezes in, right up to the Secretary, whose nameplate reads MADELINE TURNER. FLETCH (rapidly) Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick? MARGIE Jim Swarthout? FLETCH Yeah. She writes it out for him. MARGIE And, I'm sorry, who are you again? FLETCH (grabbing the paper) Frieda's boss. MARGIE (calling after him) Who's Frieda? FLETCH (out the door) My secretary. 81 EXT. BEACH - DAY Pan across the beach.... FLETCH (O.S.) Larry, it's me.... Fletch is in a phone booth on the sidewalk next to the beach, keeping an eye on "Fat Sam's." FLETCH See if you've got anything in Stanwyk's background from when he lived in Utah. Also check on a realtor in Provo named Swarthout. And tell Frank I'm crazy about him and I'd like to discuss his maybe moving in with me. We hear police sirens. Fletch looks O.S. FLETCH Later. He hangs up. 82 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - FOUR SQUAD CARS have pulled up to the beach, lights flashing. The druggies are dispersing. Creasy is running towards Fletch. CREASY Fletch! Take off! 83 FLETCH He steps out onto the beach, and starts towards the cops. 84 MASTER CREASY What are you doing? 85 MASTER Everyone is scattering. The cops run past everyone, and approach Gummey. 86 FLETCH AND CREASY FLETCH They're after Gummy again. It's weird. Fletch keeps moving toward the police. CREASY (out of breath) Fletch, slow down. 87 GUMMY AND THE COPS Gummy trips and falls in the sand. A Cop kicks him in the head. COP #1 Let's go, Gummy. 88 FLETCH AND CREASY still running toward the cops. FLETCH Hey, what are you doing? CREASY Fletch, this is dumb. FLETCH You don't have to run with me, Crease. 89 MASTER The cops drag Gummy toward a squad car. 90 ANGLE - "FAT SAM'S" Fat Sam peers out, watching the action. 91 MASTER Fletch approaches the cops. FLETCH Why are you beating up on that kid? No responce from the cops. FLETCH He's defenseless, and you kick the crap out of him. What do you want from --- One of the cops turns and, in one smooth motion, kicks Fletch in the balls. Fletch sinks to the ground. 92 SQUAD CAR Gummy is packed into the squad car. 93 FLETCH He rises slowly from the sand. He is in great pain. He starts after the cops again. 94 CREASY CREASY Fletch! 95 MASTER FLETCH What goddamn right do you have to take him? The cop car starts off. Fletch picks up a rock, hurls it at the cop car. It smashes the rear window. 96 CREASY CREASY Fletch!!! 97 MASTER The cop cars go off. Fletch bends over. He's hurting. Creasy comes over to him. CREASY Hey you're really nuts. FLETCH (breathless) They didn't do anything. CREASY What? What are you talking about? FLETCH I busted their window, they didn't do anything. CREASY You're lucky. FLETCH Not luck. They don't want me. 98 POLICE CARS In a caravan, they head down the highway. 99 FLETCH He turns and looks towards "Fat Sam's." 100 "FAT SAM'S" Fat Sam watches the police cars go down the road, then turns and looks towards the ocean. He pulls his Angels cap down over his head. 101 CLOSE - FLETCH He is focusing on something, but has not figured it out yet. FLETCH Gummy and two cops.... 102 and OMITTED 103 104 INT. FRANK WALKER'S OFFICE - DAY FLETCH Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here. WALKER Your onto something. That's good. What? FLETCH I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow? Larry, knocks on the door. WALKER What do you want? Larry points to Fletch. WALKER Speak, don't point! LARRY I need Fletch for a second. FLETCH She needs me, Frank. Fletch turns to Larry. Push to two shot. LARRY Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did --- FLETCH That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while. Larry starts to exit. WALKER Just give me a hint, all right? FLETCH All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this. LARRY (stopping in the doorway) Did you say cops? FLETCH Yeah. LARRY That's one thing I did find. It's from Last month, so it was in the unsorted pile. She hands Fletch a clipping. 105 INSERT - CLIPPING It is an article and photograph of the newly-appointed citizens on the Police Advisory Board. One of them is Alan Stanwyk. WALKER What's that? 106 MASTER Fletch pockets the photo. FLETCH (puzzled) More cops. (then) I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank. WALKER Utah? FLETCH Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures. WALKER What about finding the source? FLETCH I have some ideas. WALKER Who? Donnie and Marie? FLETCH Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt. WALKER Go to transportation, get a ticket. LARRY (to Fletch as he exits) My hero. FLETCH Nothing to it. 107 EXT. PROVO, UTAH - AIRPORT -DAY A Western Airlines flight arrives. 107-A EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK Fletch's rented Fairmont speeds down the highway. 107-B INT. FAIRMONT - FLETCH wearing a polyester brown suit -- fiddles with the radio. Snatches of programs are heard: "easy listening" music; country-and-western; a revival show; a call in show -- "Hi, you're on the air." "Hello, Bob, I'd like to discuss the death penalty. As you know, Jesus was in favor of it --" Fletch whistles and switches the radio off. He turns the car off the interstate. 108 EXT. TRAVELODGE - LATE AFTERNOON - ESTABLISHING SHOT as Fletch drives up. 109 INT. TRAVELODGE MOTEL ROOM Fletch dials the phone in the small, sparsely furnished room. FLETCH Hi, Jim Swarthout, please. Oh, hello, my name is Igor Stravinski and I'm looking for some ranch property. 110 INT. SWARTHOUT REALTY Jim Swarthout is a rugged-looking man in his forties. He sits in the den/office of his house talking on the phone, surrounded by pine-paneling, property tract maps and wall-mounted animal heads. SWARTHOUT Good, Mr. Starinski, what'd you have in mind? (pause) Uh huh. Oh are you a friend of Alan's? 111 INT. FLETCH'S MOTEL ROOM FLETCH No, I just heard some people at the club talking about the property you sold him, and the way it was described, three million sounded like a pretty good price. (pause) What? Fletch pauses again to listen, flummoxed over what he has just heard. FLETCH Are you sure? (pause) Of course. I guess I was misinformed. Listen, I'd love to come out and see you anyway. When are you available? 112 INT. SWARTHOUT REALTY SWARTHOUT Well, I'm about to close up shop and go out for the evening. How about first thing in the AM? (pause) Great. See you tomorrow. 113 INT. FLETCH'S MOTEL ROOM FLETCH Tomorrow. Fletch hangs up, very interested. 114 OMITTED 115 EXT. SWARTHOUT REALTY - NIGHT Fletch stops his car in front of the ranch-style house. A lighted sign in the yard indicate that this is indeed Swarthout Realty, but the house is dark; no one appears to be home. Somewhere in the yard a dog barks viciously, frantically. 116 DOG A killer Doberman is tied up behind a chain link fence. At the sight of the intruding Fletch, the dog's lip is practically over his nose, his fangs are poised and gleaming. 117 FLETCH FLETCH (getting out of his car) What's your name fella? Fluff? Pom-pom? 118 DOG completely bananas. 119 FLETCH Fletch reaches the front door and looks around. He rings the bell. The dog yowls even louder. Fletch waits. And waits. He rings again. Satisfied that no one is home, he tries the front door. Of course, it is locked. He takes out a credit card, starts to jimmy the lock, and actually seems to be making progress when his credit card snaps in half. FLETCH Sh*t. He pockets the broken credit card, steps back and looks over the house for another possible point of entry. 120 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW Double-hung. Slightly warped, so that the upper half does not exactly true with the lower half. 121 FLETCH looks around to see how to climb up to it. 122 MASTER There's only one way. Climb up the side of the chain link fence which separates him from the murderous dog. Fletch approaches it warily. The dog is practically foaming. Fletch reaches out a hand to get a hold of the fence, and the dog just about rips the fence apart. FLETCH (in his best Barbara Woodhouse) Sit-tuh! This has no effect, so Fletch backs up a few yards, take a deep breath for courage and makes a headlong running start for the fence, using his momentum to get to the top before the dog eats him. He grabs hold and scrambles wildly for the top. He makes it. FLETCH Roll over. Play dead. Good boy. Fletch now grabs hold of the eave on the side of the house, and very carefully pulls himself onto it. It's only about ten feet from there to the vulnerable window, but the angle of the eave is rather steep, and the going is treacherous. As he makes his way, he keeps a wary eye on the dog who keeps leaping up, seemingly getting closer and closer to taking a giant bite out of Fletch's backside. FLETCH You any relation to Doctor Dolan? Now he's at the window. He tries to open it, but despite it's warped appearance from the ground, it is locked. Fletch looks at the lock and can't believe it. He sighs. He shakes his head. He smashes the window with his elbow. FLETCH I hate this. He climbs into the darkened house, leaving the enraged dog to run furiously around the fenced in yard that surrounds the house. 123 INT SWARTHOUT'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT Fletch tiptoes though the upstairs bedroom and down the stairs. From outside, he can still hear the dog snarling and barking. 124 INT. SWARTHOUT'S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT As Fletch passes through the living room he sees the dog snarling at him through the living room window. 125 INT. SWARTHOUT'S DEN - NIGHT Fletch enters and looks around. The dog is now outside the den window. FLETCH Make sure nobody comes in, okay? He goes to the file cabinet and opens it. He flips through the "S" section. "Stanwyk". He pulls it. He thumbs through various documents until he finds what he's looking for. A copy of a deed. He pulls it out. 125-A INSERT - DEED - CLOSE ON THE PURCHASE PRICE Three Thousand Dollars. FLETCH (O.S.) So much for your three million dollar ranch. 126 FLETCH takes out a tiny document camera -- the kind spies use in the movies -- and loads it fumblingly. Then he props the deed up on top of the file cabinet, and moves a lamp into position to light it. Just as he snaps his first shot, we hear a terrible crashing sound. 127 WINDOW The murderous Doberman has made a crashing leap right through the den window, sending glass flying everywhere, and he streaks across the room to rip Fletch into bite-sized shreds. 128 MASTER Fletch bolts and the dog flies into the file cabinet, knocking it over, scattering all the files over the floor. Fletch dashes for the nearest door, and runs through it just as the dog slams into it. 129 INT. KITCHEN Fletch is now holed up in the kitchen, panting to catch his breath, feeling the full course of adrenaline pumping through his terrified veins. He sees that he can get to his car by climbing through the window. But in order to get to the window he has to let go of the door, and that would allow the dog to get in. Looking around frantically, holding the door shut against the furious slamming of the dog, he reaches for and finally grabs a mop which he props under the door knob, thus keeping the door shut. Letting go of the door gingerly, he satisfies himself that the dog cannot get in, and he makes his break for the window. He vaults up onto the counter top and is just about to break the window when he sees that the dog's continued efforts are about to result in opening the door. Fletch knows he has only seconds. Standing on top of the counter, he opens the door of the restaurant-sized refrigerator next to him, and just as the snarling dog bursts into the room Fletch starts hurling food at it. A pot roast, sliced turkey with stuffing, a couple of filet mignons. The dog is momentarily distracted. Fletch pours a large bucket of cranberry sauce on the dog. FLETCH Suck on this Cujo! Then he dumps an equally large bucket of mashed potatoes. With the dog temporarily vision-impaired, Fletch bolts. 130 EXT. SWARTHOUT HOUSE - NIGHT Fletch runs as fast as humanly possible towards his car, fishing for his keys as he goes. The dog -- having shaken off the people-food from his hateful face -- is seconds behind and closing. Fletch makes it to his car, hops inside, and slams the door just as the dog leaps furiously at the windshield. 131 INT. FLETCH'S CAR Fletch makes it to his car, huffing and puffing. The dog jumps across the closed window, snarling and bug-eyed with hatred. Fletch smiles, waves at the dog, and starts taking its picture with his little camera. FLETCH Gimme a smile! There you go...oh, that's a nice one... (starting the car) Everything's fine, now...go take a little nap.... Fletch is ready to pull out, but the dog is still leaping madly at the window. Fletch points back to the house. FLETCH Look! Defenseless babies! The dog turns to look and Fletch guns it. FLETCH That dog is such an A**hole. 132 EXT. FLETCH'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY Fletch parks his car halfway up on the curb, steps out carrying a small overnight bag. He is unshaven and looks beat. 133 INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - CORRIDOR Fletch comes down the hall signing "Billie Jean" is an excruciating falsetto. FLETCH 'Bil-lie, Bil-lie...' He opens the door to his apartment and is immediately thrown to the ground. 134 INT. APARTMENT Fletch is spread-eagled on the floor. Two huge Cops are over him, one holding a gun to his head, the other going through his clothes. COP #1 (feeling the inseam of Fletch's trousers) Oh, what's this? FLETCH If I took that out, you guys couldn't fit in here. COP #1 Funny boy. Look at this.... He produces a heroin bag. COP#2 Looks like heroin, Gene. FLETCH You just planted that. Cop #1 kicks Fletch in the ribs. COP#2 What'd you say? FLETCH Read me my rights. COP #1 Okay. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to be kicked in the face by me. You have the rights to have your balls stomped. You have the --- FLETCH Hold it! I'll waive my rights. 135 EXT. PRECINT HOUSE Fletch is lead into the precinct house. 136 INT. PRECINT HOUSE The Sergeant at the desk checks Fletch out. SERGEANT Who we booking here, gentlemen? COP #1 No booking. Chief wants a talk with the boy. SERGEANT Oh Yeah? (smiles at Fletch) You'll like the Chief. Nice man. FLETCH I hear he's mellowed a lot since he came out of the closet. SERGEANT I find he gets real mellow after he hits somebody a lot. 137 DOOR TO CHIEF'S OFFICE - CHIEF'S OFFICE The cops open the door, pull Fletch inside. Chief Cummings, looking like a modern executive, looks up from his paperwork. COP #1 Here he is Chief. They roughly throw Fletch into a chair. The Chief -- seemingly oblivious to this brutality -- smiles sincerely. CUMMINGS Easy fellas. (To Fletch friendly) Be with you in just a second. The two Cops leave. As Chief Cummings continues with his paperwork Fletch looks around the office, which is decorated tastefully -- no guns on the wall, no American flags. On one wall there is a Matisse, and on another, various photos of the Chief with local celebrities. FLETCH You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you? CUMMINGS (laughs) You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve. (shakes his head and pushes his papers aside) So what's your name? FLETCH Fletch. CUMMINGS Full name. FLETCH Fletch F. Fletch CUMMINGS (skeptical but patient) I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch? FLETCH I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation. Cummings just stares at Fletch. CUMMINGS Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch? FLETCH Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probaly explains the curious feeling of love I have for you. CUMMINGS For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin.... FLETCH It was planted on me, sir. CUMMINGS We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want...Jane Doe? He suddenly kicks Fletch's chair out from under him. Fletch falls to the floor. CUMMINGS Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down. CUMMINGS I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men. FLETCH 'Your men' might just be involved in all this. CUMMINGS You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops. Cummings picks Fletch up, and holds him by the lapels. CUMMINGS If you keep nosing around, you make the bad guys just a little bit more cautious. That makes my job harder. And if you print your story this week, you might get some of my men killed. I can't let that happen, Mr. Fletch. He throws Fletch against the wall of celebrity photos, some of which fall to the floor. CUMMINGS You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it. FLETCH (picks up a picture) Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great. Fletch takes the picture and hurls it across the room. It smashes into the opposite wall and shatters. FLETCH I don't like Tommy Lasorda. 138 and OMITTED 139 140 JAIL CORRIDOR Fletch is tossed into an empty cell by the two Cops who brought him in. Cummings watches. The two Cops leave, and we see that all the cells in this corridor are empty. FLETCH You can't keep me here. CUMMINGS Maybe I'm not going to keep you here. (takes out a gun) Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out. FLETCH I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights. The Chief takes a knife out of his pocket, holding it with a handkerchief. CUMMINGS After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore...but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way. FLETCH My God, you're serious. CUMMINGS Ask anybody. FLETCH Can I ask anybody now? Cummings looks down the corridor. Deserted. FLETCH Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her. CUMMINGS (cocks the gun) What'll it be Fletch? Fletch looks in Cummings' eyes. They are steely and cold. He is quite serious. FLETCH I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you? CUMMINGS (opening the cell) Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column. Fletch walks out of the cell. Cummings walks with him through the empty corridor to the exit. CUMMINGS (very chummy) Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you? FLETCH Not a prayer. CUMMINGS That a boy. The emerge into the main hallway of the police station, which is filled with officers and civilians. Cummings makes a show of cordially shaking Fletch's hand as if they were old friends. CUMMINGS Thanks for coming down to see us. FLETCH Not at all, Chief. But next time...no tongue, okay? Exit Fletch. 141 thru OMITTED 147 148 INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE Fletch is railing at Frank Walker. FLETCH How could you call him? WALKER It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about. FLETCH It's also called getting me this close to being murdered. WALKER Get out of here. FLETCH He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story. WALKER You know, I've had it up to here with your bullsh*t. I need a story from you by tomorrow. FLETCH You'll have it. WALKER But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse sh*t paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs. FLETCH (exiting) Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank. WALKER (calling after him) I want something I can print! FLETCH (giving him the finger) Print this Frank. Exit Fletch. 149 thru OMITTED 152 153 EXT. RAQUET CLUB Fletch again appears in his tennis whites and walks familiarly toward the patio. Rich people are having lunch. Fletch stops the waiter. FLETCH Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk? WAITER In her cabana, sir. FLETCH Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six? WAITER Cabana one. FLETCH One. WAITER Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir? FLETCH I would, actually. WAITER Charged to the Underhills, sir? FLETCH Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar? WAITER Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion. FLETCH (whistles) I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor? WAITER I recommend it. FLETCH Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one. WAITER Very good, sir. The waiter leaves. Fletch looks around, takes a deep breath. FLETCH This is just the nicest place. 154 OMITTED and 155 156 EXT. CABANA ONE A little Spanish bungalow-type affair. Old California money-style elegance. Fletch rings the bell. MRS. STANWYK (V.O.) Who is it? FLETCH It's John. John... (forgets name) Znhcneelsky. MRS. STANWYK John Ultramalensky? She opens the door, clad only in a towel. A towel is wrapped around her head. She seems surprised, but not displeased, to see Fletch. She also seems a little at a loss for words. FLETCH Hi. MRS. STANWYK (finally) Hi. FLETCH I was hoping you'd say that. They have just shaken hands, and Fletch notices his hand is now sopping wet. MRS. STANWYK Uh...I'm just out of the shower. FLETCH Can I borrow your towel for a minute? She laughs a nervous little laugh. There is a bit of sexual tension here. MRS. STANWYK I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think...What do you want? FLETCH I ordered lunch. MRS. STANWYK You ordered it here? FLETCH Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be. MRS. STANWYK Down boy. With a nervous glance in both directions, she lets him in and closes the door behind them. 157 INT. CABANA They stand there for a few seconds looking at each other. MRS. STANWYK I really should change. FLETCH No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today. MRS. STANWYK I mean put clothes on. FLETCH Here, take mine. He starts to take off his shirt. She is amused, and responds playfully, but firmly. MRS. STANWYK Stop that! He does. MRS. STANWYK Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you? FLETCH Yes. She stands there, looking around, trying to act as if her heartbeat weren't speeding up. SFX: Knock at door. FLETCH Lunch.... MRS. STANWYK God.... She goes sprinting into the bathroom. FLETCH Come on in. The door opens. A second Waiter, Mexican, solemnly wheels in a cart bearing the goodies ordered by Fletch. The twin bottle of Dom Perignon juts from a silver ice bucket. WAITER You want I set up? FLETCH No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill. WAITER Muchas gracias. FLETCH Sierra del fuego. The waiter bows, leaves, shuts the door. Mrs. Stanwyk scampers back in, gazes at the cart as Fletch takes a bottle of Dom Perignon and pops the cork. MRS. STANWYK All this goes on Underhill's bill? FLETCH (offering her a glass) I saved his life during the war. MRS. STANWYK You were in the war? FLETCH No. He was. I got him out. She laughs and sighs, knowing she's getting into something she probaly shouldn't. MRS. STANWYK I can't believe I'm doing this. Well, lets eat. She tucks a napkin in her towel like a bib and sits at the table. 158 EXT. RAQUET CLUB - DAY The Underhills have just been handed the bill run up by Fletch. MR. UNDERHILL Four hundred bucks for lunch??? WAITER Your guest, sir. MR. UNDERHILL We have no guest here today. (reading the bill) Two bottles of Dom Perignon, hundred bucks a pop. Jesus H. Christ! Where is he? WAITER I believe he's with Mrs. Stanwyk. MRS. UNDERHILL Gail Stanwyk. Tom, if he's with Gail Stanwyk --- MR. UNDERHILL I don't care who he's with! This is criminal. MRS. UNDERHILL Tom.... MR. UNDERHILL She's where, cabana one? WAITER Yes sir. Mr Underhill stalks off. 159 INT. CABANA - DAY Fletch and Mrs. Stanwyk are having lunch. Fletch sings while he opens the champagne. She is looking at his back which is turned to her. FLETCH 'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes....' MRS. STANWYK It's amazing. FLETCH 'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching....' MRS. STANWYK Your bone structure, shoulders, neck.... FLETCH 'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.' MRS. STANWYK Just like Alan. It's freaky. FLETCH Can I ask you a question? MRS. STANWYK Depends on the question. FLETCH Are you still in love with Alan? MRS. STANWYK No. (quickly) I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else. FLETCH Why'd you let me in? MRS. STANWYK Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry. FLETCH Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan? MRS. STANWYK Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom. FLETCH Good point. MRS. STANWYK Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there. FLETCH What about his parents? MRS. STANWYK He never sees them and I never met them. FLETCH How come? SFX: Insistent knock at door. Fletch and Mrs. Stanwyk freeze. MRS. STANWYK Yes? MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here...I'm a new member. Fletch rises. FLETCH Thanks for the great time. MRS. STANWYK (sotto voice) What is this? FLETCH Long story. MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill. MRS. STANWYK (hissing) John! Fletch starts pushing the lunch table towards the bathroom. MRS. STANWYK You don't know the Underhills? MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you. MRS. STANWYK I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute? MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Of course. Mrs. Stanwyk follows Fletch into the bathroom. 160 INT BATHROOM Fletch jams the cart into the bathroom. FLETCH Take one end. Mrs. Stanwyk lifts one side of the cart. They lift it and put it up into the bathtub. There's a window in the bathroom. Fletch opens it. FLETCH I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk. MRS. STANWYK I think you should call me Gail, now. FLETCH Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him. MRS. STANWYK Why did you do it? Fletch shrugs, smiles. MRS. STANWYK A four hundred dollar lunch tab! FLETCH Yeah. MRS. STANWYK I'll cover it. You have any other surprises? FLETCH (after a beat) Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding. She stares at him. MRS. STANWYK Who. FLETCH Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe. A long beat. MRS. STANWYK So? FLETCH So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth. MRS. STANWYK What are you talking about? FLETCH That's what I want to know. 161 EXT. CABANA Mr. Underhill knocks again. MR. UNDERHILL Mrs. Stanwyk! 162 INT. BATHROOM MRS. STANWYK In a minute! FLETCH He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true. MRS. STANWYK How do you know about that? FLETCH He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad. MRS. STANWYK What does all this mean? FLETCH Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout? MRS. STANWYK Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --- FLETCH Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush. MRS. STANWYK But I've seen the deed. FLETCH You saw a forgery. He takes out his photographs. FLETCH That's the real deed. 162-A INSERT - PHOTO OF DEED It's is so fuzzy, shaky, and poorly framed that there's no way we can read the price on it. FLETCH (O.S.) Now, if this were at all legible, you'd believe me. 162-B MASTER Fletch shows her more of the photos. FLETCH Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented.... MRS. STANWYK Stop it. (angry and concerned) Are you saying my husband is defrauding me? FLETCH I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true. Mrs. Stanwyk stares at Fletch. She gets a little teary. FLETCH I'm really sorry I have to tell you all this. MR. UNDERHILL (O.S.) Mrs. Stanwyk? MRS. STANWYK (really screams) Just wait, all right?!? (to Fletch) I'm going to call my father. He'll know what --- Fletch stops her. FLETCH No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me. MRS. STANWYK Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know. FLETCH Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan? Gail is now teary, confused, and scared. MRS. STANWYK No...I've got to go to Mr. Underhill.... FLETCH I'll take you to a game. MRS. STANWYK What are you talking about? FLETCH I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game. MRS. STANWYK Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours? FLETCH (climbing out window) Act natural. MRS. STANWYK I was afraid you'd say that. FLETCH If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay? 163 EXT. CABANA Gail opens the door where Mr. Underhill has been waiting. MRS. STANWYK Sorry. Here. (grabs the bill from his hand) Thanks. Bye. She closes the door in his face. 164 OMITTED 165 EXT. BOYD AVIATION - PARKING LOT Alan Stanwyk crosses the parking lot and gets into his Jaguar. He starts the engine, backs out of his reserved space, and pulls out of the lot. 166 ANOTHER ANGLE - PARKING LOT Fletch is reading a copy of Sports Illustrated. He puts it down, starts his car, and pulls out of the lot. 167 SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD Stanwyk's Jaguar tools down Santa Monica Boulevard. Fletch's car follows, several discreet car lengths behind. 168 INT. JAGUAR Stanwyk checks his watch, and makes a turn. 169 MASTER Stanwyk has pulled into a service station. He gets out of his car and opens the trunk. 170 FLETCH He pulls into a fast-food joint on the west side of the street. He opens the Sports Illustrated and peers over it. 171 STANWYK He takes a gas can from the trunk, goes to the pump, fills it, and pays the attendant in cash. 172 FLETCH Curious. 173 STANWYK He puts the gas can back in the trunk, gets into the car, and starts off. 174 FLETCH follows suit. 175 SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD We are getting into the increasingly rundown section of Santa Monica. The Jaguar turns off. Hold: Several beats later, Fletch turns off. 176 OVERPASS A freeway overpass. Stanwyk stops his car. 177 FLETCH'S CAR He pulls off behind a liquor store, in view of the overpass. Fletch waits. 178 OVERPASS A second car pulls up behind Stanwyk's. A cop steps out and says something to Stanwyk. Stanwyk gets out of his car and walks over to the unmarked police car, and gets in. 178-A FLETCH takes out his binoculars. 178-B FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW Because he's looking through the reflection of sunlight on the back window of the unmarked police car, Fletch's point of view is fuzzy, but we can just make out the form of someone else in animated conversation with Stanwyk. 178-C FLETCH A moment of possible recognition. He focuses intently. 178-D FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - THE OTHER MAN IN THE CAR with Stanwyk...is Police Chief Cummings. 179 FLETCH FLETCH Jesus. He starts up his car and backs out. DISSOLVE TO 180 EXT. FLETCH'S APARTMENT HOUSE Fletch pulls up to his house and stops the car. 181 INT. CAR Fletch looks around. 182 EXT. HOUSE Fletch doesn't leave the car. 183 INT. CAR Fletch sits put, drumming his fingers on the steering wheel. He just has a feeling. He starts the car up, and pulls out. 184 EXT. HOUSE Two cop cars, concealed in driveways, scream out, heading after Fletch's car. 185 INT. FLETCH'S CAR Fletch sees them in the rearview and stomps on the gas. FLETCH Should've known. Goddamn it. 186 EXT. STREETS Fletch floors it. FLETCH Great. First I'll get a speeding ticket, then they'll shoot me. Terrific. Fletch cuts through the parking lot of a drug store/dry cleaning complex. The cop cars follow suit. Shopping wagons are tossed about. He turns a corner and realizes he has a few seconds before they're on top of him again. He screeches up next to a teenager in a sports car. FLETCH All right, fella, smog check. Move over. Before the guy can say "who?", Fletch is in the guy's driver seat and tears out, hell bent for leather. 187 ENTRANCE TO FREEWAY Fletch peels off onto the Santa Monica Freeway. 188 FREEWAY Fletch hits about ninety. So do the cops. Now a motorcycle cop joins the chase. 189 OMITTED 189-A INT. SPORTS CAR TEENAGER Holy sh*t! FLETCH Sorry, youngster, but we have to see what kind of fluorocarbons this thing puts out at ninety-five. TEENAGER Holy sh*t! FLETCH Don't worry about the speed limit. That's what the police escort's for. 190 EXT. FREEWAY Indeed, behind them is a gaggle of speeding cop cars and motorcycles. TEENAGER (O.S.) Holy sh*t! Fletch cuts across two lanes of traffic and gets off the freeway. He loses the motorcycle cop who goes past the exit. The squad cars are thrown behind a bit, but still chase. 191 INT. SQUAD CAR COP #1 Sh*t! He'll kill us if we lose him. 191-A INT. SPORTS CAR The teenager is sweating bullets. TEENAGER Okay, okay, just stop, will you. I admit it. I stole it. I was just taking it for a little joy ride, that's all.... FLETCH Holy sh*t. 191-B EXT. CAR Fletch squeals around a corner, runs a light, and booms into the parking lot of a large Holiday Inn. He's a few seconds ahead of the cops. FLETCH Okay, kid. Just stand here with your hands on the car and wait for the cops. I gotta pee. Here, take my hat. Fletch pops his hat on the kid's head, and runs off. 192 EXT. HOLIDAY INN Fletch runs into the kitchen entrance of the Holiday Inn. 193 INT. HOLIDAY INN KITCHEN Fletch picks up a case of vegetables and walks through as if he belonged there. Moments later, two cops enter. 194 THE COPS can't see him because of the crate. 195 INT. HOLIDAY INN - BANQUET ROOM A testimonial dinner is in progress. A sign on the wall reads: TRB SYSTEMS SALUTES FRED DORFMAN 40 YEARS OF SERVICE Thirty tables of conservatively dressed, older men and women are enjoying lunch. Fletch enters from the kitchen followed by several waiters and busboys. He looks over his shoulder. 196 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - KITCHEN Two cops are in hot pursuit. 197 FLETCH moves into the middle of the tables as a florid fat Speaker at the dais drones on. SPEAKER ...and he can truly be called the Father of Internal Bushings. A round of applause which Fletch joins heartily, as he quickly sits in the audience at an empty seat at a table in the center. FLETCH (to his table) Hello. I'm with the hotel catering. Are you enjoying your meal? Carrots overcooked? Fletch looks to the kitchen entrance and sees two cops scanning the crowd. One signals to the opposite door. 198 DOOR Four more cops converge, looking for Fletch. Distant sirens indicate even more. 199 MASTER SPEAKER And now a man who needs no further introduction.... The police spot Fletch and start moving forward. Fletch stands up. A spotlight swings onto him. FLETCH Thank you, Tony, thank you. As a lifelong friend of.... (looks at banner) ...Fred Dorfman, I'm thrilled to be here. 200 DIAS Fred Dorfman turns to the people on either side of him and whispers, obviously wondering who the hell this guy is. 201 FLETCH The cops are hesitant to move in. They wait for Fletch to finish and get out of the light. FLETCH Many of you are probably not aware of Freddie's lifelong commitment to honoring a profession that frequently goes unsung -- the police. Many times Fred used to forsake a night with his wife and children to go out an sell tickets for the Policemen's Benevolent Association. 202 POLICE look at each other, sensing a trick, and start to move in. 203 FLETCH going for broke. FLETCH Our men in blue are with us today, and I think we should all extend a shake of the hand, a slap on the back and a 'howdy' to them. 204 POLICE moving faster, but impeded by the crowd which rises and follows Fletch's suggestion. 205 FLETCH out of the crowd, still encouraging the crowd. FLETCH When was the last time you hugged a cop? Do it for my good friend Tommy Lasorda. Doesn't it feel good? Don't you wish you'd done it long ago? one cop raises his gun towards Fletch, but the crowd is too close, too busy. Fletch shakes his hand and slugs him so hard on the back that he falls over into the crowd. FLETCH Let them know how we feel, with a song. For every cop on every beat in every city of this great nation. (singing) 'For he's a jolly good fellow....' (calls out) Everybody! (sings) 'For he's a jolly good fellow....' The crowd sings along the rest of the verse. Fletch looks back to the kitchen entrance at the police who are swallowed in a sea of congratulations and singing. Fletch takes his time strolling out of the kitchen. 206 INT. LAX - DAY Fletch is at the Pan Am counter, talking with a reservation Clerk. CLERK Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class. FLETCH You're kidding. CLERK Would you like me to change anything? FLETCH (to himself) So he's going. Uh...are there any other tickets charged to the same account? CLERK We'd have no way of knowing that, sir. FLETCH Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and...is there anyone in the seat next to me? The clerk checks the computer. CLERK Yes, there is. Cavanaugh. Fletch shakes his head. He's never heard of him. FLETCH Never heard of him. Thanks anyway. CLERK You mean her. FLETCH What? CLERK Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here. FLETCH Oh, thanks. Fletch walks off and we follow him. CLERK She's from Utah. 207 EXT. PROVO AIRPORT - DAY as Fletch emerges from the Rent-A-Car office and drives off. 208 EXT. PROVO STREET - DAY A lower-middle-class area, one that seems to be sliding fast -- the plans are scraggly, the houses need paint. Fletch's rental pulls up over the curb onto the sidewalk. Fletch gets out, checks a piece of paper, and goes up the steps to a dark-shingled two-story house. 209 TOP OF STEPS Fletch looks at the name over the doorbell. 210 CARD written in smeared ink: "CAVANAUGH". 211 FLETCH rings the doorbell. It sounds like a fire alarm in the quiet. Nobody answers. Fletch tries the door. It opens. Fletch hums the old "Dragnet" theme. 212 INT. HOUSE still humming the theme. FLETCH 'Bom-ba-bom-bom...bommmm.' Fletch enters. 213 FLETCH's POINT OF VIEW - LIVING ROOM The shelves are bare. Furniture is in place. 214 MASTER Fletch enters the kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. Inside is a can of coffee, and some vegetables. Fletch leaves the kitchen and heads for the bedroom. We follow him as he enters the bedroom. 215 INT. BEDROOM Fletch opens the closet. It's bare. He pulls open the drawers. Nothing. Fletch gets down and looks under the bed. VOICE Who the hell are you? In his surprise, Fletch bangs his head as he starts up. 216 REVERSE At the door stands a gruff-looking Man in a red and black hunter's jacket, overalls, and a hat with earflaps. He holds a rifle. MAN Get up. 217 MASTER Fletch gets up. FLETCH The door was unlocked. MAN Lock's busted. FLETCH No wonder. MAN I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place. FLETCH I commend him on his choice. MAN What? FLETCH I commend him on his choice The Man stares at him, holding the gun. He's not the brightest guy in the world, and Fletch has already caught on to that. FLETCH I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh. MAN Who are you? FLETCH Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's. The Man just stares at Fletch. Fletch starts to move ever so slightly, testing his freedom of movement. FLETCH Where is she? MAN Moved out. FLETCH She moved out? The Man nods and cocks the weapon. Fletch stops his tentative movements and just looks around the room FLETCH I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything. MAN She moved out. FLETCH So you're saying she moved out. MAN This morning. FLETCH This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over. The Man continues to gaze unblinkingly at Fletch, holding the rifle. MAN What did you want under the bed? FLETCH Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon. MAN I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops. FLETCH I'm her cousin. MAN Tell the cops. FLETCH Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first. The man looks down at his shoelaces. Fletch kicks the gun out of his hand and runs through the house. 218 EXT. HOUSE Fletch runs out of the house and jumps into his car. 219 INT. CAR Fletch pulls out. The rear window is suddenly blown away. FLETCH I'm getting real tired of all this hostility. 220 EXT. PROVO PIG FARM Fletch pulls up, gets out of the car and addresses the couple sitting on the porch of the house. FLETCH Evening. (nods toward car) They oughta recall these things. One bump,the whole window goes. 221 PORCH Sitting on the porch is a couple in their late sixties, whom we are about to learn are Alan Stanwyk's parents -- Marvin and Velma. FLETCH (approaching the steps) Are you Mr. Marvin Stanwyk? Marvin nods FLETCH I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters. MARVIN (smiles) Harry S. Truman? FLETCH My parents were great fans of the former President. MARVIN Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two. FLETCH Sure did. Dropped the big one on them. MARVIN Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry? FLETCH Right. MARVIN Well, I'm fully covered. FLETCH I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub-insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son. MARVIN Yes. Where you from, Harry? FLETCH California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions? MARVIN Come on in. 222 INT. MARVIN AND VELMA'S LIVING ROOM Fletch and the Stanwyks face each other on couches that flank the fireplace. Fletch has a clipboard on which he will take notes. FLETCH First, a couple of routine things: are you and you wife currently alive? Marvin just stares at him. FLETCH Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named.... MARVIN Velma. Velma smiles. FLETCH Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation? MARVIN Check. FLETCH Okay. (makes notation) Now, the last time you saw your son was when? MARVIN Oh, about ten days ago. Fletch is taken aback. FLETCH Ten days ago? MARVIN That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so. This is all news to Fletch, but he covers his surprise. FLETCH Isn't that nice. Since when? MARVIN Since he moved to L.A. Fletch is very interested in all this. FLETCH Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo. MARVIN What the hell does this have to do with insurance? FLETCH Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy. MARVIN Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his. VELMA Cute young thing, too. FLETCH I'm sorry? VELMA His bride. Cute as a button. FLETCH You've met her? MARVIN Well, of course we have. He brings her with him. Fletch is getting very puzzled and very concerned about all this. FLETCH Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh? Marvin and Velma exchange the oddest of glances between them. FLETCH Has he? MARVIN Boy, what the hell's the matter with you? FLETCH Then he has. MARVIN Course he has. That's his wife. You could knock Fletch over with a straw. Again, he quickly recovers. FLETCH Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh? VELMA Cute thing. FLETCH (starting to sweat a little) Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife? VELMA Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some. Velma rummages through a family album on a side table as Fletch tried to sort all this out in his mind. She brings a photo over to him. He looks at it. 223 INSERT - PHOTO It's a wedding photo of Alan and a woman we have not seen. She is brunette and quite unlike Gail. Alan wears a similar sh*t-eating grin, and makes a similar thumbs-up gesture to the wedding photo with Gail that Fletch saw in Boyd's office. 224 FLETCH He sighs. FLETCH And they're still married...Alan and Sally Ann. MARVIN Of course they are. VELMA She's cute as a button. FLETCH How long have they been married? MARVIN Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A...four years April. FLETCH Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --- VELMA Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception? FLETCH (rising) No, thank you. VELMA How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party? Exit Fletch. 225 INT. PROVO MOTEL ROOM Fletch is on the phone. FLETCH Frank told you that? 226 INT. NEWSROOM - MORGUE Larry is on the phone. LARRY I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday. 227 MOTEL ROOM FLETCH You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank. 228 MORGUE LARRY I just thought...sure. (takes out pad and starts writing) Sally Ann Cavanaugh. 229 MOTEL ROOM FLETCH Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar. 230 INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - LATER Fletch is in the shower, lipsynching to the radio. Elvis is singing, "All Shook Up." FLETCH 'welluh bless my soul whatsuh wrong with me? I'ma itchin' like a man Inuh fuzzy tree....' The phone rings. Fletch gets out, throws on a towel and picks up a phone mounted over the crapper. FLETCH Yeah...No kidding. The Marriott at LAX. Sonofabitch...Checked in this morning. Great. Thanks a million. And call Gail Stanwyk at the Racquet Club. Tell her I have to meet her tonight. Eight o'clock at the club. Urgent and confidential. Thanks. 231 INT. PLANE - NIGHT Fletch is sitting in a semi-deserted flight on his way back home. He is hunched over an airline meal, eating with his right hand and turning in his mini recorder with his left. FLETCH Question: But as he pushed the button down, the tape pops out. He fumbles it back in, and then pushes another button. FLETCH Question.... TAPE RECORDER (Fletch's voice playing back) Day three on the beach. Fat Sam still hasn't moved, and --- FLETCH (stopping the machine) What's wrong with my life? He starts it right this time. FLETCH Question: Why does a man marry a millionaire's daughter in Beverly Hills if he is already married to a girl who lives in a crappy one bedroom apartment in Utah? Answer: Three million dollars. Big Question: What's with Stanwyk and Cummings? I don't know. Bigger Question: Why does Stanwyk want me to kill him? He takes a spoonful of airline food, chewing meditatively. FLETCH (continuing) Biggest Question: Why do I eat this sh*t? (to passing stewardess) Miss, I believe this has already been eaten. 232 EXT. MRS. STANWYK'S CABANA - NIGHT Fletch knocks on the door, and a tensely white-faced Mrs. Stanwyk quickly lets him in and shuts the door behind him. MRS. STANWYK I want you to know that dramatic phone calls about secret meetings scare the sh*t out of me. He can sense she is unusually upset. FLETCH What's wrong, Gail? MRS. STANWYK I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today. FLETCH No. MRS. STANWYK But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking. Fletch waits anxiously to hear if she told Alan about him. MRS. STANWYK So I told him...I told him I was just cold or something. Fletch sighs with relief. MRS. STANWYK I've never lied to him before. (chokes back a sob) It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.' FLETCH I think you better sit down. MRS. STANWYK Oh God, I hate things that start like that.... FLETCH Gail, please. She sits in a chair. he hands her the wedding photo. FLETCH I got this from Alan's parents. By the way, they see him all the time. First she looks at Fletch with puzzlement. Then, she looks at the photo and can't seem to decide what to think of it. But she knows it's bad. MRS. STANWYK What is this.... FLETCH I checked. There was no divorce. MRS. STANWYK Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist??? FLETCH I'm telling you he's not your husband at all. She is stunned. FLETCH And they're leaving the country tomorrow night. MRS. STANWYK (rocked) Bastard. FLETCH I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow. MRS. STANWYK I'm calling the police. Right now. FLETCH You cant do that. MRS. STANWYK Don't tell me I can't --- FLETCH They're trying to kill me! She is taken aback by that, but there is a determination in her eyes. MRS. STANWYK Your twenty-four hours are up, Fletch. She starts for the phone, but he stops her. FLETCH You're going to have to trust me, Gail. You have to. Now listen to me: he's expecting you to go to your meeting tomorrow night. Do it. Stay out of the house. There is a long beat. MRS. STANWYK I'm terrified. FLETCH Come here. He puts his arms around her and holds her tight against him. After a few seconds she raises her head and turns the hug into a kiss. Then the kiss turns passionate. DISSOLVE TO 233 FRISBEE sails across the surf. 234 EXT. BEACH - DAY - WIDER The usual scene-- a mix of teeny-boppers, junkies and surfers. Into the f.g. step a couple of "surfers." They're wearing wet suits and carrying surfboards, but they're obviously cops. They sit down. Across the beach, a Sufi, dressed in a turban and flowing garments, crosses the sand. SURFER COP A Sufi junkie. The cops laugh derisively and turn their attention else-where. 235 CLOSER ON SUFI It's Fletch. he's got a beard pasted on, and nervously scans the beach. 236 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - GUMMY is seated on a towel. 237 MASTER Fletch sits near, but not next to, Gummy. FLETCH Gum? Gummy looks around. FLETCH I'm the Sufi. GUMMY Fletch? FLETCH Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk. GUMMY What? FLETCH Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum. Gummy lies back down. GUMMY Why are they after you? FLETCH Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy. Gummy sits up. FLETCH Sit back down. Gummy lies down again. FLETCH Fat Sam is turning state's evidence. GUMMY What's that? FLETCH He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling. GUMMY I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam. FLETCH Sure you did. GUMMY Fletch, I never sold nothing. FLETCH Twenty years. Fletch gets up and adjusts his flowing robes. FLETCH Can't do a thing with this robe. One more question, Gum...don't look at me. Gummy lies back down. FLETCH Where does the Chief get the drugs? GUMMY I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget. FLETCH Rio de Janeiro, maybe? GUMMY Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil? FLETCH That's Brazil. GUMMY Yeah. Maybe. FLETCH Wait here for me, Gummy. Gummy looks questioningly at him. FLETCH It's the only way you'll be safe. Believe me. Fletch crosses the sand, heads for "Fat Sam's". 238 "FAT SAM'S" Sam is reading the National Review. He looks up, sees Fletch approaching, and grins. FAT SAM Jesus. FLETCH You don't know me. FAT SAM (smiling) My pleasure. FLETCH I'm serious, Sam. FAT SAM What, the heat here? FLETCH Affirmative. FAT SAM The two surfer boys? FLETCH Affirmative. FAT SAM Thought so. What for? FLETCH For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy game me a deposition. FAT SAM (smiles) You gonna nail the chief? FLETCH I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --- FAT SAM Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort. FLETCH You don't have a piece of the action? FAT SAM Noooo. Free snort. That's it. FLETCH (hands him a card) Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that. FAT SAM Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch? FLETCH What? FAT SAM You find the source? FLETCH Gum thought Brazil. FAT SAM Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive. 239 and OMITTED 240 241 INT. NEWSPAPER - CITY ROOM Fletch parades through the city room, still in his Sufi getup. He takes off the beard and heads for Frank Walker's office. Fat Sam and Gummy, looking like fish out of water, follow him. 242 WALKER'S OFFICE Fletch marches in with Sam and Gummy. Walker gawks at him. WALKER Fletch.... Fletch takes off the turban. FLETCH I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight. WALKER What? (stares at Fat Sam and Gummy) Who the hell are they? FLETCH This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. (hands two sheets of paper to Walker) WALKER What.... FLETCH Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship. Walker just stares at the sheets. WALKER Jesus H. Christ. (smiles) Fletch, this is the greatest. FAT SAM He's some reporter, this guy. FLETCH I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me. WALKER Fletch, I got nervous. Please.... FLETCH Forget it. Fletch takes off his robe and drops it to the floor. Beneath the robes he's wearing cutoffs and a Bob McAdoo t-shirt. FLETCH I'm going to write the story. Just hold the last couple of paragraphs till ten o'clock tonight. Fletch leaves the office. FLETCH (to Fat Sam and Gummy) Make yourselves comfortable, guys, but don't leave the office. 243 CORRIDOR Fletch heads for his office. Walker follows. WALKER Fletch! Fletch doesn't answer. 244 FLETCH'S OFFICE Fletch enters the office and kicks his door closed. Walker opens it. WALKER Fletch, you want an apology? FLETCH You were going to can me, right? WALKER (fumbles) Not really. FLETCH Not really? WALKER I was upset. FLETCH I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward. WALKER Fletch. Fletch sits down and turns on his word processor, ignoring Walker. 245 EXT. STANWYK HOUSE - NIGHT Fletch parks his Olds halfway up on the sidewalk, and gets out. He climbs over the gates of the Stanwyk home, and drops down inside. He lands on the grass, trots around the shrubbery, heads toward the garage, and checks his watch. 246 WATCH It's five minutes before eight. 247 INT. STANWYK'S GARAGE The jaguar is parked just where it is supposed to be, and the key is in the ignition. Fletch thinks for a moment and looks around. He sees a pile of torn rags on the ground. He removes the key from the ignition and opens the trunk. 248 INT. TRUNK. Six large gasoline cans and more rags. 249 FLETCH Another piece of the puzzle fits in place. 250 EXT. HOUSE Fletch reaches the rear of the house. He peers inside. 251 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - STANWYK is in the library, sitting patiently at his desk. 252 FLETCH approaches the French doors and enters. 253 and OMITTED 254 255 INT. LIBRARY Alan rises from his desk to greet him. His hair is combed like Fletch's. We can see that beneath his sports jacket he is wearing a Magic Johnson t-shirt and jeans. MR. STANWYK Good evening. FLETCH I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket? MR. STANWYK Of course. Stanwyk nods toward a small briefcase in the corner. Fletch eyes it quickly, and just as quickly looks back at Stanwyk who just stands there by his desk. MR. STANWYK Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent? FLETCH (smiles) Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe. MR. STANWYK What? Fletch holds out an envelope. FLETCH Read this, please. MR. STANWYK Wait a second --- FLETCH Cut the crap and read it. Stanwyk unfolds the paper. FLETCH (continuing) Unless my people hear differently, this letter goes out at midnight. 256 INSERT LETTER We see that it is addressed to: JOHN BOYD CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD BOYD AVIATION 257 STANWYK MR. STANYK (reading) 'Dear Sir: Alan Stanwyk murdered me tonight. The charred remains found by the police in the Jaguar are mine, not his. Mr. Stanwyk, using my name and passport, boarded Pan Am Flight 306 for Rio, where he intends to establish residence with ---' He stares at Fletch. 258 FLETCH He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases. FLETCH Pretty hefty. Keep reading. 259 STANWYK MR. STANWYK (reading) '...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.' Stanwyk stops. He's stunned, and not about to read anymore of this. GAIL'S VOICE (O.S.) Keep reading, Alan. Stanwyk spins to the doorway. 259-A GAIL STANWYK standing in the doorway. MRS. STANWYK Don't worry, I can take it. 260 MASTER FLETCH You shouldn't be here. MRS. STANWYK I want to hear this. Fletch takes the letter from Alan. FLETCH He doesn't read my stuff well. (reads) 'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.' (aside) That was stupid, Alan. MR. STANWYK I'd have been long gone. FLETCH Ahem. (continues reading) 'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.' Mr. Stanwyk blanches. Fletch continues. FLETCH 'By the way, Alan is a very big drug smuggler, but you can read all about that in tomorrow's paper. Sincerely yours, I.M. Fletcher. P.S. Have a nice day.' Alan mulls over all this for a few seconds, then smiles wistfully. MR. STANWYK Bravo, Mr. Fletcher. FLETCH The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together. Stanwyk shoots a surprised look at Gail. She returns it with an innocent shrug. MR. STANWYK (to Fletch) And what was that? FLETCH How similar in build you and I are. then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up. MRS. STANWYK My God, Alan, you really are and a**hole, aren't you? Now it is Alan's turn to shrug innocently. MR. STANWYK Sorry, darling. MRS. STANWYK You sonofabitch. MR. STANWYK Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm not a stupid sonofabitch. Mr. Stanwyk reaches into his desk and pulls out his gun, and levels it at Fletch. MR. STANWYK I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two? FLETCH Whoops. MRS. STANWYK (her bravado deflated) 'Whoops?' What do you mean 'whoops?' Don't say 'whoops.' MR. STANWYK I mean, by the time your story gets published, I'll be on the beach. I understand extradition from Rio is very complicated. I'll bet for two murders it's even more so. FLETCH That is a lighter, isn't it? Just then, the French doors swing open, and Chief Cummings enters. CUMMINGS Greetings, everyone. FLETCH (dryly) Thank God, the police. MR. STANWYK What the hell are you doing here? CUMMINGS Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them. Stanwyk lowers the gun. MRS. STANWYK (to Fletch) I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.' FLETCH Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay? MRS. STANWYK (to Cummings) I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now. CUMMINGS (laughs) Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was? During the following dialogues, Fletch starts nudging the fireplace's gas lighter jet key with his foot. CUMMINGS Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of. MR. STANWYK I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow. CUMMINGS What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you? FLETCH Whoa. Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk over, so we'll go catch the last ten minutes of Dynasty. Fletch and Gail actually start to leave, but Cummings draws his gun and fires over their heads. They dive for the floor, landing on the side of the fireplace. Fletch palms a Zippo lighter from his pocket. MR. STANWYK Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything. CUMMINGS Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my a** on the front page while you're basking in Rio. FLETCH ...with your money. Cummings turns his head momentarily to consider what Fletch has said, and Stanwyk takes advantage of the distraction to go for his gun. But he is too slow. Cummings shoots once, striking Stanwyk in the chest, killing him instantly. Gail screams in horror. Cummings turns to Fletch. CUMMINGS This one's going to be even more fun. FLETCH (striking the Zippo) Go ahead. Make my evening. Fletch hurls the lighter into the fireplace, causing a great whoosh of flames. Cummings throws his hands up in front of his face and Fletch leaps at him, wrestling him to the ground. Cummings is the stronger of the two, and just as he starts to gain dominance over Fletch, Gail Stanwyk staggers to her feet, picks up her husband's tennis racket in it's wooden brace, and slams it against Cummings' head with all her might. The Chief is knocked out. Fletch lies there, panting, trying to catch his breath. He looks up at Gail, still holding the racket, and staring at Alan's body. Fletch hustles her out of the room. 260-A HALLWAY FLETCH I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them. GAIL Where are you going? FLETCH Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around. (indicates the library) Don't go back in there. He starts to leave. She calls after him. GAIL (still holding the racket) I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I? FLETCH (smiles) You sure did. Fletch exits. DISSOLVE TO 261 EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY With Sugarloaf Mountain in the b.g., Fletch lies in a lounge chair, sipping an exotic drink, watching the cavorting lovelies and playing his battered Casio. This is obviously at some very expensive beach club or hotel, as witnessed by the uniformed servant who brings a telephone. WAITER (Brazilian accent) Your call is come through. FLETCH Far out. (to the phone) Larry? It's Fletch. (pause, looks around) Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but...any port in a storm. (pause) Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought. He pauses again to listen to Larry, but sees something O.S. that takes over his attention. he doesn't wait for Larry to finish what she's saying. FLETCH I gotta go, Lar. He hangs up and stands. We see that Gail has just walked up to him. The way they look at each other indicates they have not seen each other for awhile, and her arrival is a surprise to Fletch. GAIL John Ultramalensky, right? FLETCH Right. GAIL God, I haven't seen you since the wedding. FLETCH Gee, I must have been sh*t-faced at your wedding, I don't --- GAIL Not mine, stupid. Yours. FLETCH (big smile) What are you doing here? They start walking down the beach. We stay right with them. GAIL I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you. FLETCH No problem. He puts his arm around her, as we watch them leave us behind and walk off down the beach. FLETCH Basketball, of course, was invented in France, and is played with a large ball, two tongue depressors and a fish.... Fletch ad-libs just like Chevy Chase would as they walk further away down the beach until we.... FADE OUT THE END

    FADE IN:
1   EXT. SLATE QUARRY - DAY                                    1

    FRED FLINTSTONE, archetypical Everyman, sits atop his
    faithful heavy-equipment dinosaur, cranking the winch
    that makes the mighty beast rip and tear into the quarry
    wall.

2   THE QUARRY FOREMAN                                         2
    looks down at his wristwatch. Well... actually, it's a
    wrist sundial. And it's magic time... quittin' time...
    Millerock time!
    Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle
    bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of
    the workday --

               YABBA DABBA DO -- !
    Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the
    canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the
    tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and
    timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only
    motor (his feet), slows to allow a "time clock" dinosaur
    to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back
    up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and
    OVER --
                             MUSIC (V.O.)
               'Flintstones,

    -- And so forth, as for the first time in "his-tor-y" we
    see the Flintstones' OPENING CREDITS live!

    in the driveway of his three-bedroom ranch cave. A
    moment later, WILMA and PEBBLES run out -- both looking
    just like they should -- and get into the car. A beat
    behind them are the Flintstone pets, Dino and the
    saber-toothed cat.
    Fred pauses, looks around... HONKS his HORN... BARNEY,
    BETTY and BAM-BAM come out of the neighboring house, hop
    in!

    Fred's feet slap on the street as the car starts
    up --

    Fred and company pull in. He takes a giant sea shell
    "speaker" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his
    car door. He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma.
    (In the back seat, Dino pops his head up, tearing through
    the canvas top.) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and
    puts them on his head for a better view. CAMERA ZOOMS IN

    Dew drips from strange multi-leafed plants. Giant
    DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro. Bubbles rise from
    a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land.
    (The third one out carries a little suitcase.)

    CAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore. With a
    DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange,
    hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then
    WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven-
    foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus.
    It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a
    canvas sack, but we don't stress this.)

    Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs
    over the Xenosaurus.

    Dazed, the Xenosaurus gets up. As it does, we realize
    that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the
    shoulder of a gravel highway. A stone road sign reads
    BEDROCK 1/2 MILE. ROCK VEGAS, BABYLON & EDEN NEXT THREE
    EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and
    we see -- Bedrock!

     Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming
     protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early Spielberg light.

     The Xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills
     out. Then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight.

8    WITH THAT GARBAGE TRUCK                                    8

     It reaches the crest of a hill where there's a "WELCOME
     TO BEDROCK" billboard which bears greetings from the
     Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, and (of course)
     The Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes. The garbage truck
     guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and
     trot over the rise, coast down to the street below.
     The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and
     the rear guys hop off. One of them waves to --

     who returns the wave, then takes a four-pack of stone
     bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway.
     As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big
     TORTOISE with trash cans on its back. The Tortoise
     nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the
     curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The garbage men take the cans
     off the Tortoise's back, dump them into the truck.

     -- revealing   that the back of the truck is actually a
     giant-jawed   CREATURE strapped onto the chassis. The
     garbage men   dump the cans into its maw... it happily
     swallows the   works, licks its lips, BELCHES.
11   BACK TO SCENE                                              11

     The garbagemen slam the cans back on the Tortoise, who
     winces as they drive off.

                  You can forget about a tip for
                  Christmas...

     It waddles back up the lawn... passing by a wooden "lawn
     timer" box which now pops open.
     Inside the box is a "ROOSTERSAURUS" which CROWS and flaps
     its wings. The motion of the wings knocks loose two
     round stones which roll down two long troughs a la Rube
     Goldberg...

                                                          4.

12   FOLLOWING THE ROUND STONES                                12
     They reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging
     a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn
     spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. As
     it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its
     snout.

     Elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning MAMMOTHS repeat
     this performance. After a moment, they gradually slow
     their revolutions. The one closest to the house
     scrunches its trunk with a GROAN.

     WIDEN FROM the windowsill, where a little sea shell
     hearing aid trumpet AMPLIFIES another ROOSTERSAURUS
     "COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO" into the ear of a "CLOCK RADIO
     WOODPECKER." The Woodpecker yawns, gets out of bed,
     puts a timecard in a little clock. Then it turns
     and begins pecking on a BELL, which RINGS PIERCINGLY.

14   INT. BEDROOM - NEW ANGLE                                  14
     Two shapes are visible under the bedclothes: One is a
     great SNORING bulge, the other is a svelte and lithe
     shape. As the BELL continues RINGING, the larger bulge
     GRUNTS, MOANS, pulls a pillow over its head, and then
     finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. The slipper
     is thrown without aiming --
15   THE WOODPECKER                                            15
     ducks just in time.   It wipes its forehead nervously.

               even a health plan...

     He staggers back up to his perch, and then notices for
     the first time that the dial on the side is pointed not
     to "ALARM" but to "ALARM & RADIO." The WOODPECKER SIGHS,
     looks over at the bed where SNORING is still emanating.
     Then the bird swings a little telescope around to point
     out the window.

     Perched on top of the wooden radio tower are a monkey
     and an octopus. The monkey holds up cue cards which the
     octopus reads, and then waves nautical semaphore flags.

                  Good morning, Bedrock. This is

18   IN THE BED                                                    18

     The big bulge GRUNTS and MUTTERS a bit, then one hand
     gropes around, finds the curvaceous form under the
     neighboring covers... feels it tentatively... then
     the fingers "walk" upwards...
                                RADIO WOODPECKER (O.S.)
                  It will be fair and mild through
                  the weekend, continuing for the
                  next eight hundred years, followed
                  by cooling breezes and a protracted
                  ice age...
     Those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the
     covers... now they pull them down revealing the owner's
     face... the face of Fred, his eyes at half-mast, his
     face covered in fashionable "Bedrock Vice" stubble.
                                FRED

                  great big good morning kiss for
                  your Freddy-weddy?
     And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is
     immediately "YI-YI-YI-YI-ING," hopping all over the bed
     and showering Fred with sloppy kisses.

                  Ecological activist Ralph Naderock
                  warned that if new supplies of
                  kibble are not found, our animal-
                  powered civilization itself may be
                  threatened.

     By now Dino's affection   attack has knocked both master
     and pet to the floor in   a jumble of bedclothes, asses
     and elbows. Dino begins    to roll Fred across the room
     like a seal playing with   a ball.

                                FRED
                  Dino, that's enough -- here, look,
                  Daddy has a nice dino bone for
                  you, just please stop it --

     Fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a
     brightly-colored box labeled "PURINROCK DINO TREATS."
     Fred holds it up -- Dino gets up on two legs, eager for
     the treat -- Fred shakes the box... alas, nothing comes
     out.
     DINO "YI-YI'S" again, propelling Fred into the next room.

     Five-year-old PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and
     Dino tumble into the room like Frank Buck and a lion.
     Wilma turns at the noise. One look at her and we under-

     Saying this, Wilma puts   a huge egg at Fred's place.
     Meanwhile, Fred manages   to get to his feet, holds out
     one arm to keep Dino at   bay. Fred does a big "take,"

                  Pebbles, don't worry. These
                  stories are very exaggerated.
                  Like, you know, the boogyman?
                  There's no such thing as a huge,
                  inhuman reptile that attacks
                  without warning --
     WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window
     and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is
     happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously
     unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the
     slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill,
     looks out.

                  is here --

     "YI-YI-YI-YI!" DINO buys it again, runs to the door,
     lets himself out. This time Fred puts a chair against
     the door.

     Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER
     POPPING UP. We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were
     the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit
     who is tucked inside the toaster. As Wilma takes the

                  Thanks, Wilma...
     Fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then
     something outside the window catches his eye.

20   HIS POV - STREET                                              20
     A paperboy on a wood-and-stone bicycle is coming rapidly
     towards the house. In the bike's basket is a stack of
     dried, rock-hard clay tablets.

     Fred leans out the window, waving his hands.

                                FRED
                  Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at
                  the house -- please, not at the
                  house --
     WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams
     into the window frame, SMASHING a FLOWERPOT, taking out
     a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the
     kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this
     action in time to see --

     The rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the
     canvas roof of Fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent
     in the hood.

23   BACK TO SCENE                                                 23
     Fred sighs, turns back to his breakfast.

                                WILMA
                  Lucky it wasn't the Sunday paper.

                          (slight smile)
                  Yeah.   What else can go wrong?

     He slices through the big egg with his knife -- releasing
     a baby PTERODACTYL which SQUAWKS and flaps, knocking Fred
     over as it takes off through the window.

     In the neighboring driveway, Wilma and Betty pile the
     kids into Betty's car.

                                BETTY
                         (wiping their mouths)
                  Come on, kids. Time for nursery
                  school.

                         (as Wilma clears
                          her throat)
                  'Bye, big sweetheart.

     Fred kisses them both and they drive off. Fred sighs,
     tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to
     stitch. Nearby, Dino struggles to drag the stone news-
     paper inside the house. The twin headlines are, of
     course, KIBBLE CRISIS GROWS and MYSTERIOUS XENOSAURUS
     STRIKES AGAIN.

     Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge. As its
     mouth opens and closes, it appears to be talking, but
     the voice is that of --
                                BARNEY
                  Nice morning, huh, Fred?
                                FRED
                  What's nice about it?

                                BARNEY
                  Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a
                  real arm on him, don't he?

     Now we see that Barney is holding the flamingo's stiff
     legs which he scissors, making the bird's beak trim the
     hedge.

                                FRED
                  This is the third ragtop this year

                  donno, I'm just not a nine to
                  five guy. I got dreams, Fred.
                  Ideas --

                                FRED
                  Yeah, I know, I know, those
                  crazy inventions of yours. Be
                  honest with me, Barn... tell me
                  one thing you invented that
                  really caught on.
                                BARNEY
                  I invented fire.

                                FRED
                         (pause)
                  You invented fire?
                                BARNEY
                  I told you that, Fred. But the
                  coal conglomerate ripped me off.
                  The case is still in court, but
                  meanwhile I got lotsa other
                  ideas --
                                FRED
                  Yeah, but did any one of them
                  ever put bread on the table? How
                  long are you and Betty gonna live
                  on those penny-ante royalties you
                  get?

     Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges,
     examines it with dismay.

                                FRED
                  If you ask me, pal, you're just
                  blowing smoke up your own
                  volcano...

                                 BARNEY
                  Maybe, Fred.   But first...

     He uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood
     from Fred's surprised grasp.
                                BARNEY
                  Let me try some of that smoke on
                  your car.

25   INT. BARNEY'S GARAGE/WORKSHOP - DAY                         25
     We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway.
     (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a
     bit more, then collapses from exhaustion).
     Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and
     ends, plus various inventions and scale models in
     different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a
     number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work).
     Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green
     material.

     Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood
     into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.
                               BARNEY
                        (as he works)
                 -- See, the first step, we make
                 a mold of the old car hood, smooth
                 out the dent in the clay --
     He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash.
     Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of
     ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood.

                               BARNEY
                 -- Add some lava granules... some
                 woca leaves... juice from two
                 coo-coo berries...

                               FRED
                        (impressed)
                 Two coo-coo berries?   You made of
                 money, Barney?

                               BARNEY
                 Anything for a pal, Fred -- a
                 lump of coal... bamboo sawdust...
                 eucalyptus sap... a touch of the
                 La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila.
     Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it;
     satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock
     weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out
     of his skin.

26   NEW ANGLE                                                   26

     Fred is caked with dust.   He coughs and spits.
                               FRED
                 Barney, why don't you try inventing
                 a brain for yourself! Look at what
                 you did to --

     proudly lifts out a perfect (though greenish) duplicate
     of the car hood. As Fred examines it, impressed despite
     himself, we...

     The two kids are in the back seat. Somehow both of the
     kids' faces are messy again. Working together with
     beautiful precision, they are carefully dismantling the
     rear armrests and door handles.

                  Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but...
                  well, he's just not cut out to punch
                  a clock. And he's such a dreamer,
                  you think he ever once picked up a
                  hammer and chisel and tried to
                  balance a checkbook?
     They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little
     nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees
     them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un-
     load the kids.
                                BETTY
                  No, Barney just keeps looking for
                  that coo-coo berry pie in the sky,
                  and I don't want to pop his balloon
                  by talking about the price of
                  mastodon ribs.

     She wipes off Bam-Bam's mouth with a handkerchief. Wilma
     does the same with Pebbles and then they kiss the kids,
     who immediately run into the schoolyard.

                  You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But
                  we wipe their mouths every day.

                  No, no, I mean for all your wonderful
                  support the past few years. It's
                  parents like you that make me think
                  twice about retiring.

                  to grow up and put your nose to the
                  grindstone, batten down the hatches
                  and join the ratasaurus race with
                  the rest of us.
                         (meaningfully)
                  It's time to retire those dreams.
     Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything.    Suddenly Fred
     pulls over, stops the car.
                                 FRED
                  Barney.   Look.

     They're at the crest of a high wide hill.

                                 BARNEY
                  Hey.   Lava Lane.
                                FRED
                  Remember the old days, Barn? We
                  used to race our go-carts here to
                  impress the girls.

                                BARNEY
                         (wistful)
                  Yeah, those were the days... we
                  usta dream about coming back here
                  some day with a real car and goin'
                  for the goldrock...!

     A look from one to another, and then down the hill...
     Fred gets a malicious grin on his face.

                  Fred... I thought you said it was
                  time to retire those old dreams.
                               FRED
                  Hey. Since when do I have to be
                  consistent?

     The two pals laugh, and then    with a whoop they begin
     pedalling like mad. They go     over the top, gravity takes
     over and they are flying past    that billboard with all the
     Rotary Club welcomes on it.     But now we see a different
     sort of welcome, as a POLICE    CAR ZOOMS out from behind it.
30   POLICE CAR - CLOSER                                            30

     Inside are SERGEANT FELDSPAR and his rookie partner,
     OFFICER GRAVEL. Cackling with anticipation, Feldspar
     opens a box marked radar detector. Out pops a little
     bird in a police helmet. It has a stopwatch (actually,
     stop-sundial) around its neck. Feldspar points -- the
     bird salutes -- takes off!
31   FRED AND BARNEY                                                31

                        (spotting the cops)
                  Oh-oh! Fred, slow down -- !

     Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the RADAR BIRD flying
     alongside them. It checks its stopwatch, writes a note
     to itself. Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice
     as --

32   THE POLICE CAR                                                 32
     cuts in front of Fred. Fred SLAMS on the "BRAKES," sits
     helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning.
                                FELDSPAR
                  Well, Flintstone, looks like today's
                  the day.
                                FRED
                  Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't
                  speeding... honest...

     Fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks...
33   ANGLE ON FLOORBOARD                                            33

                                FELDSPAR (O.S.)
                  Forget it, Flintstone. This time
                  I got you dead to rights --
     Fred opens the box. A scary-looking winged reptile
     sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips.

34   BACK TO SCENE                                                    34
     Confident, Feldspar jerks a thumb at the Radar Bird,
     turns to his rookie partner.

                                FELDSPAR
                  Gravel. Get me the radar reading
                  and I'll show you how we deal with
                  scofflaws.

     Gravel nods, steps towards the bird. The bird checks
     its stopwatch... and then it notices the flying lizard
     which is hovering nearby, licking its lips.
                                 RADAR BIRD
                  Whoa!   Wings, do your stuff -- !

     The Radar Bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour,
     leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind.
     Feldspar catches the watch, startled.
                                FRED
                  Well, Sergeant, if you don't have
                  a radar reading, I guess we'll --
                         (quickly)
                  -- justbeonourway -- !

     A new cloud of dust appears as Fred ROARS away.
                                 FELDSPAR
                  Flintstone!   Flintstone, come back
                  here -- !

     Betty and Wilma   have just pulled up. We notice that next
     to their legal   spot, a big limousine is parked in a "no
     parking" zone.    But our law-abiding Betty in the next
     space now drops   a stone coin in a parking meter.

     coin to check it, then turns over an egg timer.

     It's absolutely   mobbed. Customers push past each other
     with armloads of   food. Gigantic cuts of meat hang from
     above or are on   display behind the counter. MORRIS THE
     BUTCHER looks up   from the chaos and manages a weak smile
     for the girls.

     overdressed.

                  Of course, Mrs. Slate.   Just take
                  a number.
     Wilma senses the tension, quickly steps forward to break
     it with a smile.
                                WILMA
                  Ah, hello, Mrs. Slate.

     Morris reacts with relief.    Mrs. Slate reacts with a
     blank look.

                                WILMA

     She turns her back to Wilma, forces her way towards the
     counter again. Wilma burns.

                                 MORRIS
                  Gino?   We got any dodo bird?

     GINO turns, looks at his end of the counter.
                                GINO
                  There's one left -- and it's the

                  Give it to Mrs. Rubble along with
                  this.

     Gino nods, smiling. He picks up a crate, begins to load
     it with giant fryer parts and several manhole-sized meat
     patties.

     Mrs. Slate steps to the counter. Meanwhile, the staff
     begin using a refrigerator dolly to bring out giant ribs,
     steaks and sausages which they pile up in front of Wilma.

                  the shelf. I mean fresh.

                  I don't care if you're busy. What
                  I care about is my adorable little
                  grand nephew. He's staying with
                  me for the summer and I intend to
                  make his favorite dish... Southern
                  fried chickensaurus! Now I want

     with a sigh, they buckle on elbow and knee protectors,
     go to a side door, open it. Inside is another barred
     door. They open it, go inside. Immediately we hear
     loud SQUAWKING and CACKLING... THUDS, BUMPS...

     Suddenly the barred door slams open and a      giant chicken-
     saurus comes bounding out, with Morris's      staff hanging
     all over it like rodeo cowboys. They try       and restrain
     it with ropes but it's enraged and flops      around the

     The huge bird lands with a crunch atop Mrs. Slate's car,

     gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various

     beaming in the respect he gets here.

     He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on,
     knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (F.

                  Here, you're getting in on the
                  ground floor of the first footstep
                  of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's
                  the old backhand? And with a guy
                  like me ta show you the ropes, you
                  can skip all the red tape, all the
                  malarky, all the dino doo --

                                                              22.

     Fred stands near the weight station booth, where a plump
     GIRL in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer.

                               GIRL
                        (New York accent)
                 Hi, Mr. Flintstone.

                               FRED
                 Hiya, Shirley. This is my very
                 special neighbor and pal Barney
                 Rubble. He needs an application
                 form, okay?
                               GIRL
                 Anything for you, Mr. Flintstone.

     She slams down two clay tablets and a stylus.
                               GIRL
                 Here you go.
                        (smiling)
                 Thanks again for the football tickets.
                 My boyfriend and I both liked them.

                               FRED
                 My pleasure, Shirl.    Anytime.
                               GIRL
                 Okay. But do you think next time
                 we could go to the same game?
                               FRED
                        (confidently)
                 No problem.
     Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps
     towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips,
     master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.
                               FRED
                 Well, Barn, what did I tell you?
                 When you're in with Flintstone,
                 you're in like Flint.
                              BARNEY
                 Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big
                 shot. I just didn't know how big.
     Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to
     the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it
     and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's
     sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the
     CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the
     Slate Construction Office.

                                                    CUT TO:

46   INT. OFFICE - PULLBACK FROM WINDOW                        46
     The room here is dominated by a tabletop architectural
     model of a large scale construction project. There's
     acres of little development houses, then some tall office
     buildings, a mall, you name it: There's even little foot-
     powered model cars in the model parking spaces.

     Near this we see MR. SLATE, a giant in the Bedrock con-
     struction business (but not in height). Slate drinks
     coffee from a "Boss" mug, listens with growing impatience
     to JERRY LAVA. Several of Slate's lackeys listen, their
     heads nodding up or down in sympathy with Slate's mer-
     curial moods.
                             LAVA
               Uncle, if you'll look at this unit
               cost projection... it intersects
               here with --
                             SLATE
               -- how'd you like my fist to
               intersect with your nose? I've
               told you a hundred times, don't call
               me uncle in the office! Now, I didn't
               arrange your scholarship to Harvrock
               University so you could waste my time!
               So stop beating around the bushasaurus
               and get to the bottom slime!
                             LAVA
               You'll be bankrupt in six months.
     Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model.
47   EXT. QUARRY - MOVING SHOT                                 47
     Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers
     and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving.
     Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them,
     we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the
     quarry's sides.

                             BARNEY
                      (to himself)
               Social Security number...
               dependents... 'how learned of job'
               ... newspaper ad, carrier pigeon...
                      (writing)
               ... Personal reference...
     Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees --

48   FRED'S POV - A WRECKING BALL OPERATOR                     48
     A burly and rough looking guy named PILTDOWN, he grins in-
     side his dino-topping cupola, winds his winch handles and
     then propels his wrecking ball towards the...

                                                            24.

49   QUARRY WALL - ABOVE                                          49
     -- where the huge stone BALL SMASHES into some walnuts
     balanced on a boulder.

50   WIDER                                                        50
     Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps  up the
     walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one   in place.
     (It should be noted here that the relationship  and physi-
     cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors  that of
     our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and  Barney.)

                             PYRITE
               Way ta go, Pilty baby. Five bucks
               says you can't hit one on the fly.

                             PILTDOWN
                      (calling up)
               Yer on, Pyrite --
     Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge.    The
     wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall.
51   BELOW                                                        51

     Workers near Fred duck as dust and debris fall down.
     People grab for their construction helmets.
                              FRED
               Not again...
     Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to
     the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow.
                             FRED
               All right, Piltdown, that's enough!
               You're endangering your fellow
               workers!

                              PILTDOWN
               Yeah?   Sez who?

                             FRED
               Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop
               steward of Amalgamated Neolithic
               Workers 101.

                             PILTDOWN
               Yeah? Well, A.N.W. one-oh-one gives
               us workers a snack break. So...
                      (a nasty grin)
               ... I'm breakin' some snacks.

     He swings the wrecking ball again.

                                                          25.

52   UP ABOVE                                                    52
     This time he's overdone it:   The wrecking ball flies past
     the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks  for cover -- and then the
     wrecking ball whips over and  around the handrail which
     runs along here, twisting as  tightly as Indiana Jones'
     whip. The handrail wobbles   dangerously in its
     foundation --

53   PILTDOWN'S DINO                                             53
     SNORTS, backs up -- the crane SUPPORTS on its back begin
     to CREAK and GROAN with the strain --

54   WIDER                                                       54
     Workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse.   Fred
     runs to grab the dino's reins.

                              FRED
                Whoa, whoa, big fella --
     He calms the beast by giving it a carrot.   As it munches,
     Fred quickly ties the reins to a post.
                              FRED
                       (calling up to the cab)
                You're on report, Piltdown! If it's
                up to me you'll be pushing a
                wheelbarrow!

                              PILTDOWN
                       (leaping down)
                You've been asking for this,
                Flintstone... I'm gonna kick your
                fat butt --
                              FRED
                Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney --
                       (sotto, very sincere)
                -- Barney, hold me back --
     Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred.
     Barney looks up and sees --
55   THE CRANE ON THE DINO'S BACK                                55

     It is shuddering and threatening to come crashing down.

56   BACK TO SCENE                                               56
                              BARNEY
                Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix
                that first.
                              PILTDOWN
                Why should we?
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                BARNEY
                  It looks dangerous. Besides, you
                  can kick Fred's fat butt anytime.
                                FRED
                  Yeah.  That's right.
                         (realizing, a glare
                          at Barney)
                  I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown.
                         (turning, shouting)
                  Come on, guys. Let's clean up the
                  mess.
     With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are
     gathered and the crew hops to it...

57   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME                             57
     Slate stands in a blubbering fury as Lava mops coffee up
     from the model and Slate's face.
                                 SLATE
                  Bankrupt?   Are you crazy?

     Lava holds up a clay tablet covered with figures.
                                LAVA
                  It's all here in hack and slice.
                  When you committed to this housing
                  development the price of dino kibble
                  was a few clams per ton. Since then,
                  it's gone up a hundredfold.
                         (indicating the model)
                  You can't build a project like this
                  without the heavy equipment dinos,
                  and we can't afford to feed those
                  dinos.

     Slate glowers, paces around the model.
                                SLATE
                  I'm two months behind schedule, my
                  option's running out on the land
                  and Donald Trumprock is just waiting
                  to jump in and steal the whole deal
                  ... meanwhile that damn union's on
                  my back, hell, they'll probably want
                  an eighty hour week or something...
                         (frustrated)
                  There's got to be an answer...

     A LOUD COMMOTION outside the window attracts everyone's
     attention.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                 SLATE
                  What's that?

                         (worried)
                  Sounds like a worker's comp claim
                  if I ever heard one...

     All rush to the window.       They look out and see --
58   THE QUARRY - WIDE                                               58

     Supervised by   Fred, all    the workers are straining on the
     ropes to haul   the rear    legs of the crane back into their
     sockets on the   back of    the big dino. Only the last
     critical rope   is still    dangling.

                                 FRED
                  Barney!   Grab that line!   Hurry!
     Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's
     face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it...
     Fred throws his own weight into the effort...

59   THE CRANE                                                       59
     THUDS into place on the dino's back -- the workers cheer --
60   THE WRECKING BALL                                               60
     alas, with its cable now twisted shorter, it's become an
     immovable object, and as the shortened CABLE SNAPS, the
     wrecking ball begins to roll down the quarry wall.

     Men and ANIMALS YELP and dive out of the way as the BALL
     rolls downwards, SMASHING everything in its path.
62   EXT. SLATE'S OFFICE WINDOW                                      62

     The executives watch concerned as --
63   THE WRECKING BALL                                               63

     tumbles down, down, knocking scaffolding and ladders
     aside, reaches the end of a ramp, and drops through the
     air right onto --
64   THE HOOD OF FRED'S CAR                                          64

     -- where, astonishingly, the HOOD sinks in resiliently
     like a trampoline and then with a loud "SPROING" the
     wrecking ball flies straight back up into the air,
     followed a beat behind by the unhinged hood itself.
     Both hurtle TOWARDS the CAMERA --

                                                             28.

65   SLATE AND EXECUTIVES                                          65
     react fearfully as they realize all this is coming
     straight for them. With a howl, they all dive aside --

66   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - WIDER - DAY                             66
     The wrecking BALL flies through the window, SLAMS onto
     Slate's desk, crushing everything in its path and then
     sails on SMASHING right into --
67   THE MODEL DEVELOPMENT                                         67

     -- where all of the lined up HIGH RISES SMASH ASIDE with
     a sound like falling pins.

     The workers pick themselves up and now their eyes follow
     the path taken by the long-gone wrecking ball.
                               FRED
               Oh boy.    Goodbye pension fund --
     They rush for the office building.

69   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                     69
     Dust is still settling. The staff rises from the mess,

               I'm over here, you moron -- and
               don't call me 'Uncle'!

     Slate's eyes fall on Fred's car hood, swinging from a
     bookshelf. He reaches for it -- pulls it -- it stays
     put, and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster
     which reburies him. At the same time, the door slams
     open and Fred, Barney and the other workers tumble inside.

     the last remaining little HIGH RISE FALLS.

     Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. He
     finally yanks the car hood free. It bounces and VIBRATES
     in his hands like a hand saw.

     parchments.
                                BETTY
                  I know Bam-Bam --
                         (correcting herself)
                  -- pardonez-moi, 'Bem-Bem' will love
                  attending your school and performing
                  in the talent show. Thank you oh
                  so much.

     She gives Mrs. Slate an even and controlled look, and
     sends some of it over in Wilma's direction as well.
     Wilma makes her choice, smiles tightly.

                                WILMA
                  Let me have one of those, too.   For
                  ma petite Pebbles.

74   INT. CAR - FRED AND BARNEY - NIGHT                             74
     They're cruising along. Fred puffs on a cigar. Barney
     flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap. In the
     back seat are some boxes and bundles.
                                BARNEY
                  Gee, Fred, I don't believe it.
                  Eight hours ago I didn't have a
                  job and now look -- I got 1/2 of
                  one percent of the after-taxes
                  after-expenses net breakage profits
                  on Fibrerock!
                                FRED
                  Just be thankful I was there to go
                  over the fine print.
                         (full of himself)
                  It's like I told you this morning
                  -- There's something noble about a
                  man digging in with his hands and
                  doing an honest day's work. Once
                  you file those dreams under 'old
                  business' and put your nose to the
                  plow, well, the world is your
                  oyster. And was I right?
                                BARNEY
                  No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't
                  nose any grindstones and you didn't
                  shoulder a wheel. We just hung out
                  together and everything that
                  happened was a total accident.

                                FRED
                         (after a moment)
                  Details, Barney, details...
                         (smiling)
                  I just can't wait to see the girls'
                  faces when we tell 'em the news...
75   INT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT                                  75

     The girls' frowns are a great contrast to their husbands'
     smiles. Wilma's looking at the school enrollment forms.
     Betty paces, looks at the clock.

                  It's not like the boys to be so
                  late.
                                BETTY
                  Unless they were forced to go
                  bowling again. Remember that time
                  a burglar pointed a gun at them
                  and said, 'go bowling right now'?

                                WILMA
                  Betty, sometimes you're a little
                  too gullible --

                  No kidding.
                         (indicating the forms)
                  Do you have any idea of what the
                  enrollment fee is? And get this...
                  it's non-refundable --
                                BETTY
                  I know, I know! I just couldn't
                  stand that woman's attitude! But
                  we had to find a new school anyway,
                  and there we were... the next thing
                  I knew, I was in over my head...
                  but why did you jump in, too?

                                WILMA
                  Oh, she was getting to me too with
                  all that mastodon snort about her
                  little nephew... and...
                               BETTY

                                WILMA
                  And... if a friend can't help you
                  do something stupid, who can?

     Betty smiles, touched.    Then reality intrudes again.
                                BETTY
                  What do we tell the boys?

     Suddenly the door bursts open.     Fred and Barney run in
     with candy and flowers.

                                FRED AND BARNEY
                  Surprise!

                                FRED
                  Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly
                  realized that we had a little spare
                  change.

                  sticking beside me during the
                  tough times, and well... for
                  making a little guy feel like he
                  was ten feet tall.

                                BETTY
                  Aw, Barney... I... I don't deserve

                  Hey. Fred does something stupid
                  every day and I still love him.

     Fred laughs good naturedly, grabs Barney in a headlock.

     She closes her eyes, swings the enrollment forms over on
     the table so that Fred and Barney can read them.
     Fred and Barney look at them, look at each other... and
     yawn.

     A sign proclaims this as "GRAND BEDROCK LODGE -- LOYAL
     ORDER OF WATER BUFFALO." The parking lot outside is full
     of vehicles. We hear the sound of a GAVEL BANGING...

78   INT. WATER BUFFALO LODGE - NIGHT                              78

     The members are milling about the main room, schmoozing,
     drinking, kibitzing. All wear the furry and horned
     ceremonial Fez of the Buffalo.

     One wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge
     coat of arms (with the motto "Ackus Ackus Adackus" below);
     a trophy case holds a mind boggling display of various
     bowling trophies, balls and pins. At the lectern, the
     HERDMASTER (a mustachioed, inspirational type) bangs
     again for order.
                                HERDMASTER
                  Brothers, your attention!

     It quiets a bit. He clears his throat, raises his chin,
     and gives a strange mournful bellow.

                  The herd is now called to the

                  Buffaloes is now in session.

                  old business?
     Barney stands, acknowledges his friends and Lodge
     brothers.

                  Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster.
                  Tonight we are to hear speeches
                  from prospective candidates for
                  Lodge offices, such as good old
                  Fred and some other guys.

     Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies, he
     immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives
     an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster's earlier
     call to order.

     After the CRY ECHOES away:

                  Brother Piltdown: You have given
                  the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at
                  the Poisoned Water Hole. Do you
                  wish to file an objection?

                  You bet I do. How come Flintstone
                  is 'good old Fred' and me and the
                  other candidates are just 'some
                  other guys'?

                  My apologies, Brother Piltdown.
                  Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we
                  will hear speeches from a whole
                  bunch of good old guys...
                         (pause)
                  ... plus the one and only Fred
                  Flintstone!
     Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of
     the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium
     as the noise dies down.

     Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up
     tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it
     to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big
     "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster.
     Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does,
     Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his
     pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches
     up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it,
     continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands
     Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each
     other like a Pharaoh's badges of office.

     Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down,
     and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.

                  Apprentice Antlers, a great good
                  evening to you all. Ahem. As you
                  know, our organization has survived
                  difficult times that have seen the
                  extinction of such other lodges as
                  the Order of Whooping Cranes and
                  Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But
                  we here have come through the croo

                  Herdmaster, I would bring to you
                  the same determination, courage
                  and -- if I may say so -- bold
                  thinking that I have brought to
                  the workplace. Thank you, and

     Applause follows Fred's return to the floor.

     The only ones in their row not clapping, they scowl as
     Fred passes them...

     WIDEN as Barney propels   a bowling ball (stone, of course)
     rumbling down the alley,   sending pins flying. The
     Buffaloes cheer Barney's   strike. We notice that most (if
     not all) of these Lodge   members also work at the quarry.

84   AUTOMATIC PIN SPOTTER                                        84
     It descends.    It consists of a bent snout creature which
     "cranks" down   a shelf with several monkeys on it. The
     monkeys grab   the pins with their tails, straighten them
     up. Then the    shelf cranks back up.
85   OTHER END OF ALLEY                                           85

     Now it's Fred's turn. He trots up to the line, bowls...
     another strike! More cheers, AD LIB complaints, etc.
     The scorekeeper picks up hammer and chisel and fills out
     the last frame.
                                LODGE MEMBER
                  Congratulations, Fred.

     Fred leads the group over to the bar. Piltdown and
     Pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew?
     Fred reaches --

     where he pulls out a hook-beaked little LIZARD --

     The critter bounces into the shelf, slides... when it re-
     covers, it realizes that its overbite has been straightened
     out by the impact. Very happy, it grabs a hat and coat,
     exits.

     It's actually "dots" chipped into a stone. It shows the
     young Fred, Barney and others gathered around soapbox
     racers. A banner reads "Junior Buffalo Day."

               Fred, what was all that stuff in
               your speech about the workplace?
               I thought the only decision you
               made there was how many lunches to
               eat --
     Laughter. Fred accepts it good-naturedly, reaches into
     his pocket.

               Well, Harry, it just so happens

               world... Boys, you're looking at
               Mr. Slate's new partner.

               You and Slate? Who are you
               kidding, Flintstone? The only
               partner you got is hanging over
               your belt.
     Pyrite laughs, a bit too much.

               Yes, boys, you see, I went up to
               my pal, Mister Slate and single-
               handedly made him an offer he

     Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor. They stand near
     a trophy case. There's some bowling trophies here with
     a variety of names on them. (There's also trophies for
     "pie-eating contests" and "beer drinking chug-offs";
     these have only Fred's name on them.)

                               BARNEY
                 Fred... what's this single-handed
                 stuff? I distinctly remember at
                 least four hands and two of them
                 were mine.

                               FRED
                        (lowered voice)
                 Barney, we could tell everyone how
                 you invented this Fibrerock stuff,
                 how Slate and Lava found out about
                 it by accident and all, but what
                 would that be?
                              BARNEY
                 The truth?
                               FRED
                 This is big business, Barney. We
                 can't start telling the truth,
                 it'd create the wrong impression.
                 Think about all the really big
                 deals in history -- back to the
                 beginning of recorded time.
     Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.
                              BARNEY
                 Okay.
                                FRED
                 What do they all have in common?
                        (as Barney is
                          stumped)
                 I'll tell you. A front man. A
                 guy who's out in the public eye
                 running the point, fighting the
                 crowds... and meanwhile... back
                 in the corner is the silent
                 partner.

                               BARNEY
                 I never knew that.

                               FRED
                 That's because the silent partner
                 is always silent.

     He stops, turns. Betty comes over and we see he's wear-
     ing a sports jacket and an abysmally-tied tie. Betty
     fixes the knot.
                                BETTY
                  There. That looks more like a
                  captain of industry.

                  Thanks, Betty. What would I do
                  without you?

                                BETTY
                  Hmm. Probably run off to the
                  tropics with one of those
                  executive secretaries.

                  Fred! Wait a minute! There's

     He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find
     it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly
     presents him with a spanking new briefcase. "F.F" is
     embossed on it in gold.

     He opens it.    Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs.

                Piltdown, this Fibrerock program
                is going to create a lot of
                changes around the plant. I want
                to make one more. You've been a
                wonderful thug and goon for me.
                Now, I'd like to expand your
                duties. I want you to become a
                provocateur.

                Gee, Mister Lava, I donno.   I
                kinda like girls myself.

                lives a living hell.

106   MONTAGE - ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY                                  106

      Now, accompanied by heroic "industrial"-type MUSIC, we
      see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation.

      This cannot be described    now with appropriate justice,
      but it involves a series    of animal-powered conveyor
      belts, Rube Goldberg-like    funnels, spouts and chutes,
      and all sorts of gadgets,    gizmos, bells and whistles,
      to wit:
                                                    (CONTINUED)

106   CONTINUED:                                                    106
      At one end of the building, dino-powered dumpsters and
      lifters drop off all the ingredients; these get stomped/
      chewed/bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is
      then (courtesy of some squirting Mastodans) mixed with
      water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill-
      type trough and is held back by a gate.

      Meanwhile, we see a sample item (in this case, a stone
      sofa) as it is placed before two "goatasauruses" which
      butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of
      a clay mold. When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed
      aside, Barney appears and personally "aims" the foam
      trough at a funnel in the top of the mold. Pausing to
      "taste" the mix, he smiles, then shouts --

                                 BARNEY
                   Ready... aim... fibre!
      Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough.     "Fibrefoam"
      pours into the mold.
107   THE CLAY MOLD                                                 107
      gets "winched" unpwards by monkeys, and then an alliga-
      torsaurus whaps it with its tail.
108   BELOW                                                         108
      Presto! A Fibrerock copy     of the stone sofa drops neatly
      out of the mold, bounces    lightly on the conveyor belt
      below! It sparkles with     the tell-tale celadon-green
      shimmer of Fibrerock. As     it chugs along, the process
      repeats, and soon a score    of identical sofas is in view.

109   END OF ASSEMBLY LINE                                          109
      as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the
      Fibrerock sofas (often one-handed). Nearby, we see
      Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc.

      Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands
      as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary,
      but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about
      to address them from his office balcony.
                              SLATE
                Men, this is a proud day for Slate
                Construction. You have seen the
                first pieces of Fibrerock roll
                off the assembly line and into
                history... a history you are all
                part of... thanks to your very
                own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone!

      They cheer Slate's remarks, pat Fred on the back.

                              SLATE
                No longer will man and beast bend
                under the backbreaking load of
                stone and rock and timber...
                because Fibrerock is so light
                that even a child can handle it.
                       (pause)
                That's why on Monday we're going
                to hire two dozen children from
                Bedrock Technical Junior High.
                They'll be replacing the 36
                heavy equipment operators, 15
                shaft diggers and 22 laborers
                we're laying off today. Your
                pink slips will be in your final
                pay envelopes along with a ticket
                to the grand opening of Slate
                City. It's non-transferable,
                so hang on to it. Thank you, and
                have a nice weekend.

      The workers stand slack-jawed and stunned.

      All eyes swivel and bore into Fred, who is as shocked as
      anyone.

                                BARNEY
                   Fred. You gotta do something
                   about this!

                   I mean, I do, yeah!

      He squares his shoulders, marches off.

116   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                    116

      Slate is practicing    hitting golf balls into an automatic
      putting cup. Lava     and some office workers are checking
      a blueprint against    a model of "Slate City" which is made
      out of Fibrerock.     A ball shoots back at Slate, who tees
      up again.
117   INSIDE THE PUTTING CUP                                       117
      A little MOUSE in a complete hockey outfit jumps to catch
      the ball. Stopping it with his little hockey stick, the
      Mouse gasps, raises its hockey mask.
                                  MOUSE
                   Whew.   And it's still pre-season.
      He whaps the ball to Slate again.


118   BACK TO SCENE                                                118
      Slate tees up the ball again. Fred barges in, banging
      the door. Startled, Slate drives the ball instead of
      putting it. It sails across the room and SHATTERS a
      PICTURE of Mrs. Slate.

                   Mr. Slate -- we gotta talk --
                                  SLATE
                   We do, eh?   About what?

                                 FRED
                   About those guys outside, Mr.
                   Slate. Some of 'em, well, they
                   been here for years. And you,
                   well, you can't lay them off just
                   like --
                          (snapping fingers)
                   -- that!

      Slate looks at Lava, who shrugs. Slate looks back at
      Fred, stays surprisingly calm. He toys with the putter,
      balances it on his palm.
                                 SLATE
                   Of course I can, Fred. I can lay
                   them off like --
                          (snapping fingers)
                   -- that, or like --
                          (a different style
                           snap)
                   -- that, or like --

      He does a really nifty snap which combines with a buck-
      and-wing with the putter.
                                 SLATE
                   -- that.

                          (bravura slipping)
                   Oh, you can, huh?
                                 LAVA
                   Of course he can, Flintstone.
                   It's his quarry.
                                 SLATE
                          (still calm, warm)
                   That's right. Why --
                          (chuckling)
                   I could lock the front door and go
                   fishing if I wanted!

      Lava laughs along with the office staff and Slate.      Fred
      chuckles a little to fit in.

      Lava quivers with mock surprise.     Everyone really laughs,
      now.

                   Slate, that's --
      Suddenly Fred stops laughing.
                                 SLATE
                   Flintstone, Lava, here,
                   recommended that you be in charge
                   of public relations to get
                   Fibrerock off to a good start.
                   I'm a member of that public,
                   Flintstone, and I have to say...
                   this isn't a good start. I'm
                   getting a bad feeling about
                   Fibrerock. A bad feeling about...
                   you. You want that feeling to go
                   away, don't you?
                                 FRED
                   Uh... well, gee, I... uh, yeah.
                                 SLATE
                   Good. Then turn around and walk
                   out of here and we'll forget all
                   about this.

      Fred swallows, looks at Lava, goes meekly out.

           that thing with Dino?           think so...?
      Pebbles turns, the decision made.

                                PEBBLES
                   Okay. We're gonna sing a song
                   with Dino.
      Instantly, on cue, Dino leaps out of nowhere, holding a
      straw hat and a cane.
      Wilma and Betty look at each other, skeptical. Bam-Bam
      reaches into his shirt and takes out a whistle. He blows
      it --

      MUSIC comes UP and Dino and his little friends do a dance
      routine we will call "The Dino Dance." It is a spectac-
      ular blend of soft-shoe and the kind of dog-and-pony-show
      gags usually seen in the circus or on the Ed Sullivrock
      show. Most importantly, the routine includes the
      following:

      A)    Dino leaps back and forth through a hoop.

      B)   The kids tie down a jump rope and Dino does a wire
           walk.

      C)   And finally, Dino uses his tail to flip the kids onto

      Pause as Fred waits for a reply. He turns... SHOT WIDENS
      as he realizes no one is sitting near him. He looks
      around and sees --
126   HIS POV - FRED'S POSTER                                        126

      It's been altered to read "Fred Finkstone." Also added
      to Fred's image are horns, a beard and other choice
      touches.
127   BACK TO SCENE                                                  127

      Fred looks around, sees Barney approaching, having just
      left a group of angry Buffalo.

                                 FRED
                   Barn -- w-what's going on?
                                 BARNEY
                   They're mad at you, Fred... it's
                   understandable, I mean, they all
                   got laid off today --
      Fred crosses to the other guys, puts on a big smile.
                                 FRED
                   Guys, guys, come on now -- what's a
                   quarry fulla layoffs got to do with
                   a lodge fulla Buffaloes?
                                 BARNEY
                   Is that a riddle? Give me a

                   -- You mean used to work for him --
                   until somebody opened their big
                   mouth --
                                 FRED
                   Fellas, come on. We're all big
                   boys here --
      He gestures vaguely towards the outside world, then back
      to the little band of brothers here.

                                 FRED
                   Surely we can separate in our minds
                   work, and play... Job, and Lodge...

                   Wait, wait... Your Antlerness,
                   please, one second -- !
      Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around,
      pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands
      him up center stage.
                                 FRED
                   Barney, you gotta tell the other
                   guys what really happened. Tell
                   'em the story behind Fibrerock.
                   The true story.
      The room quiets.    Barney clears his throat.     Fred waits,
      hopeful.
                                 BARNEY
                   Well, there's not much to tell.
                          (trying to remember
                           Fred's phraseology)
                   True, I got a cut... but Fred's
                   got a gut.

                                 FRED
                   No, no, the rest --!

                                 BARNEY
                   Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the
                   mind, but Fred's got the behind.
                   Right, Fred?

      Barney turns, gives Fred a big wink.    Fred groans.
                                 HERDMASTER
                   Thank you, Brother Rubble. The
                   Buffaloes will now have their
                   secret vote.

      Everyone pulls their horned fezzes down over their eyes.

                                 HERDMASTER
                   Paw... ground!
      Everyone does a bull-like stomp and scrape.

                   All for Piltdown, bellow now!
      The room ECHOES with MOOSE-LIKE SNORTS.

                                 HERDMASTER
                   All for Flintstone, bellow now!

      Fred snorts, sounding like Herb Alpert's lonely bull.
      Even under his furry fez we see him "looking around"
      desperately, hoping to hear one more snort.
      He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades
      away... finally, as Fred squirms miserably, there is one
      more lonely snort...
      ... from Barney, of course.
                                   HERDMASTER
                   Order furs!
      The fezzes come up.
                                 HERDMASTER
                   The snorts have it! Brother
                   Piltdown, it is my privilege to
                   install you as the new Exalted
                   Herdmaster Erect Antler and Big
                   Buck of our Lodge. If you'll come
                   forward, I will present you with
                   the tokens of office.
      Cheers and applause as Piltdown goes to the podium.

128   FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY                                       128
      Fred's a broken man.       Barney moves over, puts his arm
      around him.

                                 BARNEY
                   I voted for you, Fred.
                                 FRED
                   Big deal, after you screwed
                   everything up in the first
                   place...!
      Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench.
      Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it.

                                                           64.

      Piltdown accepts the festooned fez and shoulder ribbon,
      smiles at the group.

                              PILTDOWN
                Thank you, Brother Chairman.
                Fellow Buffaloes, I'm a man of few
                words. It's no secret that most
                of our lodge members are also
                members of Amalgamated Neolithic
                101... which means that most of us
                aren't gonna be able to make our
                cave payments next month. So my
                agenda for tonight... ends right
                now. There's a time to be a
                Buffalo... there's a time ta be a
                brown nosin' double-crossin'
                creep...
      All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back.
                              PILTDOWN
                ... and there's a time to stand up
                and be a man! So let's go down
                there and make the Slate shop into
                slate scrap... then we'll see how
                he gets along without the heavy
                equipment operators of Neolithic
                101! Meeting adjourned!

      With angry grumbles and threats, the meeting breaks up.
      Fezzes are thrown into cubby holes and hard hats are
      slapped on. The Buffalo run out.
      When the dust clears, we see that only one member has
      avoided the herding instinct: Barney.
      Now, he turns, runs into --

130   BUFFALO LODGE - RECREATION AREA - NIGHT                    130
      Fred is at the bar, opening a beer. He looks wistfully
      at the old, framed picture on the wall -- reacts as he
      sees --
131   PICTURE                                                    131

      Even his childhood shot has been defaced.
132   BACK TO SCENE                                              132

      He sets his jaw with a "screw 'em" expression, downs his
      beer. Then Barney runs up, shakes him by the shoulders.

                   No, no, not that! Piltdown's got
                   the guys all worked up and they're
                   heading down to the quarry!
                   They're gonna wreck the assembly

                   We could end up with half a
                   percent of nothing!

                   No, Fred, if they do that they'll
                   be breakin' the law! Our brother
                   Buffalo could go to jail!
                                 FRED

      gate. Down the road, we see Piltdown leading the angry
      mob. Quickly, they go to the gate, climb up and over it!

                   Okay! Let's start with Slate's
                   golf trophies and work our way
                   up to the assembly line!
      AD LIB angry cheers, and the mob storms into the plant,
      knocking aside equipment and supplies.

                   things ever get this out of

                                 BARNEY
                   I know. Makes you wish things
                   were back the way they were...
                   before we was big executives.
                                 FRED
                   Well, I wouldn't go that far...
      Suddenly they're interrupted by the sound of a SIREN.
      Fred looks back and sees --

135   FELDSPAR AND GRAVEL                                            135
      Coming up from rear. Feldspar grabs his megaphone as he
      pulls abreast of Fred.

                   Oh, no, not now...
      Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder.       Fred smiles,
      nods...
136   CLOSE ON FRED'S FEET                                           136
      He slams them down through the floorboard --

137   WIDER                                                          137
      Fred's CAR SKIDS, spins out, whirling around like a
      record on a turntable. It jerks to a halt 180 degrees
      later, and then ROARS off in the opposite direction.
138   FELDSPAR                                                       138

      So astonished he follows this action with his head... a
      bad move because --

                                  GRAVEL

      The patrol CAR runs off the road, CRASHING into a stone
      fire hydrant. Water squirts into the air. Feldspar and
      Gravel are drenched. They're just coming to their senses
      when the ground heaves -- the car's front wheels rise --

                                                               67.

      As we see that the water spout is actually coming from
      the blowhole of a whale which now sticks a bit of its
      head up from under the broken curb.

141   SLATE QUARRY - NIGHT                                           141

      Led by Piltdown, the workers have grabbed a big timber
      which they're using like a battering ram on the doors of
      the assembly line building. Suddenly, with a crash, the
      doors go down! Piltdown and Pyrite stand back while the
      angry workers rush past them.
                                PILTDOWN
                         (loudly)
                  Now we'll show 'em who's boss!
                                PYRITE
                  They can't push us around!
      Piltdown and Pyrite smash a few items to get everybody
      juiced up, and then... when no one is looking...
      ... they slip out the back!
142   REAR OF QUARRY - NIGHT                                         142
      Fred pulls into the lot, slams his feet down to stop --
      we hear SKIDDING -- they fishtail all over, slam right
      through a storage area for crates and barrels which
      collapse all around them.

      Finally they slam broadside into the main Quarry build-
      ing, knocking a hole in the wall.
143   NEW ANGLE                                                      143

      Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of
      them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole
      in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe...

      ... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now
      jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand
      drill.

      Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the
      tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away,
      vanishing just as our heroes stir.

                   Barn! Did you see that -- ?
                          (peering through
                           the dust)
                   -- Huh, now it's gone... I

                                   BARNEY
                   Come on Fred.    Time to earn those
                   big bucks.

      They rush into the plant.
144   INT. ASSEMBLY LINE - NIGHT                                  144

      As the workers continue their rampage, Piltdown and
      Pyrite reappear.
                                 PYRITE
                   Darn that Flintstone and Rubble...
                   they're gonna screw everything
                   up...

                                 PILTDOWN
                   Not if we give 'em a nice long
                   vacation... in the hospital.
      Saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench. Then some
      rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour-
      aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some
      stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite
      begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while
      Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams
      which he flings below.
145   CLOSE - PYRITE                                              145

      Winds up for another   baseball-type swing -- but as he
      follows through, the   ball-shaped light fixture jerks up
      on its cable. Unable    to stop in time, Pyrite spins
      around, falls on his   ass.
      Barney drops down INTO VIEW, hanging horizontally from
      the rafters. He's holding the light fixture with his
      free hand.

                                 BARNEY
                   Stee-rike one! Heh-hey.    Ready
                   for a curve ball?

      Pyrite doesn't have a sense of humor; club in hand,
      he jumps up, starts chasing Barney through the rafters.

                                                             69.

      Spits on his hand, grabs another big beam. He pulls down
      on it... but it doesn't snap, it goes right up again.
      Puzzled, he pulls down on it again... there's another
      see-saw motion...
      ... This time Piltdown goes with the flow, pushes up and
      peers under the beam...

      Fred is hanging on the other end.

                                FRED
                  Brother Piltdown... can we talk
                  about this, antler to antler?

      Piltdown roars, begins slamming the girder up and down.
                                 FRED
                  Guess not...
      Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. Freed
      of Fred's weight, the other end "BOINGS" down on
      Piltdown's head. He groans, recovers in time to chase
      after Fred.
148   BARNEY AND PYRITE                                            148
      Square off in the rafters.
                                BARNEY
                  Give me your best shot.
      Pyrite swings. Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW
      pane. Barney dodges again and the same thing happens.
      Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time...

      ... but this time the window is hinged in the center and
      the swivel action after the hit whaps Barney on the back
      and knocks him into Pyrite's next blow.

149   FRED                                                         149
      Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super-
      structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot in
      an arc in front of him.

                                FRED
                  Dare you to cross that line.

      Piltdown crosses it.

                                 FRED
                  That line.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

      Piltdown crosses it. Fred "marks" another one. Piltdown
      doesn't even wait for the challenge, takes a giant step.
      Oops. Bad idea: The last "line" was at the edge of a
      straight drop! Piltdown yelps, "treads air" in the best
      cartoon manner -- and then desperately grabs a handful of
      Fred's clothing! Both men fall -- at the last minute
      Piltdown catches a ladder!

150   BELOW - ASSEMBLY LINE                                      150
      Fred lands with a thud right in the clay mold used to
      form the Fibre products! Worse, the impact arouses the
      goatasauruses out of their sleep. Dutifully, they rise,
      and then ram both sides of the mold just as Fred is
      struggling to his feet! Fred's yell is muffled by the
      clay.

151   OTHER ASSEMBLY LINE ANIMALS                                151
      Aroused by the "start up" of the assembly line, they do
      their job. Fibre foam begins to chug down the trough:
      The alligator crane picks up the mold, shakes it.
152   FRED                                                       152
      is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay.
153   THE FIBRE MOLD                                             153

      The real Fred, moving stiffly like a robot, is getting
      to his feet when his Fibre doppleganger slams him to the
      mat again! A moment later, another "Fred" drops down
      beside him.

155   PILTDOWN                                                   155
      Has descended the ladder, hopping mad. Now, he sees
      Fred coming toward him... Piltdown breaks a big lever off
      the equipment, swings -- reacts astonished as "FRED"
      SHATTERS.

156   FRED                                                       156

      Back down the line, he's seen this. His clay-caked
      Adam's apple gulps. Quickly, he turns and tries to
      "tip-toe" away -- then, with a CREAK and CRUNCH -- the
      clay and Fibre all over him solidifies! Desperate, he
      tries to move... can't!

                                                             71.

      Watches, confused, as dozens of Fred Flintstones chug
      towards him on the belt. He shrugs, smashes the next
      one in line. Another phoney. He smashes the next one...

      Dodging Pyrite's renewed attack. Now, Barney becomes
      aware of the activated assembly line. Getting an idea,
      he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber
      stamp.
      Pyrite comes around the    corner... Barney's head butts him
      in the gut, dodges under    his legs! Then, as Pyrite
      stumbles, Barney stamps    his ass with the word "REJECT."
      Pyrite looks back, sees    this, reddens... raises his club.
                               PYRITE
                 Reject, huh? Whaddya say we
                 reject your head?
      He raises the club... when an alligator swings down and
      grabs him by the seat of his pants! Pyrite drops the
      club, howls --
159   WIDER                                                        159
      The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin
      marked REJECTS -- and drops him.
      Howling, Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and
      defective Fibrerock goods.

160   BARNEY                                                       160
      Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts.
      CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet
      another of the duplicate Freds.
      Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above
      the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps
      into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the
      Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --

161   BELOW                                                        161

      Piltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when
      Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into
      him and Fred! All three of them roll across the floor
      towards --

                                                               72.

162   THE END OF THE BUILDING                                        162
      where a squad of policemen has just appeared -- led by a
      dripping wet Feldspar and Gravel!

                               FELDSPAR
                All right!   You're all under arr --

      Wham! Barney, Fred and Piltdown roll right into the
      cops, who go flying like (what else?) tenpins, complete
      with appropriate sound.
                              BARNEY
                       (sitting up)
                Whattya know. Even got the spare
                again...

      Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has
      just fallen off!
      Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay
      and Fibre shoulders. Before he can extricate himself
      further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of
      the building.

                   The day after Slate City opens
                   there's going to be an audit. If
                   the stuff isn't gone by then we'll
                   all be doing time until the
                   Bronze Age.

                   Don't worry, Mister Lava... we're
                   on top of it.
      They both turn and start down an alley... jamming
      together as they do. Lava sighs... then jumps as Barney
      comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.
                                 BARNEY
                   Excuse me, Mister Lava -- ? I
                   think you oughta know... something
                   could be wrong with the Fibrerock

                   It tastes different.

                                 BARNEY
                   Yup. See, ever since I started
                   with Fibrerock -- I mean, since
                   me and Fred started with it, I
                   always take a little taste of the
                   Fibre foam. And tonight's batch,
                   well... I didn't get much of it,
                   but it seems a little off.

                   an ingredient missing. So

165   INT. SLATE'S OFFICE - DAY                                  165
      Slate and Lava are examining a newer and larger model of
      Slate City. It's even more grandiose than its
      predecessor. Now the housing development has two huge
      office buildings beside it, and then a convention center
      beyond that.

                              LAVA
                ... As you can see, the Fibrerock
                is so light we're using it for
                construction, for furnishings...
                for everything. You can't stack
                a two-bedroom cave this high...
                but the sky's the limit with

                they... they practically scrape
                the sky! We should call them...
                Slate scrapers!

                That's brilliant, Unc... Mister

      Slate's so busy admiring his moment to himself he hardly
      listens to what Lava's saying, just runs his stylus
      through the wet clay of the statements, meanwhile
      "framing" the model city in his hands.
                                 LAVA

      Lava breaks off.    He's just looked out the window and
      seen --

166   LAVA'S POV - QUARRY BELOW WINDOW                             166
      A small figure appears behind some of the equipment,
      tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards
      the assembly line.
      Wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook-on
      beard, it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre
      hermit or bum... and then we realize, hey, this is
      Barney!

      Looks around, spots Piltdown and Pyrite, now resplendent
      in security guard uniforms. Lava whistles softly to get
      their attention, can't. Then he sees one of Slate's
      golf trophies. He shrugs, throws it.

168   BELOW - PILTDOWN                                             168
      Reacts as the trophy bounces off his head, then looks up
      to see Lava gesticulating. Piltdown nods, grabs Pyrite
      in tow.

      Looking around carefully, Barney takes out a Thermos
      bottle, unscrews the top, and quickly dunks it into the
      Fibrerock foam. Then he tiptoes O.S., right into the
      massive bulk of --

      side.

      drops and SHATTERS, drag him O.S. --

      Barney is tossed outside, landing in a heap amidst the
      picketing workers of Neolithic 101.

                that's what I like about you.

      Technicians roll out gear, set up big spotlights, etc.

      Rockin' Leach is surveying the place with an aide. Fred
      and Wilma are with them. Leach makes a "frame" with his

                   Hmm. Lovely little guest 'ouse,
                   Mister Flintstone. So simple,
                   so ordinary, so unexceptional...
                   why, h'it's almost quaint. Let's
                   say we start with the camera 'ere,
                   except...

      Leach breaks off, looks over the fence at the Rubble
      homestead. He shakes his head sadly.

                                 FRED
                   W-what's wrong?
                                 LEACH
                   Well, just look at that yard over
                   there... barbecues and trikes, not
                   exactly the right image...
                                 FRED
                          (pointing)
                   Maybe you could move those plants
                   to block them out...?

                                 LEACH
                   Good idea. Rodney, get 'hoppin'
                   with those greens.
      The aide nods, gathers some workers. They start moving
      the potted plants. Puzzled, Wilma comes over.
                                 WILMA
                   Fred, this was supposed to be a
                   'typical evening' at the
                   Flintstones, and you invited fifty
                   people I don't even know. Now
                   what's going on? Where are they
                   taking my ficus-sauruses?
                                 FRED
                   It's the Rubble yard, Wilma.   It's
                   just not the right image...
      He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and
      trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses
      a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good
      measure.
179   BARNEY AND BETTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                          179

      Betty, hair and face done, but still in a slip, is
      putting a reluctant Bam-Bam into a cute little blazer.
      In the f.g., Barney finishes tying a black tie, then
      struggles into a dinner jacket.

                   Fred's in a high-powered
                   executive job, Betty. There's a
                   lot of pressure on him.
                                 BETTY
                   Yeah... and it's all around his
                   belt. If it wasn't for poor Wilma
                   I wouldn't give him the Geological
                   Time --

                   Trust me, Betty. After the
                   Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same
                   old Fred.
      Both react to the sound of HAMMERING and SAWING.
      Curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the
      yard and see --
180   THEIR POV - THE FENCE                                          180
      The television crew has just finished nailing boards up
      over the top of the fence. Now the big potted plants
      are dropped into place. With each hammer stroke or thud
      a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off
      until Barney and Betty are in shadow.
      Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza
      dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird
      bath. One last stray end lands on Barney's head.

      it catches.

      crew members who are busy with scissors and combs and
      brushes.

      Finally, they're done and leave him.

      He has been cut and trimmed like a French poodle. He
      gets a glimpse of himself in the swimming pool and freaks
      out. Then he arches his back, shakes out the hairstyle.

      Barney and Betty appear, Bam-Bam in tow. They come out
      into the yard. Betty waves at Wilma, who comes over,
      whispers.

                Thank heaven. There isn't one

                Well, Rockin', you're right, I
                have affected destiny for all
                mankind, and it's a sobering
                thought. However, if I may add a
                personal note at this time, I
                myself cannot personally take
                all the credit for Fibrerock...

      other by a gangway six stories up. Block letters on the
      Fibresphere proclaim "Slate Construction brings you THE
      WONDERFUL WORLD OF FIBRE." A heroic statue of Slate
      himself stands close by the structures. (Sphere and
      needle, of course, are dead on parodies of the Trylon
      and Perisphere, centerpieces of the '39 World's Fair.)
      A limousine pedaled by two chauffeurs pulls up. Mr. and
      Mrs. Slate and Lava, and Lava's son, POINDEXTER, get out.
      It is immediately evident that the little obnoxious acorn
      hasn't fallen far from the tree.

                Of course, Poindexter, of course.
      They head for the mastodon    and pully-powered elevator.
      Standing there are Piltdown    and Pyrite, both in security
      guard uniforms. (Piltdown     is carrying a vaguely-familiar
      satchel). Lava gives them     a big look. They nod. As
      the elevator rises, his two    cronies duck into a stairwell
      marked "NO ADMITTANCE."

      The party is in full swing.

      We see Pebbles and Bam-Bam squirming uncomfortably in
      their party clothes. They take some canapes off of a
      table, take a bite... spit them out.
195   FRED                                                           195

      Stands beaming, nodding to his guests.

                                 FRED
                   Hello, hello. Bon soir. Good to
                   see ya... glad you could make it...

                                 GUEST
                          (unconvincingly)
                   Hello, Frank...

                                 FRED
                   Fred -- there's the bar, make
                   yourself at home -- mi casa es
                   votre casa, so, when in Rome and
                   all that --
                                 WILMA
                          (coming over)
                   Fred, can I talk to you -- ?
                   Fred? Fred?
                          (concerned)
                   We have a serious problem with
                   Betty and Barney.
                                 FRED
                          (alarmed)
                   You mean you can see their
                   house -- ?
                                 WILMA
                          (exasperated)
                   I mean you're treating them
                   horribly! What's come over you,
                   Fred? Does a little money mean so
                   much to you that you just turn
                   your back on the things that
                   really count?
                                 FRED
                   Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do
                   that. Okay, I admit it: I'm
                   trying to make an impression here,
                   I wanna look good, I wanna be a
                   success...

      He takes her hand, looks into her eyes.       For a moment,
      Wilma's face softens.

      She throws up her hands, stalks away.

                   What'd I say?

      Hangs up the sea shell phone, runs over to Leach.
                                 P.A.
                   That was our location guy at Slate
                   City. They just moved the ribbon
                   cutting up by an hour. Guests are
                   already starting to arrive.

                   Fabulous! I've 'ad enough crab meat
                   and crabgrass to last me a year.
                   All right, boys, that's a wrap!
197   FRED                                                           197
      In the middle of a tight little group which is pigging
      out. Fred seems oblivious to the fact that they're
      oblivious to him.

                                 FRED
                   ... Yas, yas, it's a challenging
                   commodity market these days.
                   Personally, I'm considering
                   petrified forests, but they do
                   say that volcano futures are
                   ready to explode, ha, ha...

      Suddenly Fred notices that his "audience" has evaporated.
      He looks around, sees everyone headed for their cars,
      the TV crew packing up, etc.
                                 FRED
                   ... Hey, whoa, what's happening --

                   Fred!
      He stumbles through the thinning crowd, clutching at
      elbows.

                                 FRED
                   Hey, what's the hurry? We got a
                   cake shaped like a piece of
                   Fibrerock... I got it, how about
                   some charades? No, even better,
                   twenty questions: 'Am I animal,
                   mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I
                   heard a great one the other day
                   ... a guy walks in a bar with a
                   duckasaurus on his head and the
                   bartender says -- this'll kill
                   you, the bartender says --
      Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of
      glory. He stands alone on the lawn. Wilma slowly comes
      up to him.

                                 WILMA
                   Fred... I... I'm sorry it's not
                   working out...
      Fred turns, puts on a big smile.
                                 FRED
                   Whaddya mean, not working out?
                   They're goin' party hopping,
                   that's all. That's what ya do in
                   society, Wilma... you cruise
                   around. They'll go over to
                   Slate's shindig for a while,
                   then they'll come back here.

                                 FRED
                   You go on over to Slate City,

                   Nah, me and some of the guys from
                   the country club, we're gonna play
                   poker, yeah, big stakes poker
                   until everybody comes back. Go on
                   with the others. The kids got
                   their show to put on anyway... and
                   I wouldn't want people to think...
                   to think the Flintstones were
                   party poopers.

      She doesn't know what to say, or what she can say that
      won't shatter his shaky image. She sighs, kisses him,
      then calls out.

                                 WILMA
                   Come on, Pebbles. We're going to
                   another party.
                                 PEBBLES
                   Will there be real food there?
                                 WILMA
                   We'll find out together.
      She takes the girl's hand and goes to the door, where the
      last of Leach's crew is just going out. Suddenly Betty
      catches up to her, Bam-Bam in tow.

                                  BETTY
                   Wilma, wait.   I'm going with you.
                                  WILMA
                   Why?
                                 BETTY
                   If friends can't do something
                   stupid, who can?
      Wilma smiles, touched.

                                 BETTY
                   Besides...
                          (lowering her voice)
                   ... Maybe if we leave the boys
                   alone...?

      Wilma nods, hopeful.
198   EXT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT                                198

      The film crew caravan   is already leaving as Wilma, Betty
      and the kids get into   the Rubble car. The last TV crew-
      man extinguishes the   big spotlight. The house is dark,
      forlorn in the fading   twilight.

                                                            90.

199   REAR OF YARD - NIGHT                                        199
      Fred sits forlorn in the rubble of his party.   Dino comes
      over, nuzzles his leg.

                              FRED
                Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah.
                That's okay. Man and man's best
                friend.

      He gives Dino one of the canapes. Dino tastes it, makes
      a face, spits it out. DINO runs off, going "PTOOIE" all
      the way. We see him run to the corner, jump in Betty's
      car and drive away.
200   FRED                                                        200

      sighs, looks around, down at his blazer and the "FVF"
      patch. He suddenly rips it off in a fury. Then he looks
      at --
201   THE WALL IN FRONT OF BARNEY'S PROPERTY                      201
202   BACK TO SCENE                                               202
      Fred stares at it, his face slowly darkening. Then he
      grabs a lawn chair from the yard, begins to smash it in
      a fury against the divider. The wall cracks, splinters;
      the potted plants go flying.
203   FRED                                                        203
      His anger spent, he stands panting, splattered with
      dirt... then he sees --
204   NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER DIRT-COVERED FIGURE                     204
      -- standing in the ruins of the wall. The figure
      sneezes, whacks dirt off of itself. It's --

                          (smiling)
                   I've had lots of practice.

                   Aw, Barn...
      And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug. Tears in both
      their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two
      prehistoric sensitive guys.

205   FIBRESPHERE & SLATE NEEDLE - NIGHT                            205

      Little cupola cars are chugging around the upper level
      of the Fibresphere, where they enter a tunnel-like open-
      ing labeled "THE WORLD OF FIBRE."

      Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino are in one of these.

                Welcome! Welcome to the fabulous

      REVEALING that behind the hollow shells of the human
      family is a veritable family of monkeys, all working the
      figures like puppets. A PARROT at a stand-mounted
      microphone is giving the narration.
                              PARROT (RECORDING) (V.O.)
                Here, we see a typical family of
                the future, free of the cares and
                worries of today... yes, the great
                kibble crisis is a thing of the
                past when you're living the good
                life... the Fibrelife!

      The CARS CHUG past a display of tree trunks, leaves,
      bubbling gunk... and those iridescent vegetable pearls
      we've come to know... coo-coo berries. Iron bars and
      vault-like doors separate the coo-coo berries from the
      other items.
                              ANOTHER PARROT
                Here, gathered from the four
                corners of the globe, are the
                secret ingredients of Fibrerock...
                some common, some rare... all
                making life easier for you and
                yours!

      The little CARS CHUG into an elegant salon, complete with
      runway. There's another PARROT here in front of another
      megaphone, but this parrot is chic and flamboyant.
                              FASHION PARROT
                But does Fibrerock belong only in
                the kitchen, the garage, the
                workplace? No, no, no, my
                darlings!

      As each girl struts forward, she shrugs off a bulky
      animal fur and tosses it into a garbage can. Underneath
      are all kinds of daring and tantalizing fashions woven
      in the tell-tale fibre colors. The clothes are a blend
      of the future and retro (that is, prehistoric retro).

                wonder of Fibrerockfibre, the world

      Now, we see a display of Fibrerock props of all kinds --
      appliances, toys, tools, etc... all of it upstaged by a
      choir consisting of every animal, bird and critter we've
      seen in this film. Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino ooh
      and ahh with the other guests as the mechanical animals
      all sing in unison --

212   INT. BARNEY'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT                               212
      Fred and Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and
      memorabilia. They have their arms around each other and
      are singing.
                              FRED & BARNEY
                'Now it's time to do or die, grab
                that rock and kick it high, let's
                fight, fight, fight for Bedrock
                High!'

      They break up laughing. Fred chuckles, looks at one of
      the many old photographs strewn around.
                              FRED
                Boy, those were the days, Barney.
                Bedrock High winning all those
                games... and you and me right in
                the middle of it.

                                                            94.

213   NEW ANGLE - FAVORING PHOTO                                  213
      The photograph (dots in stone) shows the young Fred and
      Barney in their cheerleading costumes. Barney has a
      sweater and megaphone; Fred is in a Godzilla-like
      "mascot" costume. He's holding the hideously-sculpted
      head under his arm.

                              BARNEY
               Yeah.   Too bad we never made the
               team.
                             FRED
               So what? We made the team spirit.
               That's just as important...
               whatever happened to those
               cheerleader costumes?

                             BARNEY
               You know Betty. She never throws
               anything away.
      He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it.    There they
      are.
                               FRED
                        (rummaging in it)
               Boy.    Talk about memories.
      Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins,
      pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old
      "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally,
      he can zip it up, stern to stem.
                             FRED
               Back then, we thought a pop quiz
               was a big problem. We didn't
               know how good we had it. No
               problems, no worries...

      Saying this, Fred attempts to put on the Godzilla-like
      head. He has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail
      behind his neck, an even harder time swinging it down and
      forward.
                             BARNEY
               Speaking of problems and worries,
               shouldn't we get on over to
               Slate's party?
      Fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into
      place. Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in
      sync.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                95.

                                 FRED
                          (echo-y)
                   What for? So him and all his
                   fancy friends can look down their
                   noses at us?

      Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit, Fred
      steps over to Barney, stabs an angry claw in his
      direction.
                                 FRED
                          (echo-y)
                   All they've been doing is using us,
                   Barney. And meanwhile --

      Now Fred reaches up to take the head off. It sticks for
      a moment. Finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge
      where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood.
                                 FRED
                          (normal voice)
                   -- Meanwhile all the time they
                   were laughing at us.

                                  BARNEY
                   Yeah?   When did you notice that?
                                 FRED
                   About an hour ago.
                                 BARNEY
                   Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred.
      Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING,
      a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall
      apart.

      Fred and Barney look at each other, startled, then rush
      over to the model. It's the interim version we saw
      earlier.

      The decomposition continues, walls and supports turning
      into sand and running down before our eyes. In a Rube
      Goldberg-like continuum, the little houses go first,
      falling like dominoes...
                                 FRED
                   Wha... what's happening?

      Barney tries to stop the process, can't.

                   I... I don't know... the Fibrerock
                   it's... it's decomposing... but
                   this shouldn't happen...
                                 FRED
                   Your old models are just fine...

      Indeed, the older models from Barney's tinkering days
      are rock solid.
216   BACK TO SCENE                                                216

                                 BARNEY
                   It should be. There's enough
                   coo-coo berry resin in there to
                   petrify a brontosaurus --
      Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models
      to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing
      awareness.

                                 BARNEY
                          (snapping his fingers)
                   -- The coo-coo berries! Fred,
                   that's it!

                                FRED
                   What's it?
                                 BARNEY
                   Remember I said the Fibrefoam
                   tasted funny? It was the coo-coo
                   sap that was missing!

                                 FRED
                   But.. why would --
                                 BARNEY
                   Why? Because coo-coo berries are
                   as valuable as goldrock! And
                   we've had tons of 'em delivered
                   to the plant since we started...
                   somebody musta got greedy --

                                 FRED
                   -- Not 'somebody' -- Lava!

                                 BARNEY
                          (alarmed)
                   Fred, that sap acts as a fixative
                   -- it's the glue that holds the
                   whole formula together -- !

                   there --
      With a final WHIMPER, the little FIBRESPHERE CAVES IN
      and then the nearby SLATE NEEDLE CRUMBLES, model story
      by model story. Finally the "DISK" on top of the needle
      is all that's left, wobbling around like a spun dinner
      plate. It finally falls... EXPLODES.
                                 FRED
                          (worried)
                   -- B-barney... what do we do?

      Barney runs to a locker, grabs a big plunger-powered
      flit gun, begins filling it with a red liquid.
                                 BARNEY
                   Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's
                   our only chance -- their only
                   chance!
      Barney gives it a quick test squirt. Fred nods, and they
      rush out of the room. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ruins of
      the model "Slate City"...

      and simultaneously singing with a ventriloquist's dummy.
      Obviously, the talent show has begun.
      In the audience, Lava fidgets with nervous and confident
      energy... gives Wilma a big look.

                   You're certainly looking lovely
                   this evening, Mrs. Flintstone.

                   Oh?   Is Fred getting promoted?
      Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The
      ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid
      bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the
      stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al
      steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the
      expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing
      endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the
      distant volcanic ridge.

                   zee years --
      She gestures into the audience, where Mrs. Slate stands,
      waves a gloved hand like the Queen Mother.

                   -- An' now, what better
                   introduction could we 'ave for
                   Mrs. Slate's vairy own gran'
                   nephew... Poindexter Lava!
      She steps aside. Curtain rises on little Poindexter.
      He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion. He begins
      to play:
                                 POINDEXTER

      Their smiles become fixed. (Up on the spotlights, the
      little birds who operate the lights put earplugs in their
      ears.)
      In the wings with Pebbles and Bam-Bam, DINO MOANS, hides
      his head under his paws.

      On the refreshment table, GLASSES CRACK... a cake falls.
219   CLOSE ON LAVA                                                219

      He surreptitiously checks his wrist watch...

220   INT. EMPTY FIBRERIDE - TIGHT ON ANOTHER WATCH - NIGHT        220

      This one a pocket job. (Like Lava's, it's really a
      little sundial with a built-in burning match above it to
      provide a shadow!) We WIDEN, and see that this watch
      is held in a green, scaley claw.
221   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                221

      It's the xenosaurus, lurking behind the   exhibits! Now,
      the CREATURE GRUNTS confidently, lights   up a cigar.
      Then it picks up a canvas bag and a big   toolbox and
      tiptoes into the deeper recesses of the   Fibre ride.

222   INT. FRED'S CAR - TRAVELLING                                 222
      Fred and Barney rush along, Fred at the wheel.
                              FRED
                What'll we do when we get there?

                              BARNEY
                We just tell Mister Slate that all
                500 acres of his development are
                going to crumble into dust any
                minute.
                       (holds up the
                        flit gun)
                Then we zap the stairs and
                corridors with some of this
                coo-coo sap. I just hope we have
                enough to get everybody out --
                whoops!

      He's said this last because as he held up the flit gun,
      the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume,
      and the head has flipped down with a solid "clink."

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              100.

                          (swerving all
                           over the road)
                   -- I can't see straight --

      Barney gets up on his knees, grabs the wheel with one
      hand and the monster head with the other.
                                 BARNEY
                   Hang on, hang on --

      Oops. He rotates the head completely around. Fred
      flails around. Barney grabs the wheel with one hand,
      tries to help Fred with the other.

223   EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                               223
      It careens around even more wildly now.      There's several
      near collisions.
                                                    CUT TO:
224   EXT. "ROCKDONALD'S" RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         224
      "Rockdonald's" is, of course, complete with golden arches
      of stone, a drive-up window, etc. It even has the oblig-
      atory cops on a break... in this case, Feldspar and
      Gravel. They're sitting in their patrol car eating from
      little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonald's
      Styrofoam. (Of course, the logo on the building behind
      them proudly reads "OVER 100 SOLD.")
                                 FELDSPAR
                          (mouth full, bitching)
                   Speed traps again! Face it,
                   Gravel. I'm in a rut... and
                   meanwhile, the guys who went
                   through the academy with me,
                   they're all big shots now:
                   Sam Slate... Dirty Harock...
                   Magma, P.I. And you know why?
                   'Cause they got the breaks,
                   that's why!

      Suddenly both officers react to the sound of SKIDDING
      TIRES and HONKING HORNS. They look out their window
      at --
225   FRED AND BARNEY - DRIVING PAST                                 225

      both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume
      head. (By now their gyrations have put Barney's face
      inside the jaws of the monster mask.)

                                                            101.

                              GRAVEL
                S-sarge, d-did you see that? Some
                sorta creature was attacking that
                little guy -- !
                              FELDSPAR
                There's a lesson there, Gravel...
                never pick up hitchhikers.
                Besides --
                       (realizing)
                -- Did you say 'creature'?

      They do a big double-take at the now-vanishing car.
                              FELDSPAR & GRAVEL
                The xenosaurus!

      Excited, Feldspar bangs his dashboard and a DISPATCH
      PARAKEET in a police uniform pops INTO VIEW. Feldspar
      grabs it around the neck, holds it like a microphone.
                              FELDSPAR
                This is a xenosaurus alert.
                Repeat, a xenosaurus alert. The
                creature has been sighted on the
                Slate City exit of the Venturock
                Freeway! It is driving a brown
                late model sedan and eating a
                white male Caucasian. Car twelve
                is in hot pursuit.
      He releases the bird, which doesn't fly away right away,
      but gives him a look.

                              FELDSPAR
                       (remembering)
                Oh, yeay... over and out!

      The bird nods, appeased, flies off.
                              DISPATCH PARAKEET
                       (as it goes)
                Awwk! Car Twelve is on the way.
                Car Twelve is on the way...

                              FELDSPAR
                       (thrilled)
                Gravel, this could mean promotions
                for both of us!
                       (trotting up to
                        speed)
                Load the shotgun and turn on the
                siren!

                                                          102.

227   FRED'S CAR - TRAVELLING                                    227
      Barney is rocking Fred's head back and forth, finally
      gives it one last mighty yank. Something breaks.
      Barney falls back on the passenger side of the car.
      Fred drives with one hand, "raps" the monster head.
      It rattles. When Fred speaks again, the monster mouth
      no longer opens and closes in sync.

                              FRED
                       (muffled, shouting)
                Ho, gweat! Hoo bwoke hit,
                Bahnee! Hi khnat twalk hennymore!
      Suddenly both men (pardon, man and xenosaurus) react to
      an approaching SIREN. They both look back at --

228   FELSPAR'S PATROL CAR                                      228
      Closing in. Gravel has produced a little sabre tooth
      CAT and is "cranking" its tail. As it WAILS away, the
      cops close in on our heroes.
229   BACK TO SCENE                                             229

                What, and explain what you're
                doing in that costume? Start
                talking about coo-coo berries and
                Fibrerock? By then it'll be too
                late!
                              FRED
                'Hen yore height, yore height...
      Fred pours on more speed. They careen around a turn.
      CAMERA WHIP PANS TO a road sign: SLATE CITY--1 MI.

230   SLATE CITY - REAR GATE                                    230
      A fence surrounds the empty housing development; in the
      distance, we can see the dark Slate Scrapers, and past
      them, the brightly-lit and gleaming Fibersphere and
      Slate Needle.
      We hear a SCREECH and then the CAMERA PANS BACK to pickup
      Fred's CAR as it whips around a turn, two wheels off the
      ground. It crashes right into the gate, knocking down a
      sign reading "SLATE CITY--DELIVERY GATE." The fence
      collapses all around the car.

                                                             103.

      Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck. Barney,
      covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with
      relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is
      still intact.
                                BARNEY
                         (hearing a siren)
                  We'd better split up; that way at
                  least one of us can make it to the
                  Slate Needle -- !

                  'Ood hidea.   Ood whuk, ol' bhudee.
      They slap hands together like basketball players, then
      head off in two directions.

      CAMERA PANS the audience as the accordion recital con-
      tinues. Several people look visibly ill. Finally,
      CAMERA ADJUSTS to take in Poindexter's big finish as he
      slides forward on his knees.
      There's a scattering of half-hearted applause, led by
      Lava and the Slates.

                                HEADMISTRESS
                  Sank you, sank you. Our nex'

                         (checking notes)
                  ... an' friend.
      She steps aside as a spotlight picks out --

233   PEBBLES, BAM-BAM & DINO                                   233
      poised in the stances we recognize as the "first
      positions" of the "Dino Dance." However, whereas the
      previous version of this was done impromptu and
      a cappella with only a few primitive props and straw
      hats alone, this time the kids and Dino are fully
      costumed, with sequins, batons and the like, and the
      dance is completely choreographed.

                                KIDS
                  You can keep the twist,

      As the Dino dance begins, FULL ORCHESTRATION OVER IT.
      The audience seems to really like it -- all except --

                                                             104.

      who glances over at the judges long enough to see that
      they like this a lot better than the accordion act.
      Suddenly Mrs. Slate jumps up, barges on stage. The
      MUSIC DIES.
                                 HEADMISTRESS
                   Madame Slate, what ees wrong -- ?

                                 MRS. SLATE
                   I'll tell you what's wrong! This
                   'act' is an absolute disgrace!
                   This is supposed to be a talent
                   show!  And a pedestrian animal act
                   like this belongs in a circus!

236   WILMA AND BETTY                                           236

      React, furious, jump out of their seats.
                                 BETTY
                   A circus, huh? Well, if our kids
                   belong in a circus with their act,
                   then your little nephew belongs in
                   a zoo with his --
                                 WILMA
                   Yeah -- a zoo where the animals
                   are dead -- because if they aren't,
                   they will be!
                                 MRS. SLATE
                   Why, how dare you! Mrs.
                   Flintstein, I'll have you know
                   that my little Poindexter has been
                   trained by the finest tutors!
                   Poindexter! Show them! Encore!

      The kid jumps up, begins to play. Immediately another
      GLASS SHATTERS. But then the CEILING FIXTURES CRACK,
      and then the PICTURE WINDOW PANELS begin to SHATTER one
      by one.

                                 MRS. SLATE
                          (alarmed)
                   Ah... Poindexter... that's enough
                   ... Poindexter...?

      The kids stops... But another WINDOW PANEL EXPLODES.
      Then one of the tables collapses.

      Pause. Every head in the room swivels around and stares
      at Poindexter. Nervous, he tosses the accordion aside.
      But the destruction continues: Another WINDOW PANEL
      SHATTERS. Then, the entire building shakes.

                                                             105.

      Loses his balance, grabs onto Lava for support, ends up
      pulling him down, too. Slate gets to his knees and looks
      out the window... and his jaw drops in astonishment.
238   HIS POV - SLATE CITY                                       238

      In the distance, with a CRACKLING ROAR, the little rows
      of Fibrerock tract houses are falling like dominoes in
      a wave that is rolling toward the Slate Needle.
239   SLATE CITY DEVELOPMENT - NIGHT                             239

      A flashlight beam  rakes the CAMERA. Feldspar, shotgun
      in one hand, light  in the other, looks around cautiously.
      (The shotgun has a  slingshot mechanism; the flashlight
      is a mirror-backed  candle.)

      Behind him, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.   Feldspar tenses, but

      Fred hesitates... then, hearing a CREAK and GROAN, he
      looks at the HOUSE beside him. The stucco-like exterior
      of Fibrerock is beginning to crumble.

      Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact
      has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its

      which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred-
      ibly long neck. The bony plates on the creature's back
      make perfect stairs.

      However, the creature is noticeably listless and
      uncooperative.

                                 FIRE CHIEF
                   Come on, come on, what's the hold
                   up -- ?
                                 FIREFIGHTER
                   It's the kibble crisis, sir --
                   the firesauruses have been on
                   half-rations for a month!
      Above them, the BUILDING SHUDDERS again.

                                                             112.

257   IN THE SLATE NEEDLE                                        257
      Now, the remaining LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down. When they
      hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire
      spreads.
                               WILMA
                        (pointing)
                Fred!   There's a fire hose -- !

      Indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE
      HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS. Fred and Barney
      take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and
      cuts them off.
      Helpless, they step back.

      With a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible
      through what's left of the picture window COLLAPSE. Then
      the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to
      decompose. It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture
      in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well,
      life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose,
      CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here
      ... rolls up to Slate's feet.

      Pause. Everyone looks at everyone else. This is it:
      Titanic time. Fred embraces Wilma... Barney embraces
      Betty. Their kids are pulled into the clinch. Even
      Slate takes Mrs. Slate's hand. Talk about grace under
      pressure... and speaking of --
258   GRACE                                                         258
      -- the star fashion model, suddenly her Fibrethread
      costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little
      animal print undies.
259   BETTY                                                         259

      In the middle of going down with the ship, she turns
      Bam-Bam's face away from this display.

                              BAM-BAM
                D-dad, are we gonna be okay?
                              BARNEY
                       (pause; false smile)
                Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for
                the fire department. Right, Fred?
                              FRED
                Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be
                just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh --
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              113.

259   CONTINUED:                                                     259
      He's started yelping because he's realized his arm    is
      on fire, and now he jumps up and the others begin    beating
      at the arm with anything in their hands, and then    Fred
      suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with    a small
      flame flickering on his forearm like a Rock Vegas    stage
      magician.

                                 FRED
                   -- Wait a minute -- I don't feel
                   anything at all --

      With his other "claw" he slaps tentatively at the flames,
      and then confidentially snuffs it out.
                                 BARNEY
                   It must be the suit, Fred -- old
                   Bedrock High built them things to
                   last --
      Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the
      guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same
      idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth.
      All brighten.

      Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place.
                                  BARNEY
                          (rapping on the head)
                   -- Okay?
                                 FRED
                   Hist hust fine!
      He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks
      at him harmlessly. Then with his claw, he SMASHES the
      amber GLASS --

260   IN THE BOX                                                     260
      A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up inside,     SNORING. (Note
      to herpetologists: The pythonosaurus is      not quite a
      snake: it has little vestigial forepaws      the better to
      emote with. Right now the snoring head      is in those
      little paws.)

      The Pythonsaurus stirs, looks at Fred, "sniffs" the
      smoke. Then he raises one hand and finger as if to say
      "one moment." Then the pythonsaurus turns his head
      towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages, slurps
      loudly.

      We hear gallons and gallons of WATER GURGLING away...

                                                               114.

261   IN THE MAIN ROOM                                            261
      Everyone retreats from the fire. Slate picks up the head
      of the statue, his only souvenir.

262   WITH FRED                                                       262
      Waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally
      finishes drinking. It wipes its mouth daintily with a
      napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns
      and runs back into the other room. (Behind him, yards
      and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden compart-
      ment behind the box.) Water shoots out of the creature's
      mouth.
263   WIDER                                                           263

      Fred turns in a semi-circle and puts out every lick of
      flame in the room. All the guests cheer, rush forward
      and slap Fred on the back. Pebbles jumps up on him and
      kisses him.
                                FRED
                  Hit fuzz nudding... wheely...
      The pythonsaurus looks around at the attention.
                                PYTHONSAURUS
                  Hey, what am I, chopped liver?
                                BARNEY
                  Come on, everybody -- we'll go
                  out the way we came!
      Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying
      a route in the crumbling Fibrerock. Then Barney and
      Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent
      Fibresphere.

                                POINDEXTER
                         (pushing and shoving)
                  Outta the way -- outta the way --
                  women and children first -- ! I
                  mean, ah, children and women
                  first, yeah, yeah, provided that
                  uh, there's room for the women...

      Meanwhile, the pythonsaurus gives Fred (or rather his
      costume) a big look up and down, looks TOWARD the CAMERA.
                                  PYTHONSAURUS
                  Hey, not bad.    Wonder if she lives
                  around here.

      Just then Fred tilts back the monster head.        The
      pythonsaurus reacts.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            115.

                                   PYTHONSAURUS
                   Heartbreaker!

      Depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others. Fred and
      Barney cross over into the Fibresphere. As the do, Slate
      Needle completely collapses.

264   EXT. FIBRESPHERE - LONG SHOT                               264
      The Slate Needle tumbles down, taking a big chunk of the
      Fibresphere with it! But the rest of the huge globe
      stays put... for now.
265   RESCUE WORKERS BELOW                                       265

      Barney gives the dwindling circle of solid Fibre around
      the group another shot of coo-coo juice. Poindexter Lava
      pushes his way forward.

                   Yeah. Real chip off the old
                   block, ain't he?
      Embarrassed, Mrs. Slate grabs the kid by the neck,
      practically throws him at the cable. She follows him
      down, followed by Lava and Mr. Slate.
269   REAR OF FLEEING PEOPLE                                       269

      Fred and Barney have bravely held up the rear, their
      families clutching to them. Barney's carrying Bam-Bam.

      Their kids on their backs, Fred and Barney exchange a
      heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake...
      both put their hands on the cable... and then the whole
      pulley mechanism falls right down between them and

      Dust and smoke clear. When we can see again, well, it's
      not a pretty sight. The entire fibresphere is gone. All
      that's left, teetering on two spindly supports, are two
      tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of
      rubble too small for a human to negotiate... and all
      that's holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the

      MUSIC COMES UP DRAMATICALLY as he catches on! His eyes
      fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly
      bridge that leads to his master and friends.
282   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              282

      Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his
      steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island!
      Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids
      on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he
      "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to
      Barney -- and then --

283   LONG SHOT                                                    283
      -- Dino slides down the long wire, carrying everyone to
      safety! They all plow into the biggest rescue net as
      Wilma and Betty wind up!

                                WILMA AND BETTY
                  Yes, I don't need to shimmy,
                  I don't need to bop
                  'Cause I'm doin', doin', doin'
                  THE IGNEOUS ROCK!

                                                            119.

284   FRED                                                         284
      rolls out of the net and away from the others. He's
      slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up...
      suddenly lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up
      and sees --
285   HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS                       285

      All with weapons aimed right at him. Spotlights on the
      police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic
      mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys.

      Feldspar is at the head of the group. He cocks his
      shotgun. The elastic catapults at the hammers twitch
      menacingly --

                                FELDSPAR
                  It's the xenosaurus -- stand back,
                  men -- it's a vicious killer --
                  Ready -- Aim --
                                FRED
                         (with desperate poignancy)
                  High ham noght a zenosore! High
                  ham hay hooman beeng -- !
      BAM! WHAM! KABAM! Bullets and projectiles begin
      slamming all around Fred! He ducks behind a big fallen
      chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets
      and shells bounce off its resilient surface.
286   CLOSE - FRED                                                 286
      Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that
      stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it
      with his claws --
      -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him
      decomposes! He's back in the line of fire!
287   DINO                                                         287

      Flanked by Wilma, Barney and the kids, who are shouting
      for the police to stop, only Dino the wonder bronto has
      the wits to act!

      "YI-YI-YI-ING," he races forward, CAMERA FOLLOWING --
      and with lightning reflexes grabs the seat of Fred's
      monster suit and -- de-pants him!
      Instantly, Dino whirls Fred around, points to the now
      revealed striped undershorts.

288   WIDER                                                        288
      Pause.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              120.

288   CONTINUED:                                                     288
      Then Officer Gravel takes a good look at that rear end.

                                 GRAVEL
                   Hey, those are the biggest shorts
                   I've ever seen...
                          (realizing)
                   ... It... it must be Mister
                   Flintstone! Cease fire!
                          (to Feldspar)
                   Gee, Sarge, now you don't have
                   to shoot him -- !

      Now Fred confirms Gravel's hunch as the costume head
      finally pops off. All the cops lower their guns.
      (Strangely, though, Feldspar still continues to raise
      his gun -- even aims! Then an alarmed Gravel wrestles
      it away from his superior.)
289   THE FLINTSTONES AND RUBBLES - DAWN                           289
      Safe, they all emotionally embrace. Fred even suffers
      Dino's affection. (In the b.g., a police car holding
      Piltdown, Pyrite and Lava drives past. Poindexter Lava
      is chasing the car.)
                                 POINDEXTER
                          (distant)
                   Dad! Dad! Can I use the
                   Porscherock while you're in the
                   slammer?
      Suddenly the Slates push their way into the group hug.
                                 SLATE
                   Flintstone. Rubble. I... I
                   don't know what to say. I... I
                   treated you horribly... I ignored
                   you, abused you... and then you
                   come here and risk your necks like
                   this... well, there's no price you
                   can put on something like that,
                   so I won't even try. But let me
                   give you...
                          (with great
                           poignancy)
                   ... a hearty handshake.

                                 MRS. SLATE
                   Dear, don't you think a little
                   more than that is in order?

                                 SLATE
                   Honey, you're being hysterical,
                   go lie down, okay?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               121.

289   CONTINUED:                                                      289
                                 MRS. SLATE
                   I am not being hysterical, I am
                   being fair -- now the Flintsteins
                   and Rabbles saved all of our
                   lives, not to mention your
                   reputation.

                                 SLATE
                          (sighing)
                   Okay, okay.
                          (to Fred and Barney)
                   Boys, I'm feeling guilty about
                   how you've been taken advantage
                   of, so I'll tell you what... I'm
                   going to give you back all
                   world-wide rights to Fibrerock,
                   free and clear.
      He picks up a fragment of stone, begins writing on it.
                                 SLATE
                   Your only obligation will be to
                   cover oh, whatever legal expenses
                   might surface at some later time...
                                 BARNEY
                   You think there's gonna be some?
      Slate looks around at --
290   HIS POV - THE RUINS AND DESTRUCTION                           290
      Smoking desolation as far as the eye and CAMERA can see.
      As we watch the last remaining fragment of Slate City
      collapse, crushing a police car.

      Several sniff at the air, look curiously at a nearby
      pile of crumbled Fibrerock. One and then another
      shuffles over, tentatively tastes some... grins... and
      digs in! Seeing this, the "firesauruses" crane out
      their necks, also begin chowing down on the pile of
      Fibrerock crumbs.

293   FRED, BARNEY, SLATE AND OTHERS                                293
      All turn at the growing sound of the ANIMALS PIGGING OUT.

      Now DINO "YI-YI-YI'S" past this group and leaps into the
      pile, munching like crazy.

      Barney puts out his hand as chunks of Fibrerock shower
      down like rain from the feeding frenzy. Catching some
      pieces, he nibbles on it a little.

                                   FRED
                   Barn...?    What's going on?
                                 BARNEY
                          (sniffing it)
                   Lava Lava leaves... Woca sap...
                   all still there, but now the
                   nutrients are all released...
                          (realizing)
                   ... Fred, this... this is Dino

                                 FRED
                   Dino kibble...?
      Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching
      animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with
      the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth...
      chews. His eyes widen...
                                 FRED

      He spits it out, takes out the chunk of contract
      Slate wrote on.

                                 FRED
                   Barney, we -- we're rich!

      Faints dead away!       The CAMERA PULLS BACK... BACK...
      BACK --
295   EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT                           295

      We're back where we began. As "The End" appears on the
      drive-in screen, cars are streaming out of the drive-in
      theatre. The Flintstone car is among them.
296   EXT. DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                              296

      Fred and company roll into a '50's-style drive-in
      restaurant. A sign advertises BRONTO BURGERS AND RIBS.

      A pretty carhop on stone roller skates glides over.
      Fred holds up one finger towards her. She nods, scampers
      O.S. Fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici-
      pation... and then the girl returns with a massive rack
      of ribs on a car tray. She hooks it on the edge of
      the driver's door... and the entire car tips over with a
      crash.

                                                CUT TO:
297   EXT. FLINTSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT                              297

      WIDEN FROM the mailbox. Fred and family pull up. Dino
      runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already
      asleep on her shoulder. Fred follows, the saber-tooth
      cat on his heels. Fred stops in the doorway to put a
      milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down
      beside it. He shuts the door.
      Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window.
      Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then
      slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the
      door... it's locked!

                                 MUSIC (V.O.)

      CAMERA CRANES UP, WIDENS as Fred becomes a tiny sil-

"FORREST GUMP" -- by Eric Roth

 
                                      "FORREST GUMP"

                                      Screenplay by

                                        Eric Roth

                                   Based on a novel by

                                      Winston Groom

                

               EXT. A SAVANNAH STREET - DAY (1981)

               A feather floats through the air. The falling feather.

               A city, Savannah, is revealed in the background. The feather 
               floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down 
               toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive 
               by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder.

               He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked 
               back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car. 
               The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward 
               the street.

               The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying 
               back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather 
               floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's 
               mudsoaked shoe.

               The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is 
               FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a 
               box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case.

               Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a 
               pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items.

               Forrest pulls out a book titled "Curious George," then places 
               the feather inside the book. Forrest closes the suitcase.

               Something in his eyes reveals that Forrest may not be all 
               there.

               Forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard.

               A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus 
               continues on.

               A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at 
               the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a 
               magazine as Forrest looks at her.

                                     FORREST
                         Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.

               He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse.

                                     FORREST
                         You want a chocolate?

               The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this 
               strange man next to her.

                                     FORREST
                         I could eat about a million and a 
                         half of these. My momma always said, 
                         "Life was like a box of chocolates.
                         You never know what you're gonna 
                         get."

               Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's 
               shoes.

                                     FORREST
                         Those must be comfortable shoes. 
                         I'll bet you could walk all day in 
                         shoes like that and not feel a thing. 
                         I wish I had shoes like that.

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         My feet hurt.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma always says there's an awful 
                         lot you could tell about a person by 
                         their shoes. Where they're going.
                         Where they've been.

               The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his 
               own shoes.

                                     FORREST
                         I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I 
                         think about it real hard I could 
                         remember my first pair of shoes.

               Forrest closes his eyes tightly.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma said they'd take my anywhere.

               INT. COUNTRY DOCTOR'S OFFICE - GREENBOW, ALABAMA - DAY 
               (1951)

               A little boy closes his eyes tightly. It is young Forrest as 
               he sits in a doctor's office.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She said they was my magic shoes.

               Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg 
               braces.

                                     DOCTOR
                         All right, Forrest, you can open 
                         your eyes now. Let's take a little 
                         walk around.

               The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around 
               stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS. GUMP, watches him as he clanks 
               around the room awkwardly.

                                     DOCTOR
                         How do those feel? His legs are 
                         strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've 
                         ever seen. But his back is as crooked 
                         as a politician.

               Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump.

                                     DOCTOR
                         But we're gonna straighten him right 
                         up now, won't we, Forrest?

               A loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest!

               EXT. GREENBOW, ALABAMA

               Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street. Forrest 
               walks stiffly next to his mother.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, when I was a baby, Momma named 
                         me after the great Civil War hero, 
                         General Nathan Bedford Forrest...

               EXT. RURAL ALABAMA

               A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

               The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded 
               sheet over his head.

               The General is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse.

               The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan 
               members dressed in full uniform.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She said we was related to him in 
                         some way. And, what he did was, he 
                         started up this club called the Ku 
                         Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in 
                         their robes and their bedsheets and 
                         act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks 
                         or something. They'd even put 
                         bedsheets on their horses and ride 
                         around. And anyway, that's how I got 
                         my name. Forrest Gump.

               EXT. GREENBOW

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma said that the Forrest part was 
                         to remind me that sometimes we all 
                         do things that, well, just don't 
                         make no sense.

               Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. Forrest's 
               brace is caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and 
               tries to free Forrest. Two old cronies sit in front of a 
               barber shop and watch.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Just wait, let me get it.

               Mrs. Gump struggles to pull the stuck brace from the grate.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Let me get it. Wait, get it this 
                         way. Hold on.

               Forrest pulls his foot out of the grate.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         All right.

               Mrs. Gump helps Forrest up onto the sidewalk. She looks up 
               and notices the two old man.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Oooh. All right. What are you all 
                         staring at? Haven't you ever seen a 
                         little boy with braces on his legs 
                         before?

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two 
               old men. Mrs. Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Don't ever let anybody tell you 
                         they're better than you, Forrest. If 
                         God intended everybody to be the 
                         same, he'd have given us all braces 
                         on our legs.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma always had a way of explaining 
                         things so I could understand them.

               EXT. OAK ALLEY/THE GUMP BOARDING HOUSE

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a dirt road. A row of 
               mailboxes stands left.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We lived about a quarter mile of 
                         Route 17, about a half mile from the 
                         town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in 
                         the county of Greenbow. Our house 
                         had been in Momma's family since her 
                         grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come 
                         across the ocean about a thousand 
                         years ago. Something like that.

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the Gump Boarding House 
               driveway.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Since it was just me and Momma and 
                         we had all these empty rooms, Momma 
                         decided to let those rooms out. Mostly 
                         to people passing through. Like from, 
                         oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like 
                         that. That's how me and Mommy got 
                         money. Mommy was a real smart lady.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Remember what I told you, Forrest.
                         You're no different than anybody 
                         else is.

               Mrs. Gump heads Forrest to the porch. She bends down to look 
               Forrest in the eye.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Did you hear what I said, Forrest?
                         You're the same as everybody else. 
                         You are no different.

                         Your boy's... different, Mrs. Gump.
                         Now, his I.Q. is seventy-five.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Well, we're all different, Mr.
                         Hancock.

               The principal sighs, then stands up.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She wanted me to have the finest 
                         education, so she took me to the 
                         Greenbow County Central School. I 
                         met the principal and all.

               The principal stands in front of Mrs. Gump. Forrest, sitting 
               left, listens.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         I want to show you something, Mrs.
                         Gump. Now, this is normal.

               The principal holds up a chart with a designations according 
               to I.Q. and points to the center of the graph, labeled 
               "Normal." A red line below the normal area is labeled "State 
               Acceptance." The principal points to the section below the 
               acceptance line labeled "Below."

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Forrest is right here. The state 
                         requires a minimum I.Q. of eighty to 
                         attend public school, Mrs. Gump.
                         He's gonna have to go to a special 
                         school. Now, he'll be just fine.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         What does normal mean, anyway? He 
                         might be a bit on the slow side, but 
                         my boy Forrest is going to get the 
                         same opportunities as everyone else.
                         He's not going to some special school 
                         to learn to how to re-tread tires. 
                         We're talking about five little points 
                         here. There must be something can be 
                         done.

               Forrest sits outside the principal's office.

                         We're a progressive school system.
                         We don't want to see anybody left

                         Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         He's on vacation.

               EXT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest sits on a swing outside the house. Loud organic male 
               grunts are heard coming from inside the house. Forrest sits 
               on the swing as the grunts continue. The principal steps out 
               of the Gump House and wipes the sweat from his face.

               Forrest is sitting on the porch.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Well, your momma sure does care about 
                         your schooling, son. Mm-mm-mm.

               The principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back 
               at Forrest.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         You don't say much, do you?

               Forrest grunts, imitating him. The principal, embarrassed, 
               turns and walks away.

               INT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE/FORREST'S BEDROOM

               Mrs. Gump reads from the book "Curious George" as Forrest 
               sits on the bed and listens.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Finally, he had to try it. It looked 
                         easy, but, oh, what happened. First 
                         there...

                                     FORREST
                         Momma, what's vacation mean?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Vacation?

                                     FORREST
                         Where Daddy went?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Vacation's when you go somewhere, 
                         and you don't ever come back.

               Forrest lies down on his bed and looks up.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Anyway, I guess you could say me and 
                         Momma was on our own.

               A cab driver closes the trunk of the car as two women walk 
               toward the house. A milkman steps down from the porch.

                         But we didn't mind. Our house was 
                         never empty. There was always folks 
                         comin' and goin'.

                                     MRS. GUMP (V.O.)
                         Suppa.

               INT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE

               Mrs. Gump steps forward and speaks to all the boarders.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         It's suppa, everyone. Forrest...

               A MAN WITH A CANE steps left across the hall.

                                     MAN WITH CANE
                         My, my. That sure looks special.

               Mrs. Gump looks into a sitting room and informs the boarders 
               about dinner.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Gentlemen, would you care to join us 
                         for supper? Hurry up and get it before 
                         the flies do. I prefer you don't 
                         smoke that cigar so close to mealtime.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes we had so many people 
                         stayin' with us that every room was 
                         filled with travelers. You know, 
                         folks livin' out of their suitcases, 
                         and hat cases, and sample cases.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Well, you go ahead and start. I can't 
                         find Forrest.

               Mrs. Gump walks up the stairs.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest... Forrest...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         One time a young man was staying 
                         with us, and he had him a guitar 
                         case.

               Mrs. Gump looks into Forrest's room. She hears singing coming 
               from another room and walks over to a closed door. Mrs. Gump 
               opens the door, revealing a young man with long sideburns as 
               he plays the guitar and sings. Forrest holds onto a broom 
               and dances oddly. The young man is ELVIS PRESLEY.

                                     ELVIS PRESLEY
                              (sings)
                         "Well, you ain't never caught a 
                         rabbit, and you ain't no friend of 
                         mine."

               Forrest's legs rock back and forth to the guitar.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest! I told you not to bother 
                         this nice young man.

                                     ELVIS
                         Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I 
                         was just showin' him a thing or two 
                         on the guitar here.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         All right, but your supper's ready 
                         if y'all want to eat.

                                     ELVIS
                         Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, 
                         ma'am.

               Mrs. Gump leaves and closes the door. Elvis sits back down.

               Forrest stands left, and looks himself in a mirror.

                                     ELVIS
                         Say, man, show me that crazy little 
                         walk you just did there. Slow it 
                         down some.

               Forrest begins to dance again as Elvis plays the guitar and 
               sings.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "You ain't nothin' but a hound, hound 
                         dog..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I liked that guitar.

               Forrest dances as he watches himself in the mirror.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It sounded good.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "...cryin' all the time"

               Forrest rocks up and down on his braced legs, then begins to 
               step.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "You ain't nothin' but a hound dog..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I started moving around to the music, 
                         swinging my hips. This one night me 
                         and Momma...

               EXT. GREENBOW - NIGHT

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a sidewalk. A television 
               inside a store window reveals Elvis Presley as he performs 
               "Houng Dog" on a stage.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...was out shoppin', and we walked 
                         right by Benson's Furniture and 
                         Appliance store, and guess what.

               The television reveals Elvis as he thrusts his hips and sings.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest watch the television. Elvis dances 
               around in the same manner Forrest did. A woman in the audience 
               screaming and applauding.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         This is not children's eyes.

               Mrs. Gump walks away, pulling Forrest with her. Forrest stops 
               and takes one last look. Elvis continues to perform over the 
               television.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit 
                         and you ain't no friend of mine."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some years later, that handsome young 
                         man who they called "The King," well, 
                         he sung too many songs, had himself 
                         a heart attack or something.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY

               Forrest is still sitting on the bus bench. The black nurse 
               looks at him.

                                     FORREST
                         Must be hard being a king. You know, 
                         it's funny how you remember some 
                         things, but some things you can't.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/ALABAMA - MORNING (1954)

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest wait for the school bus. The bus pulls 
               up as Mrs. Gump prepares Forrest for his first day of school.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         You do your very best now, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         I sure will, Momma.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I remember the bus ride on the first 
                         day of school very well.

               The bus driver opens the door and looks down. Forrest walks 
               to the steps of the bus and looks at the bus driver. She is 
               smoking a cigarette.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         Are you comin' along?

                                     FORREST
                         Momma said not to be taking rides 
                         from strangers.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         This is the bus to school.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm Forrest Gump.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         I'm Dorothy Harris.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

               The bus driver smiles as Forrest steps up into the bus.

               INT. BUS

               Forrest steps up onto the bus. Mrs. Gump waves to Forrest as 
               the bus drives away. Forrest begins to walk down the aisle.

               TWO YOUNG BOYS look up from the seat.

                                     BOY #1
                         This seat's taken.

                                     BOY #2
                         It's taken!

               Forrest looks around. A larger girl slides over so Forrest 
               can't sit next to her. She shakes her head. Forrest looks to 
               the other side where a boy sits alone on a larger seat. They 
               boy glares up at Forrest.

                                     BOY #3
                         You can't sit here.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         You know, it's funny what a young 
                         man recollects. 'Cause I don't 
                         remember being born.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY

               Forrest continues talking as he sits on the bus bench.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I, I... don't recall what I got for 
                         my first Christmas and I don't know 
                         when I went on my first outdoor 
                         picnic. But, I do remember the first 
                         time I heard the sweetiest voice...

               INT. BUS - MORNING (1954)

               Young Forrest is still standing in the aisle on the bus.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...in the wide world.

                                     GIRL
                         You can sit here if you want.

               Forrest looks back at JENNY CURRAN, a young girl about 
               Forrest's age.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I had never seen anything so beautiful 
                         in my life. She was like an angel.

                                     JENNY
                         Well, are you gonna sit down, or 
                         aren't ya?

               Forrest sits down next to Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         What's wrong with your legs?

                                     FORREST
                         Um, nothing at all, thank you. My 
                         legs are just fine and dandy.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I just sat next to her on that bus 
                         and had conversation all the way to 
                         school.

                                     JENNY
                         Then why do you have those shoes on?

                                     FORREST
                         My momma said my back's crooked like 
                         a question mark. These are going to 
                         make me as straight as an arrow.
                         They're my magic shoes.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And next to Momma, no one ever talked 
                         to me or asked me questions.

                                     JENNY
                         Are you stupid or something.

                                     FORREST
                         Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.

               Jenny puts her hand out toward Forrest. Forrest reaches over 
               and shakes her hand.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm Jenny.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         From that day on, we was always 
                         together. Jenny and me was like peas 
                         and carrots.

               EXT. OAK TREE - DAY

               Young Jenny and Forrest run toward a large oak tree.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She taught me how to climb...

               Jenny sits on a large branch and calls down to Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

               Forrest dangles from the branch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...I showed her how to dangle.

               Jenny and Forrest sit on a tree branch and read.

                                     FORREST
                         "...a good little monkey and..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She helped me to learn how to read.

               Forrest hangs upside down from a branch and swings back and 
               forth. Forrest's braces are wedged in the tree.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And I showed her to swing.

               EXT. OAK TREE - NIGHT

               The silhouete of the oak tree, Jenny and Forrest as they sit 
               on a branch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait 
                         for the stars.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma's gonna worry about me.

               Jenny puts her hand on Forrest's hand.

                                     JENNY
                         Just stay a little longer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         For some reason, Jenny didn't never 
                         want to go home.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay, Jenny. I'll stay.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She was my most special friend.

               INT. SAVANNAH/BUS STOP - DAY

               Forrest nods as he remembers.

                                     FORREST
                         My only friend.

               Forrest continues talking to the black woman. She doesn't 
               seem to be listening as she reads her magazine. She looks up 
               from her magazine.

                                     FORREST
                         Now, my Momma always told me that 
                         miracles happen every day. Some people 
                         don't think so, but they do.

               EXT. OAK ALLEY - ANOTHER DAY (1954)

               Jenny and Forrest walk. A dirt clod hits Forrest in the back 
               of the head. Jenny looks as Forrest rubs his head. THREE 
               YOUNG BOYS get off their bikes and pick up more rocks.

                                     BOY #1
                         Hey... dummy!

               Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod. Forrest 
               falls backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him.

                                     BOY #2
                         Are you retarded, or just plain 
                         stupid?

                                     BOY #3
                         Look, I'm Forrest Gump.

               Jenny helps Forrest back up. Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more 
               dirt clods at Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Just run away, Forrest.

               Another dirt clod hits Forrest in the arm.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest tries to run along the road, but his braces makes it 
               impossible. He hobbles along as Jenny yells after him.

                                     JENNY
                         Run away! Hurry!

               Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes.

                                     BOY #2
                         Get the bikes!

                                     BOY #3
                         Hurry up!

               The boys pick up their bikes and ride after Forrest.

                                     BOY #3
                         Let's get him! Come on!

                                     BOY #2
                         Look out, dummy, here we come!

               The boys ride after Forrest. Jenny stands and watches.

                                     BOY #2
                         We're gonna get you!

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest! Run!

               Forrest hobbles along the dirt road.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest looks over his shoulder. The three boys race on their 
               bikes.

                                     BOY #1
                         Come back here, you!

               Forrest begins to run faster with his braces on. Forrest 
               continues running as the boys chase him. Blood drips down 
               from a cut on his head. The boys on the bikes are gaining on 
               Forrest. Forrest hobbles along. He begins to gain speed.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest! Run!

               SLOW MOTION --

               Forrest runs from the chasing room. He looks over his shoulder 
               in fear.

               The boys on the bikes peddle faster as they gain on Forrest, 
               running.

               Forrest tries to run even faster to get away. Suddenly his 
               braces shatter, sending steel and plastic flying into the 
               air.

               Forrest runs and look down at his legs in surprise.

               Forrest continues to run faster as the metal braces and straps 
               fly off his legs.

               Forrest runs free of his braces and begins to pick up speed.

               The chasing boys ride over the remains of Forrest's braces.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, you wouldn't believe it if I 
                         told you.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/ BUS BENCH - DAY

                                     FORREST
                         But I can run like the wind blows.

               The black woman continues to read her magazine. Forrest smiles 
               as he remembers.

                                     FORREST
                         From that day on, if I was going 
                         somewhere, I was running!

               EXT. OAK ALLEY - DAY (1954)

               Forrest sprints away from the boys. The boys stop the chase 
               and watch in disbelief. Forrest is already at the far end of 
               the road, clear of the chasing boys.

                                     BOY #2
                         He's gettin' away! Stop him!

               Boy #1 throws his bike down in frustration. Forrest runs 
               across a field.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD

               Forrest runs past a chain gang in their prison uniforms.

               They are cutting at the weeds on the side of the road.

               EXT. GREENBOW

               Forrest runs across the street. THE TWO OLD MEN sit in front 
               of the barber shop.

                                     OLD CRONY
                         That boy sure is a running fool.

               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE

               Forrest runs down a driveway toward Jenny's small house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now remember how I told you that 
                         Jenny never seemed to want to go 
                         home? Well, she lived in a house 
                         that was as old as Alabama. Her Momma 
                         had gone up to heaven when she was 
                         five and her daddy was some kind of 
                         a farmer.

               Forrest knocks on Jenny's door.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny? Jenny?

               Forrest look around the field at the left. He notices Jenny 
               and runs toward her.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He was a very lovin' man. He was 
                         always kissing and touchin' her and 
                         her sisters. And then this one time, 
                         Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to 
                         school.

               Forrest runs to Jenny.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny, why didn't you come to school 
                         today?

                                     JENNY
                         Hsh! Daddy's takin' a nap.

               Jenny grabs Forrest's hand and runs into the field. Jenny's 
               DAD drunk, steps out onto the porch and shouts.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny!

                                     JENNY
                         Come on!

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd 
                         better come back here, girl!

               Jenny's dad steps out toward the field. Jenny leads Forrest 
               into the thick tobacco field. Jenny's dad runs through the 
               field searching for Jenny with a liquor bottle in his hand.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Where you at?

               Jenny and Forrest run into a corn field as Jenny's dad tries 
               to chase her.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny!

               Jenny drops to her knees and pulls Forrest down with her.

                                     JENNY
                         Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny!

                                     JENNY
                         Dear God, make me a bird so I can 
                         fly far, far, far away from here.
                         Dear God, make me a bird so I can 
                         fly far, far, far away from here.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma always said that God is 
                         mysterious.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny! Get back here!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He didn't turn Jenny into a bird 
                         that day. Instead...

               EXT. TRAILER PARK/ALABAMA - DAY (1955)

               A police officer escorts Jenny to her grandmother's trailer.

               Jenny's grandmother meets Jenny outside and leads her toward 
               the trailer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...he had the police say Jenny didn't 
                         have to stay in that house no more.
                         She went to live with her grandma 
                         just over on Creekmore Avenue, which 
                         made me happy 'cause she was so close.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT (1955)

               Jenny climbs over a second-floor railing and enters the house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out and 
                         come over to my house, just 'cause 
                         she said she was scared. Scared of 
                         what, I don't know...

               INT. GUMP HOUSE/FORREST'S BEDROOM

               Jenny lies in bed next to young Forrest. She hugs him.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...but I think it was her grandma's 
                         dog. He was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny 
                         and me was best friends...

               EXT. GREENBOW/OAK ALLEY - DAY (1961)

               Forrest and Jenny are teenagers now. They walk along an 
               oaklined road.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...all the way to high school.

               Suddenly Forrest is hit in the back with a rock. Forrest and 
               Jenny turn around.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Hey, stupid!

                                     JENNY
                         Quit it!

               A teenage boy throws another rock as a pickup truck pulls up 
               behind him. Jenny turns and looks at Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest, run!

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Hey. Did you hear me, stupid?

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest drops his books and runs down the road. The teenage 
               boy jumps into the back of the pickup truck with another boy 
               as the truck speeds after Forrest. Jenny steps left and gets 
               out of the way.

                                     OLDER BOY #2
                         Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest! Run!

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         You better be runnin', stupid.

               Forrest runs along the road. The truck speeds after him.

                                     OLDER BOY #2
                         Come on, dummy!

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Haul ass, dummy!

               Older Boy throws rocks at Forrest.

                                     OLDER BOY #1

                         Ya-hoo!

               EXT. OAK ALLEY

               The boys in the back of the truck throw rocks at Forrest as 
               they drive up to him.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Move it, jack rabbit!

               The truck follows right on Forrest's heels. A rebel flag 
               license plate adorns the truck's grill.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Come on!

               Forrest runs along the road as the truck chases him. The 
               boys in the back of the truck pound on the roof as the truck 
               turns right, after Forrest. The truck drives into a field.

               Forrest runs toward a fence.

                                     BOY
                         Run! Faster! Yeah! Go! Go! Come on, 
                         Forrest! Yeah!

                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest leaps over a five-foot fence as the boys try to catch 
               him.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY (1981)

               Forrest looks left as he continues telling his life story.

                                     FORREST
                         Now, it used to be, I ran to get 
                         where I was goin'. I never thought 
                         it would take me anywhere.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/ROAD - DAY (1961)

               Forrest runs along the road in front of the high school. The 
               truck continues to chase him as the boys pound on the roof.

                                     OLDER BOY
                         Come on. Whoo-hoo!

               The truck speeds past Forrest as he turns from the road and 
               runs onto the high school football field. Forrest runs across 
               the field during a football scrimmage.

               In the stands watching the scrimmage is the legendary 
               University of Alabama football coach BEAR BRYANT, wearing 
               his trademark plaid hat.

               A group of assistant coaches sit around him, as well as the 
               high school football coach. The quarterback throws the ball 
               into the air.

               Forrest runs past the quarterback. The receiver catches the 
               ball. Forrest runs past the receiver as an opposing player 
               tackles the stunned receiver.

               The football coach stands, followed by the assistant coaches.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Who in the hell is that?

                         That there is Forrest Gump. Coach.
                         Just a local idiot.

               Forrest runs under the field goal post and through the end 
               zone.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And can you believe it? I got to go 
                         to college, too.

               EXT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA STADIUM - DAY (1962)

               The crowd roars with excitement as a football is kicked off.

               The football players run around on the field. The crowd of 
               cheering fans create a huge sign that reads: "GO."

               Forrest is in a University of Alabama football uniform. He 
               looks up into the cheering crowd as his teammate fields the 
               kickoff. The teammate runs over to Forrest and hands him the 
               ball.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Okay! Run!

               The football coach, the assistants, and Alabama players cheer 
               for Forrest.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Run, you stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run!

               Forrest runs across the field. He speeds past the defending 
               players. Forrest runs past the opposite players. The crowd 
               cheers wildly, holding up cards, making a large sign that 
               reads: "Go."

               They turn the cards over, creating the word: "ALABAMA." The 
               football coach runs along the sidelines as he yells.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         You stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run! Go!
                         Run!

               Forrest cuts and runs toward the sidelines. Two opposing 
               players collide. The football coach, the assistants and the 
               players all motion for Forrest to run toward the end zone.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Run! Turn! Go!

               Forrest turns up the sidelines and runs toward the end zone.

               Some opposing players fall down. Forrest runs along the 
               sidelines. The opposing players try to catch him.

               Forrest runs into the end zone as an opposing player dives 
               at his feet. The referee holds up his arm, signaling a touch 
               down. The crowd cheers wildly.

               Forrest continues to run, smashing through the band members, 
               then all the way toward the team tunnel. The football coach 
               looks at an assistant coach.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         He must be the stupidest son-of-a-
                         bitch alive. But he sure is fast!

                         Now, maybe it was just me but college 
                         was very confusing times.

               Forrest stands next to George Wallace and listens.

                         We must have no violence today, or 
                         any other day, because these National 
                         Guardsmen are here today as Federal 
                         Soldiers for Alabamans. And they 
                         live within our borders and they are 
                         all our brothers. We are winning in 
                         this fight because we are awakening

                         trend toward military dictatorship 
                         in this country.

               EXT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA

               Some of the Alabama policeman and citizens clap their hands 
               as the National Guardsmen stand at attention with their 
               weapons in front of them. Forrest walks through the crowd.

               Two black students were being led toward the schoolhouse.

                         of Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been 
                         desegregated and students Jimmy Hood 
                         and Vivian Malone had been signed up 
                         for summer classes.

               The young black girl drops one of her books. Forrest notices 
               and steps past the policeman toward the book on the ground.

               Forrest steps out from the crowd and picks up the book. He 
               brings it up to the girl.

                                     FORREST

               A coach looks at the television. The television reveals

                         campus, he kept the mob from gathering 
                         and prevented violence.

               An assistant coach looks at the television, then at the other

               Forrest steps up to the coaches' area and grabs a clean towel.

               The coaches turn and stare at Forrest. Forrest gives them 
               one of his silly waves, then walks away.

                         It was nice talkin' to you.

               The white woman sits closer to Forrest.

                                     WHITE WOMAN
                         I remember when that happened, when 
                         Wallace got shot. I was in college.

                                     FORREST
                         Did you go to a girls' college, or 
                         to a girls' and boys' together 
                         college?

                                     WHITE WOMAN
                         It was co-ed.

                                     FORREST
                         'Cause Jenny went to a college I 
                         couldn't go to. It was a college 
                         just for girls.

               EXT, GIRLS' COLLEGE/JENNY'S DORM - NIGHT (1963)

               Forrest sits outside Jenny's dorm in the rain.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But, I'd go and visit her every chance 
                         I got.

               A car pulls up. A song is heard from the radio. Forrest, 
               holding a box of chocolates, looks at the car. The two people 
               inside the car begins to kiss and embrace each other. Jenny 
               is inside the car with a boy. She leans back against the 
               passenger side door as they struggle to get comfortable.

                                     JENNY
                         Ouch! That hurts.

               Forrest gets up and runs toward the car. He tries to look in 
               the window as he steps over to the driver's side door. He 
               opens the door and begins to punch the boy inside. Jenny 
               jump out of the car and runs over to Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest! Forrest! Forrest, stop it!
                         Stop it!

                                     BILLY
                         Jesus!

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing?

                                     FORREST
                         He was hurtin' you.

               Jenny's date, named BILLY, gets out of the car angrily.

                                     BILLY
                         What the hell is going on here?

                                     JENNY
                         No, he's not!

                                     BILLY
                         Who is that? Who is that?

                                     JENNY
                         Get over there!

               Jenny turns and looks at Billy. He shoves Jenny's hands away 
               from him.

                                     JENNY
                         Billy, I'm sorry.

                                     BILLY
                         What in the hell, git, would you git 
                         away from me!

                                     JENNY
                         Don't... Wait a second!

                                     BILLY
                         Git, just git away from me!

                                     JENNY
                         Don't go! Billy, wait a second!

               Billy gets back into the car.

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't know any better!

               Billy pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, why'd you do that?

               Forrest holds out the box of chocolates.

                                     FORREST
                         I brought you some chocolates. I'm 
                         sorry. I'll go back to my college 
                         now.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come 
                         on.

               Jenny grabs Forrest hand and leads him toward the dorm.

               INT. JENNY'S DORM/HALLWAY

               Jenny and Forrest sneak to Jenny's door.

                                     FORREST
                         Is this your room?

                                     JENNY
                         Shh!

               Jenny unlocks the door and they step inside.

               INT. JENNY'S DORM ROOM

               Jenny pulls a robe off of her sleeping roommate's bed. Jenny 
               hands the robe to Forrest, sitting on Jenny's bed.

                                     JENNY
                         Do you ever dream, Forrest, about 
                         who you're gonna be?

                                     FORREST
                         Who I'm gonna be?

                                     JENNY
                         Yeah.

                                     FORREST
                         Aren't I going to be me?

                                     JENNY
                         Well, you'll always be you, just 
                         another kind of you. You know? I 
                         want to be famous.

               Jenny picks up a towel, then walks back toward Forrest. Jenny 
               dries the water from her hair.

                                     JENNY
                         I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.
                         I just want to be an empty stage 
                         with my guitar, my voice... just me.

               Jenny takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to him.

               She is only wearing her bra and panties. Forrest looks at 
               Jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before.

                                     JENNY
                         And I want to reach people on a 
                         personal level. I want to be able to 
                         say things, just one-to-one.

               Forrest looks down at Jenny's breasts. Jenny realizes that 
               he is looking at her.

                                     JENNY
                         Have you ever been with a girl, 
                         Forrest?

                                     FORREST
                         I sit next to them in my home 
                         economics class all the time.

                         Northern Alabama. I'm Joel Dorn...

               Forrest looks at Jenny as she removes her bra. Forrest looks 
               away, a bit shamed. Jenny takes his hand and guides it up to 
               her breast.

                                     DJ

                         long so stay with us, get warm, get

                         cool sounds of WHHY.

               Forrest looks over at Jenny's breasts, the shudder as he has 
               an orgasm.

                                     FORREST
                         Ohh... Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.

                                     JENNY
                         It's okay.

               Forrest breathes heavily. Jenny puts her bra back on.

                                     JENNY
                         It's all right.

               Jenny leans over and puts her head on Forrest's shoulder.

                         Oh, I'm dizzy.

               A song is coming over the radio. Jenny hugs Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         I bet that never happened in home

                         No.

               Jenny laughs and kisses Forrest on the cheek. Forrest and 
               Jenny hug on the bed as Jenny's roommate pretends to be 
               asleep, but is listening, horrified, with her eyes open.

                                     FORREST

                         I don't care. I don't like her,

               Forrest runs across the field as the defending team chases 
               him. The crowd yells for Forrest. They flip a sign that reads: 
               "Go Forrest."

               Forrest runs into the end zone. The band members rush toward 
               Forrest with their hands up, signaling him to stop. The crowd 
               flips over cards, creating a sign that reads "STOP."

                         Stop!

               Forrest stops in the end zone as he hears the crowd yells.

               The band motions for Forrest to stop and stay in the end

               zone. A group of defending players fall over each other in 
               the end zone. Forrest looks as the crowd cheers wildly.

               The All-American players mingle around the food table. Forrest 
               steps up to the table. A large spread of food and soda is on 
               the table.

                         is the food.

               Forrest takes a bottle of Dr. Pepper from the buffet table.

               Numerous bottle of Dr. Pepper are displayed on the table. A 
               servant opens the bottle for him.

                         one, I wasn't hungry, but thirsty...

               Forrest begins to guzzle the Dr. Pepper.

                         musta drank me about fifteen Dr.

               Forrest sets down an empty Dr. Pepper bottle next to a large 
               number of other empty bottles. Forrest holds his stomach and 
               burps.

               BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE - President Kennedy shakes hands 
               with the All-American football players.

                                     PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                         Congratulations. How does it feel to 
                         be an All-American?

                                     1ST PLAYER
                         It's an honor, Sir.

               Another player steps up to the President and shakes the 
               President's hand.

                                     PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                         Congratulations. How does it feel to 
                         be an All-American?

                                     2ND PLAYER
                         Very good, Sir.

                                     PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                         Congratulations. How does it feel to 
                         be an All-American?

                                     3RD PLAYER
                         Very good, Sir.

               The player walks away. Forrest steps up to the President.

               The President shakes his hand.

                                     PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                         Congratulations. How do you feel?

                                     FORREST
                         I gotta pee.

               President Kennedy turns and smiles.

                                     PRESIDENT KENNEDY
                         I believe he said he had to go pee.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE/BATHROOM

               Forrest urinates in the bathroom, then lowers the lid and 
               flashes. Forrest washes his hands, then notices an autographed 
               photo from Marilyn Monroe and a photo of John with his brother 
               Bobby.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometime later, for no particular 
                         reason, somebody shot that nice young 
                         President when he was ridin' in his 
                         car.

               ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - DAY SLOW MOTION - President Kennedy rises 
               in a convertible and smiles.

                         And a few years after that...

               ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - Robert Kennedy stands at a podium as people 
               around him applaud.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...somebody shot his little brother, 
                         too, only he was in a hotel kitchen.

               EXT. SAVANNHA/BUS BENCH - DAY (1981)

               Forrest sits on the bench and shakes his head.

                                     FORREST
                         It must be hard being brothers. I 
                         wouldn't know.

               EXT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA - DAY - GRADUATION DAY (1966)

               Students in their caps and gowns step forward the podium to 
               receive their diplomas. Forrest's name is called. He steps 
               up and accepts his diploma.

                                     DEAN
                         Forrest Gump.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now can you believe it? After only 
                         five years of playing football, I 
                         got a college degree.

               The dean shakes Forrest's hand vigorously. Forrest looks out 
               into the crowd.

                                     DEAN
                         Congratulations, son.

               Mrs. Gump, sitting in the audience, cries.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma was proud.

               Forrest and Mrs. Gump have their picure taken in front of a 
               large statue. A military recruiter spots Forrest and steps 
               up to him.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest, I'm so proud of you. Here, 
                         I'll hold this for you.

               Mrs. Gump takes the diploma from Forrest. The recruiter slaps 
               Forrest on the shoulder and hands him some military 
               literature.

                                     MILITARY RECRUITER
                         Congratulations, son. Have you given 
                         any thought to your future?

                                     FORREST
                         Thought?

               Forrest looks at a pamphlet with a photo of "Uncle Sam" and 
               the caption "EXCELLENT CAREERS FOR EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN. Apply 
               now at your local U.S. Army Recruiting Center."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Hello, I'm Forrest...

               INT. ARMY BUS - DAY (1966)

               Forrest steps onto the army bus. Rain pours outside as the 
               army bus driver yells at Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         ...Forrest Gump.

                                     ARMY BUS DRIVER
                         Nobody gives a hunk of shit who you 
                         are, fuzzball! You're not even a 
                         lowlife scum sucking maggot! Get 
                         your faggoty ass on the bus. You're 
                         in the Army now!

               Forrest is about to sit on the first available seat, but the 
               recruit sitting there refuses Forrest.

                                     RECRUIT #1
                         This seat's taken.

               Forrest tries to sit on the next seat, but the 2nd recruit 
               slides over, blocking him.

                                     RECRUIT #2
                         It's taken.

               Forrest steps forward, looking much like he did on his first 
               bus ride to school years ago.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         At first, it seemed like I made a 
                         mistake.

               A large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much 
               like Forrest's, looks up from his seat. His name is BUBBA.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...seeing how it was my induction 
                         day and I was already gettin' yelled 
                         at.

               Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit 
               down.

                                     BUBBA
                         You can sit down... if you want to.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I didn't know who I might meet or 
                         what they might ask.

               Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief.

                                     BUBBA
                         You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

                                     FORREST
                         No, but I been on a real big boat.

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm talkin' about a shrimp catchin' 
                         boat. I've been workin' on shrimp 
                         boats all my life. I started out my 
                         uncle's boat, that's my mother's 
                         brother, when I was about maybe nine.
                         I was just lookin' into buyin' a 
                         boat of my own and got drafted. My 
                         given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.

               Bubba and Forrest shake hands.

                                     BUBBA
                         People call me Bubba. Just like one 
                         of them redneck boys. Can you believe 
                         that?

                                     FORREST
                         My name's Forrest Gump. People call

                         So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, 
                         Alabama, and his momma cooked shrimp.

               INT. LOUISIANA/KITCHEN - DAY (1966)

               Bubba's mother, a robust woman in a cook's uniform, carries 
               a bowl of shrimp into a dining room. She sets it down on a 
               table in front of a wealthy white man.

               INT. SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTH/KITCHEN - DAY (EARLY DAYS OF

               Bubba's grandmother carries a bowl of shrimp into a dining 
               room. She sets it down on a table in front of a wealthy white 
               man.

                         Okay.

               INT. BARRACKS - DAY

               A DRILL SERGEANT is in Forrest's face as Forrest stands in 
               line with the other recruits.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Gump! What's your sole purpose in

                         To do whatever you tell me, Drill

                         Private Gump!

               The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Listen up, people...

                         Now, for some reason, I fit in the 
                         Army like one of them round pegs.
                         It's not really hard. You just make

                         That is one very intelligent 
                         individual! You lock your scuzzy 
                         bodies up behind that private and do 
                         exactly what he does and you will go

                         Is that clear?

                         Yes, Drill Sergeant!

               ANOTHER DAY

               The recruits are sitting at the base of their bunks assembling 
               their rifles. Bubba speaks to Forrest.

                                     BUBBA
                         What you do is you just drag your 
                         nets across the bottom. On a good 
                         day, you can catch over a hundred 
                         pounds of shrimp. If everything goes 
                         all right, two men shrimpin' ten 
                         hours, less what you spends on gas, 
                         you can...

               Forrest finishes assembling his rifle as the other recruits 
               are still working on theirs.

                                     FORREST
                         Done, Drill Sergeant!

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Gump!

               The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Why did you put that weapon together 
                         so quickly, Gump?

                                     FORREST
                         You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

               The Drill Sergeant looks at his stop watch.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Jesus Christ! This is a new company

                         such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd 
                         recommended you for O.C.S., Private 
                         Gump. You are gonna be a General 
                         some day, Gump! Now, disassemble 
                         your weapon and continue!

               The Drill Sergeant walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble 
               his rifle. After the Drill Sergeant walks past Bubba, Bubba 
               looks up at Forrest. Bubba continues talking about shrimp in 
               his slow southern drawl.

                         Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is 
                         the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue 
                         it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute 
                         it. There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp 
                         creole...

               ANOTHER DAY

               Bubba and Forrest shine their boots.

                                     BUBBA
                         ...shrimp gumbo, panfried, deep fried, 
                         stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp, 
                         lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper 
                         shrimp...

               ANOTHER DAY

               Bubba and Forrest are on their hands and knees as they scrub 
               the floor with toothbrushes.

                                     BUBBA
                         ...shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp 
                         salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp 
                         burger, shrimp sandwich... that's, 
                         that's about it.

               NIGHT

               Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Nighttime in the Army is a lovely 
                         time.

               Forrest lies in his bunk and looks up.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We'd lay there in our bunks, and I'd 
                         miss my momma. And I'd miss Jenny.

               A young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest.

                                     YOUNG PRIVATE
                         Hey, Gump. Get a load of the tits on 
                         her!

               Forrest pick up the magazine and turns the page, revealing 
               Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all.

               The pictorial is titled: "Girls of the South." Forrest looks 
               up with shock. He cranes his head up for a closer look.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Turns out, Jenny had gotten into 
                         some trouble over... some photos of 
                         her in her college sweater. And she 
                         was thrown out of school.

                                     SONG
                         "My baby does the hanky-panky..."

               INT. NASHVILLE/NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT (1966)

               Forrest, in his army uniform, steps into the foyer of the 
               club.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But that wasn't a bad thing. Because 
                         a man who owns a theater in Memphis, 
                         Tennessee, saw those photo and offered 
                         Jenny a job singing in a show. The 
                         first chance I got, I took the bus 
                         up to Memphis to see her perform in 
                         that show.

               EMCEE steps out onto the stage.

                                     EMCEE
                         That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give 
                         her a big hand, guys. Good job, Amber.
                         And now, for your listening and 
                         viewing pleasure, direct from 
                         Hollywood, California, our very own 
                         beatnik beauty, let's give a big 
                         round of applause to the luscious 
                         Bobbie Dylan.

                                     CROWD
                         Bobbie... Bobbie...

               The emcee walks back off the stage and the curtain opens, 
               revealing Jenny as she sits on a stool on the stage. She 
               holds a guitar up and begins to play. She is topless.

                                     JENNY
                              (sings)
                         "Yes, and how many seas must the 
                         white dove said, before she sleeps 
                         in the sand."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Her dream had come true. She was a 
                         folk singer.

                                     JENNY
                              (sings)
                         "Yes, how many times must the 
                         cannonballs fly before they're forever

                         You gotta lose the guitar, darling.

                                     MAN #2
                         Hey, come on, baby. Shake it up.
                         Shake it up now.

                                     MAN #3
                         Hey, somebody ought to get her a 
                         harmonica.

               The men laugh.

                                     JENNY
                              (sings)

                         the wind. The answer is blowing in...

                         Yeah! Come on!

               Man #5 reaches up and tries to stick some money in Jenny's 
               shoe.

                                     MAN #5 :
                         Hey, honey, I got something here for 
                         you.

               Jenny kicks his hand. He yells angrily as he sits back down, 
               then tosses his drink on her.

                                     MAN #5
                         Goddamnit!

                                     JENNY
                         Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I'm singing a 
                         song here. Polly, get out here!

                                     MAN #
                         Hey, show us some stuff, honey!

                                     JENNY
                         Shut up! Oh, shut up!

               Forrest walks up to Man #5 and grabs him and tosses him down 
               on the ground. Man #4 tries to grab Forrest, but Forrest 
               shoves him down too.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, what are you doing here? 
                         What are you doing?

               Forrest climbs up onto the stage and picks Jenny up, guitar 
               and all, and carries her.

                                     FORREST
                         Come on.

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing? Forrest, let me 
                         down!

               Jenny struggles and frees herself from Forrest. Forrest steps 
               back in surprise. Jenny shoves the guitar at Forrest. Jenny 
               walks off as Forrest holds the guitar. He follows after her.

               EXT. MEMPHIS BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Forrest follows Jenny over a bridge outside the night club.

                                     JENNY
                         You can't keep doing this, Forrest.
                         You can't keep tryin' to rescue me 
                         all the time.

                                     FORREST
                         They was tryin' to grab you.

                                     JENNY
                         A lot of people try to grab me. Just --
                         you can't keep doing this all the 
                         time!

                                     FORREST
                         I can't help it. I love you.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, you don't know what love 
                         is.

               Jenny turns and looks over the bridge.

                                     JENNY
                         You remember that time we prayed, 
                         Forrest? We prayed for God to turn 
                         me into a bird so I could fly far, 
                         far away?

                                     FORREST
                         Yes, I do.

                                     JENNY
                         You think I can fly off this bridge?

                                     FORREST
                         What do you mean, Jenny?

                                     JENNY
                         Nothing.

               Jenny turns and looks at the light of an approaching vehicle.

               She steps into the street.

                                     JENNY
                         I gotta get outta here.

               Jenny runs and flags down the approaching vehicle.

                                     FORREST
                         But wait. Jenny!

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
                         You just stay away from me, please.

               A pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver.

                                     JENNY
                         Can I have a ride?

                                     DRIVER
                         Where you going?

                                     JENNY
                         I don't care.

                                     DRIVER
                         Get in the truck.

                                     FORREST
                         So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin' me 
                         to Vietnam. It's this whole other 
                         country.

               Jenny walks toward Forrest. She looks at the driver.

                                     JENNY
                         Just hang on a minute.

               Jenny walks up to Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Listen, you promise me something, 
                         okay? Just if you're ever in trouble, 
                         don't try to be brave, you just run, 
                         okay? Just run away.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the 
                         time.

               Jenny takes a last look at Forrest, then climbs into the 
               truck. Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And just like that.

               EXT. GREENBOW/GUMP BOARDING HOUSE/RIVER - DAY

               Forrest, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out 
               at a river.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...she was gone.

               Mrs. Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on 
               the log. Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's 
               shoulder.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         You come back safe to me, do ya hear?

               EXT. VIETNAM/MEKONG DELTA - MORNING (1967)

               The shadow of a helicopter over the rice field below. A 
               soldier is manning a gun from inside the helicopter. The 
               solider looks left, Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter.

               EXT. FIREBASE/4TH PLATOON

               The helicopter circles overhead, then lands at the firebase.

                         "Some folks are born made to wave 
                         the flag. Ooh, they're red, white 
                         and blue. And when the band plays 
                         "Hail to the Chief," ohh, they point 
                         the cannon at you all. It ain't me.
                         It ain't me. I ain't no Senator's 
                         son, no. It ain't me. It ain't me..."

               Bubba and Forrest jump out of the helicopter with their gear/ 
               They walk and look around oddly.

                         Now, they told us that Vietnam was 
                         gonna be very different from the 
                         United Sates of America.

               The soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases.

               He takes two beers out and walks away. In the background, 
               soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer.

                         Except for all the beer cans and the 
                         barbecue, it was.

                         Y'know, I bet there's shrimp all in 
                         these waters. They tell me these 
                         Vietnams is good shrimp. You know, 
                         after we win this war, and we take 
                         over everything we can get American 
                         shrimpers to come on here and shrimp 
                         these waters. We'll just shrimp all 
                         the time, man. So much shrimp, why, 
                         you wouldn't believe it.

               Lieutenant DAN TAYLOR steps out of a tent. Shirtless, he 
               holds a roll of toilet paper in his hand.

                         You must be my F.N.G.'s.

                         Morning', sir!

                                     LT. DAN
                         Ho! Get your hands down. Do not salute 
                         me. There are goddamned snipers all 
                         around this area who would love to 
                         grease an officer. I'm Lieutenant 
                         Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

               Lt. Dan looks at Bubba.

                                     LT. DAN
                         What's wrong with your lips?

                                     BUBBA
                         I was born with big gums, sir.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
                         Gonna get that caught on a trip wire. 
                         Where you boys from in the world?

                                     BUBBA & FORREST
                         Alabama, sir!

                                     LT. DAN
                         You twins?

               Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, they don't get 
               the joke.

                                     FORREST
                         No, we are not relations, sir.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Look, it's pretty basic here.

               Lt. Dan starts to walk. Bubba and Forrest grab their gear 
               and follow him.

                                     LT. DAN
                         You stick with me, you learn from 
                         the guys who been in country awhile, 
                         you'll be right. There is one item 
                         of G.I. gear that can be the 
                         difference between a live grunt and 
                         a dead grunt.

               Lt. Dan stops and looks at the boys.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Socks, cushion, sole, O.D. green. 
                         Try and keep your feet dry when we're 
                         out humpin'. I want you boys to 
                         remember to change your socks wherever 
                         we stop. The Mekong will eat a grunt's 
                         feet right off his legs.

               Lt. Dan steps over to a large black soldier named SERGEANT 
               SIMS.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Sergeant Sims! Goddamnit, where is 
                         that sling-rope I told you to order.

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         I put in requisitions at Battalion.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Yeah, yeah, yeah, well you call those 
                         sonabitches again, call them again 
                         and again and again. I don't care 
                         how much it takes...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Lt. Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt 
                         real lucky he was my lieutenant. He 
                         was from a long, great military 
                         tradition. Somebody in his family 
                         had fought and died in every single 
                         American war.

               EXT. VALLEY FORGE/THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR - DAY (1778)

               A distant relative of Lt. Dan's, wearing a revolutionary war 
               uniform, falls dead in the snow.

               EXT. GETTYSBURG/THE CIVIL WAR - DAY (1863)

               Another relative, wearing a civil war uniform and bearing a 
               striking resemblance to Lt. Dan, falls down dead.

               EXT. NORMANDY/WORLD WAR II - DAY (1944)

               Another relative, wearing a World War II, falls down dead on 
               the beach at Normandy.

               EXT. VETNAM/MEKONG DELTA/FIREBASE - DAY (1967)

                                     LT. DAN
                         Goddamnit, kick some ass!

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         I'm on it, Lieutenant.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Get on it!

               Lt. Dan steps back up to Bubba and Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I guess you could say he had a lot 
                         to live up to.

               Lt. Dan walks along the walkway and Bubba and Forrest follow.

                                     LT. DAN
                         So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
                         Well, I've been through there. Little 
                         Rock's a fine town. Now, go shake 
                         down your gear, see the platoon 
                         sergeant, draw what you need for the 
                         field.

               Lt. Dan steps inside the latrine, still holding the roll of 
               toilet paper.

                                     LT. DAN
                         If you boys are hungry, we got steaks 
                         burnin' right here.

               Lt. Dan sits down out of sight in the latrine, then stands 
               up, looking at the boys.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Two standing orders in this platoon.
                         One, take good care of your feet. 
                         Two, try not to do anything stupid, 
                         like gettin' yourself killed.

               Lt. Dan sits back down out of sight in the latrine. Bubba 
               and Forrest look at each other.

                                     FORREST
                         I sure hope I don't let him down.

               EXT. RICE FIELD - ANOTHER DAY

               Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon 
               walk across the rice field. Some Vietnamese rice farmers are 
               working as the soldiers walk past.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I got to see a lot of countryside. 
                         We would take these real long walks.

               EXT. JUNGLE/DIRT ROAD - ANOTHER DAY

               Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road.

                                     SONG
                         And we were always lookin' for this 
                         guy named Charlie. I can't get no 
                         relief.

               Suddenly Lt. Dan holds up his fist, a signal for the unit to 
               stop. He motions for them to get down.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Hold it up!

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         Hold up, boys!

               Forrest gets down and looks around.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It wasn't always fun. Lt. Dan always 
                         gettin' these funny feelings about a 
                         rock or a trail, or the road, so 
                         he'd tell you to get down, shut up!

                                     LT. DAN
                         Get down! Shut up!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So we did.

               Lt. Dan motions for the lead soldier to get down. Lt. Dan 
               crouches down. Lt. Dan looks at the soldiers and points to 
               his eyes. He lies down on the dirt road and crawls.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, I don't know much about anything, 
                         but I think some of American's best 
                         young men served in this war. There 
                         was Dallas, from Phoenix. Cleveland, 
                         he was from Detroit.

                                     CLEVELAND
                         Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex. Man, what the 
                         hell's going on?

               Tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And Tex was, well, I don't remember 
                         where Tex come from.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Ah, nothin'. Fourth Platoon, on your 
                         feet! Still got ten clicks to go to 
                         that river.

               Forrest stands up and begins to walk with the platoon.

                                     LT. DAN
                         All right, move out! Comin' out.
                         Look alive out there.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         The good thing about Vietnam is there 
                         was always someplace to go.

                                     LT. DAN (V.O.)
                         Fire in the hole!

               EXT. VIETNAM/VIET CONG FOXHOLE - ANOTHER DAY

               Lt. Dan walks away as Forrest rushes over, aims two pistols 
               in the hole, then climbs inside.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And there was always something to 
                         do.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Mount 'em up.

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         Spread out! Cover his back.

               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through a rice paddy, waits 
               deep in water. It begins to rain.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         One day it started raining, and it 
                         didn't quit for four months.

               EXT. JUNGLE

               The rain pours down on Forrest and Bubba as they sit in a 
               foxhole.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We been through every kind of rain 
                         there is. Little bitty stingin' 
                         rain...

               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through the jungle as rain 
               pours down on them.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...and big ol' fat rain.

               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon shelters themselves as they walk 
               through the wind and rain.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Rain that flew in sideways.

               ANOTHER DAY - Forrest and other soldiers walk chest-deep 
               through a river. The rain splatters back up from the river, 
               hitting the soldiers. Forrest holds his hand up to protect 
               his face.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And sometimes rain even seemed to 
                         come straight up from underneath.

               EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               The rain pours down on the men of the platoon as they sit in 
               a camp. Bubba sits down next to Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Shoot, it even rained at night.

               Bubba leans his back up against Forrest's back.

                                     BUBBA
                         Hey Forrest...

                                     FORREST
                         Hey Bubba...

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm gonna lean up against you, you

                         This way, we don't have to sleep 
                         with our heads in the mud. You know 
                         why we a good partnership, Forrest?
                         'Cause we be watchin' out for one 
                         another. Like brothers and stuff. 
                         Hey, Forrest, there's somethin' I've 
                         been thinkin' about. I got a very 
                         important question to ask you. How 
                         would you like to go into the 
                         shrimpin' business with me?

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

                                     BUBBA
                         Man, I tell you what, I got it all 
                         figured out, too. So many pounds of 
                         shrimp to pay off the boat, so many 
                         pounds for gas, we can just live 
                         right on the boat. We ain't got to 
                         pay no rent. I'll be the captain; we 
                         can just work it together. Split 
                         everything right down the middle.
                         Man, I'm tellin' you, fifty-fifty. 
                         And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp 
                         you can get.

                                     FORREST
                         That's a fine idea.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Bubba did have a fine idea.

               ANOTHER NIGHT - Some soldiers patrol the area. Forrest lies 
               in a pup tent and writes a litter as the rain pours down. He 
               uses his flashlight to see.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I even wrote Jenny and told her all 
                         about it. I sent her letters. Not 
                         every day, but almost. I told her 
                         what I was doin' and asked her what 
                         she was doing, and I told her how I 
                         thought about her always.

               EXT. JENNY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY

               Jenny steps out of the trailer with a backpack and a guitar.

               She hugs a hippie guy, then jumps into the back of a 
               Volkswagen bus with another guy.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And how I was looking forward to 
                         getting a letter from her just as 
                         soon as she had the time I'd always 
                         let her know that I was okay.

               EXT. VIETNAM - NIGHT

               Forrest writes a letter in his tent.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Then I'd sign each letter, "Love, 
                         Forrest Gump."

               EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

               The Fourth Platoon makes their way through the jungle and 
               rain.

                                     SONG

                         What it is ain't exactly clear. 
                         There's a man with a gun over there, 
                         telling' me I got to beware."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         This one day, we was out walking, 
                         like always, and then, just like 
                         that, somebody turned off the rain 
                         and the sun come out.

               Forrest looks up as the sun suddenly appears. Forrest's 
               platoon is attacked. A bullet kills the soldier standing 
               next to Forrest. Bombs explode all around as the soldiers 
               scramble to the ground.

                         Take cover!

               Forrest crawls over a berm as bullets fly overhead and explode 
               all around him. Forrest rolls over and pulls his pack off 
               Lt. Dan lies next to Forrest.

               Two soldiers with a machine gun fire into the jungle. Lt. 
               Dan shouts into the radio. Forrest begins firing his weapon 
               into the jungle.

               The machine gunner fires into the treeline. Another soldier 
               helps him with the ammunition. The machine gun jams.

               A rocket explodes on the machine gunner and the other soldier, 
               killing them. Forrest looks down and covers his head as 
               rockets explodes all around him.

               Lt. Dan gets up and grabs Forrest by the collar.

               The platoon gets up and runs toward the cover of the jungle.

               Rockets explode all around the field. Forrest runs into the 
               jungle. The soldiers run through the jungle as bullets explode 
               all around. A soldier is blown up by a rocket. A soldier 
               runs through the jungle. Forrest runs past the soldier.

                         I ran and ran, just like Jenny told 
                         me to.

               Rockets explode in the jungle as Forrest runs out toward a 
               clearing.

                         soon I was all by myself, which was

                         Bubba!

               Forrest turns around, then runs back into the jungle.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Bubba was my best good friend. I had 
                         to make sure he was okay.

               Rockets explode in the jungle. Forrest runs back into the 
               jungle to look for Bubba.

                         Where the hell are you?

               Forrest stops and aims his weapon. He looks around, scared.

                         Bubba?

               Something moves. Forrest turns and looks, then rushes over.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And on my way back to find Bubba, 
                         well, there was this boy laying on 
                         the ground.

                                     FORREST
                         Tex!

               Tex lies on the ground, his face distorted with pain.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

               Forrest reaches down and picks up Tex from the ground. Forrest 
               pulls Tex up over his shoulder, then runs.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I couldn't just let him lay there 
                         all alone, scared the way he was, so 
                         I grabbed him up and run him out of 
                         there.

               Forrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing.

               He sets Tex down on the bank of a river, and runs back into 
               the jungle.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And every time I went back looking 
                         for Bubba, somebody else was saying, 
                         "Help me, Forrest. Help me."

               Forrest drops another wounded soldier down at the bank of 
               the river next to Tex, and then runs back toward the jungle.

               Forrest grabs the third wounded soldier up from the ground 
               and turns him over. It is DALLAS.

                                     DALLAS
                         Can't hear... Can't hear...

               Dallas is dropped off at the bank next to the other wounded 
               soldiers. Forrest turns to go back to the jungle.

                                     2ND WOUNDED SOLDIER
                         No sweat, man. Just lay back. You're 
                         gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

                         I started to get scared that I might 
                         never find Bubba.

               Forrest trips over something and falls to the ground. He 
               looks up to find two bloody legs. It is Lt. Dan, who is 
               wounded. He speaks into the radio.

               Forrest tries to pick up Lt. Dan, who tries to push Forrest 
               away.

               Forrest pulls Lt. Dan over his shoulder and runs through the 
               jungle.

                         Ah, something bit me!

               Forrest gets up as Lt. Dan yells. Lt. Dan fires his pistol 
               at the unseen enemy as Forrest pulls him away.

                         leave the platoon! I told you to 
                         leave me there, Gump. Forget about 
                         me. Get yourself out! Did you hear 
                         what I said! Goddammit, pull me down!
                         Get your ass out of here!

               Forrest drops Lt. Dan down at the bank, next to the other 
               wounded soldiers. Lt. Dan grabs Forrest by the shirt, angry.

                                     LT. DAN
                         I didn't ask you to pull me out of

                         now. They're gonna nape the whole 
                         area.

               Forrest gets up and runs as Lt. Dan yells after him.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Gump, you stay here, goddammit! That's

                         I gotta find Bubba!

               Forrest runs through the jungle searching for Bubba. Forrest 
               slows down and looks around carefully.

               Bubba looks up as he lies on the ground.

                         I'm okay.

               Bubba holds a palm frond over his wound. Forrest removes the 
               frond to look at the wound. Bubba's chest has been blown 
               open.

                                     FORREST
                         Oh, Bubba, no...

                         Naw, I'm gonna be all right.

               Forrest looks around as he hear the voices of the enemy.

                         Come on. Come on. Come here...

               Forrest carries Bubba through the jungle. The sound of 
               approaching planes fills the air.

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm okay, Forrest. I'm all right.

               The roar of approaching planes is deafening. Forrest looks 
               up in fear. Three planes dive down toward the jungle. They 
               fire napalm as the jungle explodes with massive fireballs.

               Forrest runs, carrying Bubba. The fireballs explode behind 
               him. The entire jungle area is in flames as Forrest runs.

               Forrest carries Bubba to the bank of the river. Lt. Dan and 
               the other wounded soldiers wait for a rescue helicopter.

                         talk, I'd a thought of something 
                         better to say.

               Forrest looks down at Bubba. A soldier releases a smoke 
               canister.

               Forrest continues with his life story. A MAN is sitting next

                         that money, 'cause I still ain't

               FLASHBACK - INT. US. ARMY HOSPITAL/VIETNAM - DAY

               Forrest holds two ice cream cones in his hands as he is 
               wheeled on a rolling stretcher.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...is the ice cream. They gave me 
                         all the ice cream I could eat. And 
                         guess what. A good friend of mine 
                         was in the bed right next door.

               Forrest, lying on his stomach, is wheeled to his bed.

               Forrest's butt sticks up and is bandaged. Forrest looks at 
               Lt. Dan lying on the bed. Forrest holds out an ice cream 
               cone for Lt. Dan.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice 
                         cream. Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

               Lt. Dan, annoyed, takes the ice cream cone and drops it into 
               his bed pan. Forrest slides himself onto his bed. A NURSE 
               reaches toward Lt. Dan.

                                     MALE NURSE
                         It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

               The male nurse places Lt. Dan's hands on a pull-up bar, then 
               picks up Lt. Dan, whose legs have been amputated.

               Another nurse wheels the rolling bed under Lt. Dan. The male 
               nurse sets Lt. Dan down on the rolling bed. Forrest looks up 
               at Lt. Dan as he is wheeled away. A soldier reads the names 
               from a pile of letters.

               The soldier hands Forrest a large pile of letters.

               "Undeliverable as addressed. No forwarding order on file."

               Jenny Curran Rural Route 2 Greenbow, Ala. 39902 Forrest looks 
               down at the pile of letters.

               INT. ARMY HOSPITAL/VIETNAM - DAY

               A group of wounded soldiers hang out in the hospital, 
               recuperating. Forrest sits and watches "Gomer Pyle" on the 
               television.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Gump, how can you watch that stupid 
                         shit? Turn it off!

                         Vietnam Network. This is Channel 6, 
                         Saigon.

               Forrest turns the TV off and he is hit on the back of the 
               head by a ping-pong ball.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Good catch, Gump. You know how to 
                         play this?

               Forrest shakes his head.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Come on, let me show you. Here.

               The wounded ping-pong player hands Forrest a paddle. Forrest 
               and the wounded ping-pong player step toward the ping-pong 
               table.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Now the secret to this game is, no 
                         matter what happens, never, never 
                         take your eye off the ball.

               He holds the ball up and moves it back and forth. Forrest 
               keeps his eyes on the ball.

                                     SOLDIER
                         All right...

               The wounded ping-pong player tosses the ball down onto the 
               table. Forrest begins to hit the ball back to the other 
               player.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         For some reason, ping pong came very

                         I played ping-pong even when I didn't

               of wounded soldier sit and watch Forrest play with himself. 
               Forrest hits two balls at a time against the opposite side 
               of the table.

                         that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would 
                         come and watch me play.

               Lt. Dan stares out the window. Forrest lies in his bed asleep. 
               A hand reaches and grabs him.

               Lt. Dan pulls Forrest to the floor, and holds Forrest down.

                         Did you hear what I said? You cheated 
                         me. I had a destiny. I was supposed

                         That was my destiny! And you cheated 
                         me out of it! You understand what 
                         I'm saying, Gump? This wasn't supposed 
                         to happen. Not to me. I had a destiny.

               Lt. Dan looks at Forrest, lets go of Forrest and rolls.

               Lt. Dan sits up as Forrest looks at him.

               Forrest plays ping-pong by himself. An OFFICER walks up to

                         Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they 
                         want to give me a me...

               Forrest stops in mid-sentence as he looks down at the bed. A 
               heavily bandaged soldier with bloodstains lies there. Forrest 
               turns and look at the NURSE.

                                     FORREST
                         Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant 
                         Dan?

                                     NURSE
                         They sent him home.

                              (on T.V.)
                         The ceremony was kicked off with a 
                         candid speech by the President 
                         regarding the need for further 
                         escalation of the war in Vietnam. 
                         President Johnson awarded four Medals 
                         of Honor to men from each of the 
                         Armed Services.

               The television reveals Forrest as he is awarded the Medal of 
               Honor by President Johnson.

                                     PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                         America owes you a debt of gratitude, 
                         son.

               Color footage revealing President Johnson as he places the 
               award around Forrest's neck and shakes hands.

                                     PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                         I understand you were wounded. Where 
                         were you hit?

                                     FORREST
                         In the buttocks, sir.

                                     PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                         Oh, that must be a sight.

               President Johnson leans and whispers into Forrest's ear.

                                     PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                         I'd kinda like to see that.

               The television revealing Forrest as he drops his pants, bends 
               over and shows the bullet wound on his bare buttocks.

               President Johnson looks down and smiles. The three men in 
               the barber shop look up in disbelief. Mrs. Gump looks up in 
               shock.

                                     PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                         Goddamn, son.

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - DAY

               Forrest walks by the Lincoln Memorial. A fence surrounds the 
               Memorial, as well as armed military guards.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         After that, Momma went to the hotel 
                         to lay down, so I went out for a 
                         walk to see our national capital.

                                     ISABEL
                         Hilary, all right, I've got the vets, 
                         what do you want me to do with them?

                                     HILARY
                         What are you doing here so late?

               Forrest takes a photo of the memorial as a woman named Hilary 
               gathers together some veterans against the Vietnam War.

                                     HILARY
                         We've been waiting for you for half 
                         an hour, so just get them in a line, 
                         will you. Hey, hey, come on, pictures 
                         later. You look great. Oh come on, 
                         get in this line, come on, come on 
                         right in line. Come on, let him here, 
                         let him in here.

               Hilary grabs Forrest and puts him in the line with the other 
               vets against the war.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It's a good thing Momma was resting, 
                         'cause the street was awful crowded 
                         with people looking at all the statues 
                         and monuments. And some of them people 
                         were loud and pushy.

               Hilary leads the line of vets toward the large anti-Vietnam 
               War rally.

                                     HILARY
                         Okay, follow me! Come on.

               The group of vets walk as Forrest tries to take another 
               picture. A vet behind him pushes him along.

                                     HILARY
                         Let's move it out.

                         Hey, buddy, come on. We could use 
                         your help.

               Forrest walks in the line. A banner reads "Veterans against 
               the War in Vietnam."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)

                         Follow me, let's go!

               Hilary leads the vets through a crowd of people outside the 
               rally. Another woman, named Isabel, leads the vets toward 
               the back of a stage.

                                     ISABEL

                         Okay.

               A man, wearing an American flag shirt, stands on the stage.

               He is anti-war activist ABBIE HOFFMAN.

                         There was this man, giving a little 
                         talk. And for some reason, he was 
                         wearing an American flag for a 
                         shirt...

                         soldiers that are going to talk about

                         ...and he liked to say the "F" word.
                         A lot. "F" this and "F" that. And

                         ...these guys just told Lyndon Johnson 
                         where to stick this fucking war! 
                         Yeah!

               Forrest looks up at the cheering crowd. Abbie turns and 
               motions for Forrest to come up on the stage.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         Come on, man. Come up here, man.

                         Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!

               Hilary pulls Forrest up onto the stage.

                                     HILARY
                         Come on, get up there. Come on. Move, 
                         move. Let's go! Let's go.

               The other vets follow Forrest pushes onto the stage and push 
               him toward the microphones.

                                     VET
                         Come on, go. You can do it. Just get 
                         up there. Go on. That's it.

               Thousands of cheering protesters stand around the Washington 
               Monument. Forrest looks at the crowd. Abbie Hoffmann steps 
               up to Forrest.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         Tell us a little bit about the war, 
                         man.

                         The war in Viet-fucking-nam!

               Abbie raises his fist as the crowd cheers wildly.

                         There was only one thing I could say

                         say about the war in Vietnam.

               Forrest looks at the crowd as he speaks. A policeman looks 
               around as he sneaks over to the audio circuit board.

                                     FORREST

               The policeman pulls the patch cords out of the audio board.

               Forrest's amplified voice becomes inaudible. Forrest continues 
               to speak into the microphone, even though no one can hear 
               what he is saying. Hilary looks over and notices the 
               policeman. Hilary rushes over toward the audio board, pushes 
               the policeman away and grabs his night stick. Another 
               protester grabs the policeman and pulls him away.

                                     POLICEMAN

               Isabel, Hilary and another protester try to plug the tangled 
               mess of wires back into the audio board.

                                     ISABEL
                         Christ, what'd they do with this?

               Forrest continues to speak into the microphone. The crowd 
               grows restless.

               Forrest looks at the massive crowd. They are silent. Abbie 
               Hoffman steps over to Forrest and pats him on the shoulder.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         That's so right on, man. You said it

               Abbie raises his fist into the air. Abbie steps away from 
               Forrest. The crowd cheers.

               Jenny wades out into the reflection pool and waves her hand 
               into the air. Forrest recognizes her.

               Forrest rushes off the stage as Jenny makes her way out into

               Forrest jumps down into the crowd and runs. Jenny smiles as 
               she tries to run through the water. The crowd parts as Forrest 
               runs into the pool. Jenny rushes toward him.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey! Hey!

               The massive crowd cheers for the embracing couple in the 
               pool.

                         Jenny and me were just peas and 
                         carrots again. She showed me around, 
                         and even introduced me...

               INT. BLACK PANTHER HEADQUARTERS/STOREFRONT, D.C. - NIGHT

               Forrest stands at an open window and looks at the White House.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...to some of her new friends.

               A Black Panther, named RUBEN, steps over and pulls the shades 
               down.

                                     RUBEN
                         Shut that blind, man. And get your 
                         white ass away from that window.
                         Don't you know we in war here?

               Another Black Panther named MASAI grabs Forrest and pats him 
               down.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's 
                         one of us. He's one of us.

                                     MASAI
                         Let me tell you about us.

                                     WESLEY
                         Where the hell have you been?

                                     JENNY
                         I ran into a friend.

                                     MASAI
                         Our purpose here is to protect our 
                         black leaders from the racial 
                         onslaught of the pig who wishes to 
                         brutalize our black leaders, rape 
                         our women, and destroy our black 
                         communists.

                                     BLACK PANTHER
                         Masai, phone. Talk to these guys.

                                     WESLEY
                         Who's the baby killer?

                                     JENNY
                         This is my good friend I told you 
                         about. This is Forrest Gump. Forrest, 
                         this is Wesley. Wesley and I live 
                         together in Berkeley, and he's the 
                         president of the Berkeley chapter of 
                         S.D.S.

                                     MASAI
                         Let me tell you something else.

                                     WESLEY
                         I want to talk to you.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay, but...

                                     WESLEY
                         No. Now! Goddammit!

                                     MASAI
                         We are here to offer protection and 
                         help for all of those who need our 
                         help, because we, the Black Panthers, 
                         are against the war in Vietnam. Yes, 
                         we are against any war where black 
                         soldiers are sent to the front line 
                         to die for a country that hates them.
                         Yes, we are against any war where 
                         black soldiers go to fight and come 
                         to be brutalized and killed in their 
                         own communities as they sleep in 
                         their beds at night. Yes, we are 
                         against all these racists and imperial 
                         dog acts.

                                     JENNY
                         You are a fucking asshole!

               Wesley hits Jenny across the face. Slow motion -- Jenny falls 
               back. Slow motion -- Forrest steps forward with rage.

               Slow motion -- Wesley turns and looks at Forrest. Forrest 
               tackles Wesley and slams him onto a table. Jenny turns and 
               looks as Masai pulls out a gun.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest!
                         Stop it!

               Jenny rushes over to Forrest and pulls Forrest off Wesley.

                                     JENNY
                         Stop it!

               Jenny tries to help Wesley as he moans on the floor. Wesley 
               knocks Jenny's hand away. He gets up, holding his bloody 
               lip.

                                     WESLEY
                         Oh, God. I shouldn't have brought 
                         you here. I should have known it was 
                         just gonna be some bullshit hassle.

                                     FORREST
                         He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on, Forrest.

               Jenny steps out the door as Forrest picks up his hat.

                                     FORREST
                         Sorry I had a fight in the middle of 
                         your Black Panther party.

               The group of Black Panthers glare at Forrest. Forrest turns 
               and walks out the room.

               EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

               Forrest and Jenny walk past the White House. Protesters hold 
               a candlelight vigil behind them.

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't mean it when he does things 
                         like this. He doesn't.

                                     FORREST
                         I would never hurt you, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         I wanted to be your boyfriend.

               They walk in silence. Jenny touches Forrest's uniform.

                                     JENNY
                         That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You 
                         look handsome in it. You do.

                                     FORREST
                         You know what?

                                     JENNY
                         What?

                                     FORREST
                         I'm glad we were here together in 
                         our national capitol.

                                     JENNY
                         Me too, Forrest. I have so much to 
                         tell you, you won't believe what's 
                         been going on...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We walked around all night, Jenny 
                         and me, just talkin'.

               EXT. ROUTE 66 - FLASHBACK - DAY

               Jenny stands in the rain, hitchhiking. A car pulls over to 
               pick her up. Jenny and other other girls get into the car.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She told me about all the travellin' 
                         she's done.

               EXT. COMMUNE IN NEW MEXICO - NIGHT

               A hippie gives Jenny a sugar cube of acid as they sit in 
               front of a roaring fire.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And how she'd discovered ways to 
                         expand her mind and learn how to 
                         live in harmony...

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD/WALK OF FAME - DAY

               A star with the name "Jean Harlow" on the sidewalk. Jenny 
               and two other girls sing on the sidewalk and collect change 
               from the passersby. Jenny plays the guitar.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...which must be out west somewhere, 
                         'cause she made it all the way to 
                         California.

                                     JENNY
                              (sings)
                         "Smile on your brother, everybody 
                         get together, try to love on another 
                         right now"

               A young hippie looks over his faded Volkswagen at the girls.

                                     YOUNG HIPPIE
                         Hey, anybody want to go to San 
                         Francisco?

                                     JENNY
                         I'll go.

                                     YOUNG HIPPIE
                         Far out!

               EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAWN

               Forrest and Jenny walk through the park.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I was a very special night for the 
                         two of us. I didn't want it to end.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

               Jenny carries a backpack as she prepares to board a bus back 
               to Berkeley.

                                     FORREST
                         I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         I have to, Forrest.

                                     WESLEY
                         Jenny? Things got a little out of 
                         hand. It's just this war and that, 
                         that lyin' son-of-a-bitch Johnson. I 
                         would never hurt you. You know that.

                                     FORREST
                         You know what I think? I think you 
                         should go home to Greenbow. Alabama!

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, we have very different lives, 
                         you know.

               Forrest looks down at Jenny. He pulls his Medal of Honor 
               from around his neck.

                                     FORREST
                         I want you to have this.

               Forrest places the Medal of Honor in Jenny's hand. Jenny 
               looks up at him.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, I can't keep this.

                                     FORREST
                         I got it just by doing what you told 
                         me to do.

                                     JENNY
                         Why're you so good to me?

                                     FORREST
                         You're my girl.

                                     JENNY
                         I'll always be your girl.

               Jenny and Forrest hug each other. Wesley waits for Jenny.

               Jenny turns and walks up to Wesley. They walk toward the 
               entrance of the bus. Forrest smiles as Jenny looks at her.

               Jenny climbs up into the bus. Wesley glares at Forrest.

               Forrest gives Wesley the "evil eye." Jenny through the near 
               window of the bus, knocks on the window. Forrest turns and 
               looks. Jenny waves to Forrest. Forrest looks up and smiles 
               sadly. Jenny gives Forrest the peace sign as the bus pulls 
               away. The sign on the back of the bus reads "Berkeley to 
               D.C." Forrest gives Jenny the peace sign.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And just like that, she was gone out 
                         of my life again.

               INT. VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL/REC ROOM - DAY

               A footage of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon on 
               television.

                                     NEIL ARMSTRONG
                         That's one small step for man, one 
                         giant leap for mankind. The, uh, the 
                         surface is fine and powdery. I can, 
                         I can pick it up loosely.

               Forrest demonstrates a ping-pong to some wounded vets.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I thought I was going back to Vietnam, 
                         but instead, they decided the best 
                         way for me to fight communists was 
                         to play ping-pong. So I was in the 
                         Special Services, traveling around 
                         the country cheering up all them 
                         wounded veterans and showing them 
                         how to play...

               BUS STOP - PRESENT - DAY

               Forrest looks at a man.

                                     FORREST
                         ...ping-pong. I was so good that 
                         some years later...

               EXT. CHINA/PING-PONG TOURNAMENT - FLASHBACK - DAY

               Forrest plays ping-pong against a Chinese player. A large 
               mural of Mao Tse-tung hangs on the wall. A crowd of communist 
               leaders sit and watch.

                         Some years later, that nice young 
                         man from England was on his way home 
                         to see his little boy and was signing 
                         some autographs. For no particular 
                         reason at all, somebody shot him.

               A guard lets Forrest out a side entrance door. Forrest steps, 
               an then stops as he hears s man sitting in a wheelchair speak 
               to him.

               Forrest looks at Lt. Dan. He is a dirty with long hair.

                         say to that. Goddamn bless America.

               Lt. Dan's wheelchair begins to slide down the ramp and spins 
               around on the icy ground. Forrest looks down at Lt. Dan 
               crashes at the bottom of the ramp.

               Taxi cabs crowd the street as Forrest pushes Lt. Dan along 
               the sidewalk.

                         Lieutenant Dan said he was living in 
                         a hotel. And because he didn't have 
                         no legs, he spent most of his time 
                         exercising his arms.

               A taxi driver honks his horn as Forrest wheels Lt. Dan out 
               in front of the taxi.

                         Sucking it dry.

               A taxi skids to a stop, almost hitting them as they cross 
               the street. The taxi honks at Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan slaps the 
               bumper of the taxi.

                         looking for him, sir.

               Lt. Dan chuckles, drinks the rest of a bottle of wine and 
               tosses it down. He looks at Forrest. He wheels himself over 
               to television and turns it off.

                         about.

               Lt. Dan picks up another bottle of port wine, but it is empty. 
               He tosses it onto the floor.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Jesus this and Jesus that. Have I 
                         found Jesus? They even had a priest 
                         come and talk to me. He said God is 
                         listening, but I have to help myself.
                         Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart, 
                         I'll get to walk beside him in the 
                         Kingdom of Heaven.

               Lt. Dan tosses the empty liquor bottle down and picks another 
               bottle. He becomes enraged as he throws the bottle and looks 
               at Forrest.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Did you hear what I said? Walk beside 
                         him in the Kingdom of Heaven. Well,

                         Don't you just love New Year's? You 
                         get to start all over.

                                     CARLA
                         Hey, Lenore.

                                     LENORE
                         Everybody gets a second chance.

                         It's funny, but in the middle of all 
                         that fun, I began to think about 
                         Jenny.

               INT. APARTMENT/L.A. - NIGHT

               The New Year's Eve celebration over the T.V.

                         ...pour here in Times Square. It's 
                         been off-and-on all night, but these 
                         people hang in there.

               Jenny fills her bag with her belongings.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Wondering how she was spending her 
                         New Year's night out in California.

               A man lies passed out on the bed. Jenny looks at her black 
               eye in a mirror, then leaves the apartment. The TV shows the 
               ball in Times Square.

                                     CROWD

               INT. TIMES SQUARE BAR - NIGHT

               The ball is lowered, lighting up a sign that reads "1972."

                                     CROWD

                         ...1! Happy New Year!

               The people in the bar cheer and kiss each other. They blow 
               horns and toss confetti into the air. Forrest looks around 
               as Carla and Lenore lean over and kiss him.

               INT. LT. DAN'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

               Carla removes her top and sits on top of Dan in his 
               wheelchair. They kiss and play around. Forrest sits in a 
               chair. Lenore leaps on him and begins to kiss Forrest. She 
               reaches down to Forrest's crotch. Forrest stands up nervously, 
               causing Lenore to fall down on the floor. Lenore stands up, 
               angry.

                                     LENORE
                         What are you, stupid or something?
                         What's your problem? What's his 
                         problem? Did you lose your pecker in 
                         the war or something?

                                     CARLA
                         What, is your friend stupid or 
                         something?

                         I said, is your friend stupid or 
                         something?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Hey! Don't call him stupid!

               Lt. Dan throws Carla back onto the bed.

                                     CARLA
                         Don't push me like that!

                         You shut up! Don't you ever call him 
                         stupid!

                                     CARLA
                         What's the matter, baby? Why you 
                         treating me like shit?

                         shit!

                         Get out of here!

               Lt. Dan falls out of his wheelchair and lands down on the 
               floor. Carla and Lenore laugh as they leave the apartment.

                                     CARLA

                         You loser! You freak!

               Forrest tries to help Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan pushes Forrest away.

                                     LT. DAN
                         No!

               Forrest steps back as Lt. Dan flips back over, then pulls 
               himself back up onto his wheelchair. He breathes heavily.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's

                         like cigarettes.

                         I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's 
                         some things you just can't change. 
                         He didn't want to be called crippled, 
                         just like I didn't want to be called

                         And I met the President of the United

                         Security, Frank Wills.

               Forrest steps over to a window. Flashlights are moving around 
               in an office across from Forrest's room.

               Forrest hangs up the phone. The camera tilts down, revealing

               INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

               President Nixon makes a resignation speech on TV.

                         Therefore, I shall resign the 
                         Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.

               The television cuts to a shot of President Nixon standing 
               outside Air Force One with his hands in the peace sign.

                                     PRESIDENT NIXON

                         Vice President Ford will be sworn in 
                         as President at that hour in this 
                         office. As I recall the high hopes 
                         for America with which we began this 
                         second term, I feel a great sadness 
                         that I will not be here in this 
                         office...

               Forrest is playing ping-pong by himself at the gymnasium. An 
               officer steps up to him.

                                     OFFICER
                         Sergeant Gump!

                         As you were. I have your discharge 
                         papers. Your service is up, son.

               The officer hands Forrest an envelope, then walks away.

                         Does this mean I can't play ping

                                     OFFICER

                         And just like that, my service in 
                         the United States Army was over. So 
                         I went home.

               Forrest takes his paddle and runs out of the gymnasium.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Mrs. Gump walks out of the house and smiles. Forrest walks 
               up to the house, wearing his uniform.

                         Now, when I got home, I had no idea 
                         that Momma had had all sorts of 
                         visitors.

               In the house are stacks of ping-pong paddles and life-sized 
               cardboard cutouts of Forrest playing ping-pong. The name on 
               the ping-pong paddles boxes reads: "Gump-Mao table tennis."

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         We've had all sorts of visitors, 
                         Forrest. Everybody wants you to use 
                         their ping-pong stuff. One man even 
                         left a check for twenty-five thousand 
                         dollars if you'd be agreeable to 
                         saying you like using their paddle.

                                     FORREST
                         Oh, Momma. I only like using my own 
                         paddle. Hi, Miss Louise.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hey, Forrest.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         I know that. I know that. But it's 
                         twenty-five thousand dollars, Forrest.
                         I thought maybe you could hold it 
                         for a while, see if it grows on you. 
                         Oh, you look good, Forrest. You look 
                         real good.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         That Momma, she sure was right. It's 
                         funny how things work out.

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE/BUBBA'S MOM'S HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest walks up to a shack on the edge of the Bayou. A group 
               of black kids play in the front yard.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I didn't stay home for long, because 
                         I'd made a promise to Bubba. And I 
                         always try to keep my promise. So I 
                         went on down to Bayou La Batre to 
                         meet Bubba's family and make their 
                         introduction.

               Bubba's mother named MRS. BLUE and her other children look 
               at Forrest.

                                     MRS. BLUE
                         Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

                                     FORREST
                         Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

                                     MRS. BLUE
                         I guess.

               EXT. BUBBA'S GRAVE - DAY

               Forrest steps over to Bubba's tombstone.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And of course, I paid my respect to 
                         Bubba himself.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump. I 
                         remember everything you said, and I 
                         got it all figured out.

               Forrest pulls out notes from his pocket.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm taking the twenty-four thousand, 
                         five hundred and six-two dollars and 
                         forty-seven cents that I got...

               EXT. BAYOU - DAY

               Forrest walks across a yard where men are cleaning shrimp.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...well, that's left after a new 
                         hair cut and a new suit and I took 
                         Momma out to real fancy dinner and I 
                         bought a bus ticket and three Doctor 
                         Peppers.

               Forrest walks along a wooden pier. Forrest pays an old black 
               shrimper a large wad of cash.

                                     OLD SHRIMPER
                         Tell me something. Are you stupid or 
                         something?

                                     FORREST
                         Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

               EXT. BUBBA'S GRAVE

               Forrest stands at the grave.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, that's what's left after me 
                         saying, "When I was in China on the 
                         All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just
                         loved playing ping-pong with my Flex-
                         O-Ping-Pong Paddle." Which everybody 
                         knows it isn't true, but Momma says 
                         it's just a little white lie so it 
                         wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway, 
                         I'm putting all that on gas, ropes 
                         and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' 
                         boat.

               EXT. BAYOU - DAY

               Forrest steers his shrimping boat. The boat is old and rusty.

               Forrest unleashes his nets as his catch of the day drops to 
               the deck. It is a bunch of garbage and shells. Forrest picks 
               up one shrimp.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, Bubba had told me everything he 
                         knows about shrimpin', but you know 
                         what I found out? Shrimpin' is tough.

               EXT. DOCKS

               Forrest pulls a couple of shrimp out of a bucket.

                                     FORREST
                         I only caught five.

                                     OLD SHRIMPER
                         A couple of more, you can have 
                         yourself a cocktail.

               The old shrimper begins to walk away, then stops and looks 
               at Forrest.

                                     OLD SHRIMPER
                         Hey, you ever think about namin' 
                         this old boat?

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I'd never named a boat before, but 
                         there was only one I could think of.

               Forrest paints a name on the side of his boat. The name is 
               "Jenny."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         The most beautiful name in the wide 
                         world.

               INT. DISCO

               Disco lights flash and people dance. A guy asks a girl to 
               dance.

                                     GIRL
                         Okay.

               Jenny sits at a table with some other people. She is snorting 
               cocaine.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny in a 
                         long while. But...

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE - DAY

               Forrest stands at the helm as the boat glides across the 
               water.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But I thought about her a lot. And I 
                         hoped that whatever she was doing 
                         made her happy.

               INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Drug paraphernalia and a large wad of cash are spread out on 
               a table. A man drops a syringe on the table. He reaches over 
               and touches Jenny. She is pale with dark lines under her 
               eyes.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Jenny smears some lines of cocaine on a mirror. She looks at 
               herself in the mirror.

               EXT. BALCONY

               Jenny steps out onto the high-rise balcony. She steps up on 
               a table and stands on the edge of the balcony. A busy street 
               lies many stories below. Jenny looks down to the intersection 
               below.

               She slips over the edge, regains her balance, turns and looks 
               back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from 
               the edge.

               Jenny grabs a hold of the ledge and carefully climbs down.

               She sits down on a chair. Jenny rocks back and forth as she 
               cries. She looks up at the sky.

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE/FORREST'S BOAT - NIGHT

               The moon shines above in the sky. Forrest lies in a hammock 
               on his boat.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I thought about Jenny all the time.

               EXT. FORREST'S BOAT/BAYOU DOCK - DAY

               Forrest stands at the helm of his boat and slowly glides by 
               the docks. Forrest looks around and notices something and 
               bends down to get a clear view. Lt. Dan sits in his wheelchair 
               on the deck. Forrest looks at Lt. Dan. He smiles, surprised.

                                     FORREST
                         Hi!

               Forrest leaps off of his moving boat and into the water. The 
               boat continues as Forrest clumsily swims. Lt. Dan sits in 
               his wheelchair at the edge of the dock. Forrest flails his 
               arms as he swims up to the dock. Lt. Dan waits for Forrest, 
               smoking a cigar. Forrest climbs up a ladder onto the dock.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing 
                         here?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Well, I thought I'd try out my sea 
                         legs.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, you ain't got no legs, 
                         Lieutenant Dan.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Well, well, Captain Forrest Gump. I 
                         had to see this for myself. And I 
                         told you if you were ever a shrimp 
                         boat captain, that I'd be your first 
                         mate. Well, here I am. I am a man of 
                         my word.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

               Forrest shakes Lt. Dan's hand.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Yeah, but don't you be thinking that 
                         I'm gonna be calling you sir.

                                     FORREST
                         No, sir.

               Forrest's boat glides, crushing a dock. Forrest and Lt. Dan 
               look at it.

                                     FORREST
                         That's my boat.

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE WATERS - DAY

               Forrest's shrimping boat is alone on the gulf waters.

                                     LT. DAN
                         I have a feeling if we head the east, 
                         we'll find some shrimp. So, take a 
                         left. Take a left.

               Forrest looks up. Lt. Dan is sitting in the rigging.

                                     FORREST
                         Which way?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Over there! They're over there! Get, 
                         get on the wheel and take a left!

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Gump, what are you doing? Take a 
                         left! Left! That's where we're gonna 
                         find those shrimp, my boy! That's 
                         where we'll find 'em.

               Forrest empties the net. Their "catch" is debris that falls 
               to the deck.

                                     FORREST
                         Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Okay, so I was wrong.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, how we gonna find them?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Well, maybe you should just pray for 
                         shrimp.

               INT. SMALL CHURCH - DAY

               The all-black gospel choir sings and claps their hands.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So I went to church every Sunday...

               Lt. Dan is sitting in his chair at the back of the church. 
               He takes swigs from a liquor bottle.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too.
                         Though I think he left the praying 
                         up to me.

               EXT. BOAT - ANOTHER DAY

               A catch of junk is dumped onto the deck. Lt. Dan lowers 
               himself from the rigging.

                                     FORREST
                         No shrimp.

               EXT. CHURCH

               The sign reads: "Four Square Baptist Church." A new cross is 
               placed on the steeple. New furniture is taken inside.

                         ...and the rest is just for showing 
                         off. So, I gave a whole bunch of it 
                         to the Four Square Gospel Church.

               EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

                         And I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou

               EXT. BUBBA'S MOM'S HOUSE

               A postman delivers a letter to Bubba's mom. She opens the 
               letter.

                         And even though Bubba was dead, and 
                         Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts. I 
                         gave Bubba's mommy Bubba's share.

               She is surrounded by her many children. She looks at the

                         And 'cause I was godzillionaire and 
                         I liked doing it so much. I cut that 
                         grass for free.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE BALCONY - NIGHT

               Forrest looks down the road as he steps onto the porch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But at nighttime, when there was 
                         nothing to do and the house was all 
                         empty, I'd always think of Jenny.

               Jenny's image walks, then vanishes. Forrest looks away. He 
               turns and walks into the house.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Jenny walks across the lawn to Forrest.

                         And then, she was there.

                                     JENNY
                         Hello, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Hello, Jenny.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Jenny came back and stayed with me.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE

               Jenny lies asleep in bed.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Maybe it was because she had nowhere 
                         else to go. Or maybe it was because 
                         she was so tired, because she went 
                         to bed and slept and slept like she 
                         hadn't slept in years. It was 
                         wonderful having her home.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Forrest and Jenny walking.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd 
                         jabber on like a monkey in a tree.
                         And she'd listen about ping-pong and 
                         shrimpin' boats and Momma makin' a 
                         trip to heaven. I did all the talkin'. 
                         Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

                                     FORREST
                         ...big ol' gobs of rain and little 
                         bitty stinging rain and rain...

               Jenny's old house stands at the end of the dirt road. It 
               appears to be deserted. Jenny walks toward the house and 
               stops. She stares at the house. Forrest walks toward Jenny.

               Jenny suddenly heaves a rock angrily at the house. She throws 
               other things at the house.

                                     JENNY
                         How could you do this?

               She breaks a window. Jenny collapses to the ground and sobs.

               Forrest knees down next to her.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes I guess there just aren't 
                         enough rocks.

               EXT. OLD OAK TREE - DAY

               Jenny and Forrest sit on a limb together.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I never really knew why she came 
                         back, but I didn't care. It was like 
                         olden times. We was like peas and 
                         carrots again.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Jenny sits by the vase of flowers and look out the window.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Every day I'd pick pretty flowers 
                         and put them in her room for her.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest closes his eyes as he sits on the porch. Jenny places 
               a box of Nike running shoes in his lap.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And she gave me the best gift anyone 
                         could ever get in the wide world.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay, you can open your eyes.

                         They make them just for running.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Through the windows, Forrest and Jenny are dancing as it 
               rains outside.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And she even showed me how to dance.
                         And, well, we was like family... 
                         Jenny and me.

               EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

               Jenny and Forrest sit on a log together and look at the river.

               Jenny places her arms around Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And it was the happiest time of my

               The fireworks explode in the sky.

               INT. GUMP'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Statue of Liberty is shown on the TV. Fireworks go off.

               Forrest and Jenny are watching the 4th of July celebration

                                     JENNY
                         You done watching it?

                                     FORREST
                         Mm-hmm.

                         earlier, the Statue of Liberty...

               Jenny stands up and kisses Forrest on the cheek.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm going to bed.

               Jenny turns off the TV and walks outside. Forrest stands as 
               he puts down his Dr. Pepper. Jenny walks toward the stairs.

                                     FORREST
                         Will you marry me? I'd make a good 
                         husband, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         You would, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         But you won't marry me.

                                     JENNY
                         You don't want to marry me.

                                     FORREST
                         Why don't you love me, Jenny? I'm 
                         not a smart man, but I know what 
                         love is.

               Forrest turns and walks toward the door. Jenny turns and 
               walks up the stairs. Forrest stands outside.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               The house stands in the rain.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest lies in his bed as the door opens. Jenny gets into 
               bed next to Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny?

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, I do love you.

               Jenny and Forrest kiss. Jenny takes off her nightgown as 
               they make love.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING

               Jenny carries her purse and walks toward a waiting cab.

                                     CAB DRIVER
                         Where are you running off to?

                                     JENNY
                         I'm not running.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE

               The cab drives away as Forrest is asleep in his bed. The 
               Congressional Medal lies on a table by a ping-pong paddle.

               Forrest holds a glass of milk and wears his bathrobe. He 
               looks at the medal he had give to Jenny. Jenny's bed is made. 
               Forrest stands in the doorway looking at the room and bed 
               where Jenny had been.

               EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

               Forrest sit on a rocking chair with his running shoes on. He 
               is still, as if in a trance. He slowly puts on his Bubba-
               Gump cap. Forrest stands. He walks off the porch. He begins 
               to jog across the lawn. His speed increases as he runs farther 
               away. Forrest runs down the drive away from his house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         That day, for no particular reason, 
                         I decided to go for a little run.

               Forrest runs to the end of the drive, then turns right and 
               runs down the highway.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So I ran to the end of the road, and 
                         when I got there, I thought maybe 
                         I'd run to the end of town.

               INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

               The three men sit as they watch the television. Forrest runs 
               through the main street of town.

               The sign reads "Entering Greenbow County."

                         ...I thought maybe I'd just run across 
                         Greenbow County. And I figured since 
                         I run this far, maybe I'd just run 
                         across the great...

               Forrest runs by a sign that reads "Mississippi welcomes you. 
               The Magnolia State."

                         For no particular reason, I just 
                         kept on going. I ran clear to the 
                         ocean.

               EXT. SANTA MONICA - DAY

               The sign reads "Santa Monica yacht harbor sports fishing - 
               boating - cafes." Forrest runs under the sign and onto the 
               pier.

                         And when I got there, I figured since 
                         I'd gone this far, I might as well 
                         turn around, just keep on going.

               EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN

                         When I got to another ocean, I figured 
                         since I've gone this far, I might as 
                         well just turn back, keep right on 
                         going.

               Forrest runs across the pier. A lighthouse stands at the end 
               of the pier.

                         such a big inspiration to the people

                         fella did come up with a bumper

               Forrest runs, followed by his group, as a man runs up to

                         Another time I was running along, 
                         somebody who had lost all his money 
                         in the T-shirt business, and he wanted 
                         to put my face on a T-shirt, but he 
                         couldn't draw that well and he didn't 
                         have a camera.

                         I think it would be really fortunate

                         these T-shirts. It would be wonderful.

               A truck splashes mud onto Forrest as it goes by. The man 
               hands Forrest a yellow T-shirt to use as a rag to wipe the 
               mud off.

                         that color anyway.

               Forrest wipes his face on the towel and hands it back to the 
               man.

               "Happy Face."

                         fourteen days, and sixteen hours.

               Forrest stops running. The group stops behind him. Forrest

                         Down that way?

                         Down that way.

               Forrest hastily grabs his suitcase and letter as he stands.

                                     FORREST
                         It was nice talking' to you.

               Forrest runs, the elderly woman shouts from the bus stop 
               bench. A truck honks its horn as Forrest runs across the 
               street past the truck.

                                     ELDERLY WOMAN
                         I hope everything works out for you.

               INT. JENNY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Jenny opens the door.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey! Forrest! How you doing?

                                     FORREST
                         Hi.

                                     FORREST
                         I got your letter.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, I was wondering about that.

               Jenny shuts the door. Forrest looks around.

                                     FORREST
                         Is this your house?

                                     JENNY
                         Yeah, it's messy right now. I just 
                         got off work.

                                     FORREST
                         It's nice. You got air conditioning.

               Forrest hands Jenny the box of chocolates.

                                     FORREST
                         Ah...

                                     JENNY
                         Thank you.

                                     FORREST
                         I ate some.

               Jenny picks up a scrapbook and turns the pages.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, I kept, I kept a scrapbook of 
                         your, of your clippings and

                         I ran a long way. For a long time.

                                     JENNY
                         There. Listen, Forrest. I don't know 
                         how to say this. Um, I just... I 
                         want to apologize for anything that 
                         I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed 
                         up for a long time, and...

               There is a knock at the door. LYNN MARIE enters as she opens 
               the door.

                                     LYNN MARIE
                         Yoo-hoo.

                         Hi.

               Jenny grabs a young boy.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, you. This is an old friend from 
                         Alabama.

                                     LYNN MARIE
                         Oh, how do you do?

                                     JENNY

                         No problem. Got to go, Jen. I'm double 
                         parked.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay.

               Lynn Marie closes the door and waves bye to Forrest.

                                     LYNN MARIE
                         Bye.

                                     JENNY
                         Thanks. This is very good friend,

                         Hello.

                         Now, can I go watch TV now?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

               The little boy runs into other room and picks up TV remote 
               control.

                                     FORREST
                         You're a momma, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm a momma. His name is Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Like me.

                                     JENNY
                         I named him after his Daddy.

                                     FORREST
                         He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

                                     JENNY
                         You're his daddy, Forrest.

               Forrest continues to stare at Forrest Jr. Forrest then looks 
               frightened and starts to back away.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, Forrest, look at me. Look at 
                         me, Forrest. There's nothing you 
                         need to do, okay? You didn't do 
                         anything wrong. Okay?

               Jenny turns and looks at Forrest Jr. in the other room.

                                     JENNY
                         Isn't he beautiful?

                                     FORREST
                         He's the most beautiful thing I've 
                         ever seen. But... is, is he smart, 
                         or is he...

                                     JENNY
                         He's very smart. He's one of the 
                         smartest in his class.

               Forrest breathes deep. He looks at Jenny, then at Forrest 
               Jr.

                                     JENNY
                         Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

               Forrest walks into the room and sits down next to Forrest 
               Jr. "Sesame Street" is on the TV.

                                     BERT

                         A hand? Well, yeah, what do you want,

                         I have pencils right here to write 
                         with, Bert. Now, we got, uh, paper. 
                         I'll take that paper, Bert. See, we 
                         have the paper to write on.

               EXT. PARK - DAY

               Forrest and Jenny sit on a bench. Forrest Jr. swings behind 
               them.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, I'm sick.

                         Would you marry me, Forrest?

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               A group has gathered on the lawn for the wedding. Louise

                         Forrest, it's time to start.

               Jenny walks out of the house. Forrest walks over to greet 
               her. She wears a white dress. She walks up to Forrest and 
               adjusts his necktie.

                                     JENNY
                         Hi. Your tie.

               Lt. Dan is walking across the lawn. He uses a cane. A WOMAN

               Jenny walks over to Forrest and Lt. Dan.

               Lt. Dan lifts his pant leg to display his metal leg.

               Susan shakes Forrest's hand.

                         Hi, Forrest.

                         Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

                         Hey, it's nice to meet you, finally.

               Jenny steps forward and kisses Lt. Dan's cheek. The group is 
               seated as they watch Forrest and Jenny take vows on the front 
               lawn. Forrest Jr. stands next to Jenny.

                                     MINISTER
                         Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be 
                         your wife? Do you, Jenny, take Forrest 
                         to be your husband? If so, I pronounce 
                         you man and wife.

               The wind blows fallen leaves across the ground. Jenny, 
               Forrest, and Forrest Jr. walk toward the house. They all 
               hold hands as they walk.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING

               Forrest steps into Jenny's bedroom. He carries a tray with 
               breakfast on it. Forrest looks at Jenny as she sleeps.

               Slowly she wakes up and looks at Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey.

                         Hey.

               Forrest sets the tray down next to Jenny as she sits up in 
               bed. Forrest opens a window, then sits down next to the bed.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, Forrest, were you scared in 
                         Vietnam?

                                     FORREST
                         Yes. Well, I, I don't know.

               EXT. VIETNAM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

               Forrest looks up into the sky as the rain stops. Forrest 
               removes his helmet. The stars emerge from behind the clouds.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes it would stop raining long 
                         enough for the stars to come out. 
                         And then it was nice. It was like 
                         just before the sun goes to bed down 
                         on the bayou...

               EXT. BAYOU - FLASHBACK - SUNSET

               Forrest stands on his boat and looks at a deep orange and 
               red sunset.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         There was over a million sparkles on 
                         the water. Like that mountain lake.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - FLASHBACK - DAY

               Forrest runs along a highway. A lake reflects the mountains 
               and the sky.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It was so clear, Jenny. It looks 
                         like there were two skies, one on 
                         top of the other. And then in the 
                         desert, when the sun comes up...

               EXT. DESERT - FLASHBACK - SUNRISE

               Forrest runs along a desert highway. The morning light casts 
               an orange glow over the desert.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I couldn't tell where heavens stopped 
                         and the earth began. It was so 
                         beautiful.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING

               Forrest looks at Jenny. Jenny looks out the window.

                                     JENNY
                         I wish I could have been there with 
                         you.

                                     FORREST
                         You were.

               Jenny reaches over and takes Forrest's hand.

                                     JENNY
                         I love you.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         You died on a Saturday morning.

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE AT OLD OAK TREE - DAY

               Forrest stands under the old oak tree where Jenny has been 
               buried.

                                     FORREST
                         And I had you placed here under our 
                         tree.

               Jenny's grave marker. Forrest tries to hold back his tears.

                                     FORREST
                         And I had that house of your father's 
                         bulldozed to the ground.

               EXT. JENNY'S OLD HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest watches as Jenny's dad's house is knocked down by a 
               bulldozer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma...

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE

                                     FORREST
                         ...always said dyin' was a part of 
                         life.

               Jenny's grave marker reads: JENNY GUMP July 16, 1945 -- March 
               22, 1982 Beloved Mother, Wife and Friend

                                     FORREST
                         I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest, 
                         he's doing just fine.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest Jr. reads a book to Forrest sitting next to him.

                                     FORREST JR.
                              (reading)
                         "But he wasn't quite sure. Everywhere 
                         they went, the new guests...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         About to start school again soon. I 
                         make his breakfast, lunch, and 
                         dinner...

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE

               Forrest looks down as he sobs.

                                     FORREST
                         ...every day. I make sure he combs 
                         his hair and brushes his teeth every 
                         day. Teaching him how to play ping 
                         pong.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest tries to teach Forrest Jr. how to play ping-pong.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He's really good.

                                     FORREST
                         Forrest, you go.

               Forrest Jr. serves the ball, causing Forrest dive and miss 
               it.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE/RIVER - DAY

               Forrest and Forrest Jr. sit on a log by the river and fish.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We fish a lot.

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE

               Forrest looks down at the grave marker.

                                     FORREST
                         And every night, we read a book.
                         He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so 
                         proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a 
                         letter, and he says I can't read it. 
                         I'm not supposed to, so I'll just 
                         leave it here for you.

               Forrest places the letter down at the grave marker, next to 
               fresh flowers. The name on the envelope reads: "Mom." Forrest 
               steps back and looks down at the grave.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny, I don't know if Momma was 
                         right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan.
                         I don't know if we each have a 
                         destiny, or if we're all just floating 
                         around accidental-like on a breeze, 
                         but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe 
                         both is happening at the same time. 
                         I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything 
                         you need, I won't be far away.

               As Forrest walks away, a flock of birds flies overhead and 
               lands in the tree. Forrest turns and watches.

               EXT. ROAD - MORNING

               Forrest walks with Forrest Jr. for the bus. The bus drives 
               toward them.

                                     FORREST
                         Here's your bus. Okay.

               Forrest pulls "Curious George" out of Forrest Jr.'s backpack.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey, I know this.

                                     FORREST JR.
                         I'm gonna show that for show-and-
                         tell because grandma used to read it 
                         to you.

               Forrest looks at the book. The feather from the beginning of 
               the movie drops out of the book, unnoticed.

                                     FORREST
                         My favorite book.

               The bus comes to a stop. The door opens.

                                     FORREST
                         Well...

               Forrest puts the book back into Forrest Jr.'s backpack and 
               hands it to him.

                                     FORREST
                         ...okay. Hey, there you go.

               Forrest Jr. walks toward the bus. Forrest stands up.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey, Forrest. Don't... I wanted to 
                         tell you I love you.

                                     FORREST JR.
                         I love you too, Daddy.

                                     FORREST
                         I'll be right here when you get back.

               Forrest Jr. looks into the bus and at the bus driver. It is 
               the same bus driver, only older now, who drove Forrest to 
               school when he was a young boy.

                                     SCHOOLD BUS DRIVER
                         You understand this is the bus to 
                         school now, don't you?

                                     FORREST JR.
                         Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris 
                         and I'm Forrest Gump.

               Forrest Jr. looks over and waves to his father. Forrest nods 
               approvingly.

               Forrest Jr. gets on the bus. The bus pulls away. Forrest 
               stands next to the mailbox.

               Forrest sits down. The camera cranes down, revealing the 
               feather as it lies at Forrest's feet.

               A gust of wind picks the feather up. The feather floats up 
               into the air.

               Forrest sits at the side of the road. The feather floats 
               higher into the air.

               The feather soars up into the sky and travels up and down, 
               then covers the camera lens.

                                         THE END
"FORREST GUMP"

               EXT. A SAVANNAH STREET - DAY (1981)

               A feather floats through the air. The falling feather.

               A city, Savannah, is revealed in the background. The feather 
               floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down 
               toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive 
               by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder.

               He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked 
               back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car. 
               The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward 
               the street.

               The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying 
               back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather 
               floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's 
               mudsoaked shoe.

               The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is 
               FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a 
               box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case.

               Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a 
               pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items.

               Forrest pulls out a book titled "Curious George," then places 
               the feather inside the book. Forrest closes the suitcase.

               Something in his eyes reveals that Forrest may not be all 
               there.

               Forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard.

               A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus 
               continues on.

               A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at 
               the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a 
               magazine as Forrest looks at her.

                                     FORREST
                         Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.

               He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse.

                                     FORREST
                         You want a chocolate?

               The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this 
               strange man next to her.

                                     FORREST
                         I could eat about a million and a 
                         half of these. My momma always said, 
                         "Life was like a box of chocolates.
                         You never know what you're gonna 
                         get."

               Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's 
               shoes.

                                     FORREST
                         Those must be comfortable shoes. 
                         I'll bet you could walk all day in 
                         shoes like that and not feel a thing. 
                         I wish I had shoes like that.

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         My feet hurt.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma always says there's an awful 
                         lot you could tell about a person by 
                         their shoes. Where they're going.
                         Where they've been.

               The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his 
               own shoes.

                                     FORREST
                         I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I 
                         think about it real hard I could 
                         remember my first pair of shoes.

               Forrest closes his eyes tightly.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma said they'd take my anywhere.

               INT. COUNTRY DOCTOR'S OFFICE - GREENBOW, ALABAMA - DAY 
               (1951)

               A little boy closes his eyes tightly. It is young Forrest as 
               he sits in a doctor's office.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She said they was my magic shoes.

               Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg 
               braces.

                                     DOCTOR
                         All right, Forrest, you can open 
                         your eyes now. Let's take a little 
                         walk around.

               The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around 
               stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS. GUMP, watches him as he clanks 
               around the room awkwardly.

                                     DOCTOR
                         How do those feel? His legs are 
                         strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've 
                         ever seen. But his back is as crooked 
                         as a politician.

               Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump.

                                     DOCTOR
                         But we're gonna straighten him right 
                         up now, won't we, Forrest?

               A loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest!

               EXT. GREENBOW, ALABAMA

               Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street. Forrest 
               walks stiffly next to his mother.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, when I was a baby, Momma named 
                         me after the great Civil War hero, 
                         General Nathan Bedford Forrest...

               EXT. RURAL ALABAMA

               A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

               The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded 
               sheet over his head.

               The General is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse.

               The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan 
               members dressed in full uniform.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She said we was related to him in 
                         some way. And, what he did was, he 
                         started up this club called the Ku 
                         Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in 
                         their robes and their bedsheets and 
                         act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks 
                         or something. They'd even put 
                         bedsheets on their horses and ride 
                         around. And anyway, that's how I got 
                         my name. Forrest Gump.

               EXT. GREENBOW

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma said that the Forrest part was 
                         to remind me that sometimes we all 
                         do things that, well, just don't 
                         make no sense.

               Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. Forrest's 
               brace is caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and 
               tries to free Forrest. Two old cronies sit in front of a 
               barber shop and watch.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Just wait, let me get it.

               Mrs. Gump struggles to pull the stuck brace from the grate.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Let me get it. Wait, get it this 
                         way. Hold on.

               Forrest pulls his foot out of the grate.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         All right.

               Mrs. Gump helps Forrest up onto the sidewalk. She looks up 
               and notices the two old man.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Oooh. All right. What are you all 
                         staring at? Haven't you ever seen a 
                         little boy with braces on his legs 
                         before?

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two 
               old men. Mrs. Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Don't ever let anybody tell you 
                         they're better than you, Forrest. If 
                         God intended everybody to be the 
                         same, he'd have given us all braces 
                         on our legs.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma always had a way of explaining 
                         things so I could understand them.

               EXT. OAK ALLEY/THE GUMP BOARDING HOUSE

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a dirt road. A row of 
               mailboxes stands left.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We lived about a quarter mile of 
                         Route 17, about a half mile from the 
                         town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in 
                         the county of Greenbow. Our house 
                         had been in Momma's family since her 
                         grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come 
                         across the ocean about a thousand 
                         years ago. Something like that.

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the Gump Boarding House 
               driveway.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Since it was just me and Momma and 
                         we had all these empty rooms, Momma 
                         decided to let those rooms out. Mostly 
                         to people passing through. Like from, 
                         oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like 
                         that. That's how me and Mommy got 
                         money. Mommy was a real smart lady.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Remember what I told you, Forrest.
                         You're no different than anybody 
                         else is.

               Mrs. Gump heads Forrest to the porch. She bends down to look 
               Forrest in the eye.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Did you hear what I said, Forrest?
                         You're the same as everybody else. 
                         You are no different.

               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL / PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Your boy's... different, Mrs. Gump.
                         Now, his I.Q. is seventy-five.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Well, we're all different, Mr.
                         Hancock.

               The principal sighs, then stands up.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She wanted me to have the finest 
                         education, so she took me to the 
                         Greenbow County Central School. I 
                         met the principal and all.

               The principal stands in front of Mrs. Gump. Forrest, sitting 
               left, listens.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         I want to show you something, Mrs.
                         Gump. Now, this is normal.

               The principal holds up a chart with a designations according 
               to I.Q. and points to the center of the graph, labeled 
               "Normal." A red line below the normal area is labeled "State 
               Acceptance." The principal points to the section below the 
               acceptance line labeled "Below."

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Forrest is right here. The state 
                         requires a minimum I.Q. of eighty to 
                         attend public school, Mrs. Gump.
                         He's gonna have to go to a special 
                         school. Now, he'll be just fine.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         What does normal mean, anyway? He 
                         might be a bit on the slow side, but 
                         my boy Forrest is going to get the 
                         same opportunities as everyone else.
                         He's not going to some special school 
                         to learn to how to re-tread tires. 
                         We're talking about five little points 
                         here. There must be something can be 
                         done.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Forrest sits outside the principal's office.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         We're a progressive school system.
                         We don't want to see anybody left 
                         behind.

               INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         He's on vacation.

               EXT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest sits on a swing outside the house. Loud organic male 
               grunts are heard coming from inside the house. Forrest sits 
               on the swing as the grunts continue. The principal steps out 
               of the Gump House and wipes the sweat from his face.

               Forrest is sitting on the porch.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Well, your momma sure does care about 
                         your schooling, son. Mm-mm-mm.

               The principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back 
               at Forrest.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         You don't say much, do you?

               Forrest grunts, imitating him. The principal, embarrassed, 
               turns and walks away.

               INT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE/FORREST'S BEDROOM

               Mrs. Gump reads from the book "Curious George" as Forrest 
               sits on the bed and listens.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Finally, he had to try it. It looked 
                         easy, but, oh, what happened. First 
                         there...

                                     FORREST
                         Momma, what's vacation mean?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Vacation?

                                     FORREST
                         Where Daddy went?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Vacation's when you go somewhere, 
                         and you don't ever come back.

               Forrest lies down on his bed and looks up.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Anyway, I guess you could say me and 
                         Momma was on our own.

               EXT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               A cab driver closes the trunk of the car as two women walk 
               toward the house. A milkman steps down from the porch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But we didn't mind. Our house was 
                         never empty. There was always folks 
                         comin' and goin'.

                                     MRS. GUMP (V.O.)
                         Suppa.

               INT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE

               Mrs. Gump steps forward and speaks to all the boarders.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         It's suppa, everyone. Forrest...

               A MAN WITH A CANE steps left across the hall.

                                     MAN WITH CANE
                         My, my. That sure looks special.

               Mrs. Gump looks into a sitting room and informs the boarders 
               about dinner.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Gentlemen, would you care to join us 
                         for supper? Hurry up and get it before 
                         the flies do. I prefer you don't 
                         smoke that cigar so close to mealtime.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes we had so many people 
                         stayin' with us that every room was 
                         filled with travelers. You know, 
                         folks livin' out of their suitcases, 
                         and hat cases, and sample cases.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Well, you go ahead and start. I can't 
                         find Forrest.

               Mrs. Gump walks up the stairs.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest... Forrest...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         One time a young man was staying 
                         with us, and he had him a guitar 
                         case.

               Mrs. Gump looks into Forrest's room. She hears singing coming 
               from another room and walks over to a closed door. Mrs. Gump 
               opens the door, revealing a young man with long sideburns as 
               he plays the guitar and sings. Forrest holds onto a broom 
               and dances oddly. The young man is ELVIS PRESLEY.

                                     ELVIS PRESLEY
                              (sings)
                         "Well, you ain't never caught a 
                         rabbit, and you ain't no friend of 
                         mine."

               Forrest's legs rock back and forth to the guitar.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest! I told you not to bother 
                         this nice young man.

                                     ELVIS
                         Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I 
                         was just showin' him a thing or two 
                         on the guitar here.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         All right, but your supper's ready 
                         if y'all want to eat.

                                     ELVIS
                         Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, 
                         ma'am.

               Mrs. Gump leaves and closes the door. Elvis sits back down.

               Forrest stands left, and looks himself in a mirror.

                                     ELVIS
                         Say, man, show me that crazy little 
                         walk you just did there. Slow it 
                         down some.

               Forrest begins to dance again as Elvis plays the guitar and 
               sings.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "You ain't nothin' but a hound, hound 
                         dog..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I liked that guitar.

               Forrest dances as he watches himself in the mirror.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It sounded good.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "...cryin' all the time"

               Forrest rocks up and down on his braced legs, then begins to 
               step.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "You ain't nothin' but a hound dog..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I started moving around to the music, 
                         swinging my hips. This one night me 
                         and Momma...

               EXT. GREENBOW - NIGHT

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a sidewalk. A television 
               inside a store window reveals Elvis Presley as he performs 
               "Houng Dog" on a stage.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...was out shoppin', and we walked 
                         right by Benson's Furniture and 
                         Appliance store, and guess what.

               The television reveals Elvis as he thrusts his hips and sings.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest watch the television. Elvis dances 
               around in the same manner Forrest did. A woman in the audience 
               screaming and applauding.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         This is not children's eyes.

               Mrs. Gump walks away, pulling Forrest with her. Forrest stops 
               and takes one last look. Elvis continues to perform over the 
               television.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit 
                         and you ain't no friend of mine."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some years later, that handsome young 
                         man who they called "The King," well, 
                         he sung too many songs, had himself 
                         a heart attack or something.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY

               Forrest is still sitting on the bus bench. The black nurse 
               looks at him.

                                     FORREST
                         Must be hard being a king. You know, 
                         it's funny how you remember some 
                         things, but some things you can't.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/ALABAMA - MORNING (1954)

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest wait for the school bus. The bus pulls 
               up as Mrs. Gump prepares Forrest for his first day of school.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         You do your very best now, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         I sure will, Momma.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I remember the bus ride on the first 
                         day of school very well.

               The bus driver opens the door and looks down. Forrest walks 
               to the steps of the bus and looks at the bus driver. She is 
               smoking a cigarette.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         Are you comin' along?

                                     FORREST
                         Momma said not to be taking rides 
                         from strangers.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         This is the bus to school.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm Forrest Gump.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         I'm Dorothy Harris.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

               The bus driver smiles as Forrest steps up into the bus.

               INT. BUS

               Forrest steps up onto the bus. Mrs. Gump waves to Forrest as 
               the bus drives away. Forrest begins to walk down the aisle.

               TWO YOUNG BOYS look up from the seat.

                                     BOY #1
                         This seat's taken.

                                     BOY #2
                         It's taken!

               Forrest looks around. A larger girl slides over so Forrest 
               can't sit next to her. She shakes her head. Forrest looks to 
               the other side where a boy sits alone on a larger seat. They 
               boy glares up at Forrest.

                                     BOY #3
                         You can't sit here.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         You know, it's funny what a young 
                         man recollects. 'Cause I don't 
                         remember being born.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY

               Forrest continues talking as he sits on the bus bench.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I, I... don't recall what I got for 
                         my first Christmas and I don't know 
                         when I went on my first outdoor 
                         picnic. But, I do remember the first 
                         time I heard the sweetiest voice...

               INT. BUS - MORNING (1954)

               Young Forrest is still standing in the aisle on the bus.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...in the wide world.

                                     GIRL
                         You can sit here if you want.

               Forrest looks back at JENNY CURRAN, a young girl about 
               Forrest's age.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I had never seen anything so beautiful 
                         in my life. She was like an angel.

                                     JENNY
                         Well, are you gonna sit down, or 
                         aren't ya?

               Forrest sits down next to Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         What's wrong with your legs?

                                     FORREST
                         Um, nothing at all, thank you. My 
                         legs are just fine and dandy.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I just sat next to her on that bus 
                         and had conversation all the way to 
                         school.

                                     JENNY
                         Then why do you have those shoes on?

                                     FORREST
                         My momma said my back's crooked like 
                         a question mark. These are going to 
                         make me as straight as an arrow.
                         They're my magic shoes.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And next to Momma, no one ever talked 
                         to me or asked me questions.

                                     JENNY
                         Are you stupid or something.

                                     FORREST
                         Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.

               Jenny puts her hand out toward Forrest. Forrest reaches over 
               and shakes her hand.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm Jenny.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         From that day on, we was always 
                         together. Jenny and me was like peas 
                         and carrots.

               EXT. OAK TREE - DAY

               Young Jenny and Forrest run toward a large oak tree.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She taught me how to climb...

               Jenny sits on a large branch and calls down to Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

               Forrest dangles from the branch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...I showed her how to dangle.

               Jenny and Forrest sit on a tree branch and read.

                                     FORREST
                         "...a good little monkey and..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She helped me to learn how to read.

               Forrest hangs upside down from a branch and swings back and 
               forth. Forrest's braces are wedged in the tree.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And I showed her to swing.

               EXT. OAK TREE - NIGHT

               The silhouete of the oak tree, Jenny and Forrest as they sit 
               on a branch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait 
                         for the stars.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma's gonna worry about me.

               Jenny puts her hand on Forrest's hand.

                                     JENNY
                         Just stay a little longer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         For some reason, Jenny didn't never 
                         want to go home.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay, Jenny. I'll stay.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She was my most special friend.

               INT. SAVANNAH/BUS STOP - DAY

               Forrest nods as he remembers.

                                     FORREST
                         My only friend.

               Forrest continues talking to the black woman. She doesn't 
               seem to be listening as she reads her magazine. She looks up 
               from her magazine.

                                     FORREST
                         Now, my Momma always told me that 
                         miracles happen every day. Some people 
                         don't think so, but they do.

               EXT. OAK ALLEY - ANOTHER DAY (1954)

               Jenny and Forrest walk. A dirt clod hits Forrest in the back 
               of the head. Jenny looks as Forrest rubs his head. THREE 
               YOUNG BOYS get off their bikes and pick up more rocks.

                                     BOY #1
                         Hey... dummy!

               Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod. Forrest 
               falls backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him.

                                     BOY #2
                         Are you retarded, or just plain 
                         stupid?

                                     BOY #3
                         Look, I'm Forrest Gump.

               Jenny helps Forrest back up. Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more 
               dirt clods at Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Just run away, Forrest.

               Another dirt clod hits Forrest in the arm.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest tries to run along the road, but his braces makes it 
               impossible. He hobbles along as Jenny yells after him.

                                     JENNY
                         Run away! Hurry!

               Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes.

                                     BOY #2
                         Get the bikes!

                                     BOY #3
                         Hurry up!

               The boys pick up their bikes and ride after Forrest.

                                     BOY #3
                         Let's get him! Come on!

                                     BOY #2
                         Look out, dummy, here we come!

               The boys ride after Forrest. Jenny stands and watches.

                                     BOY #2
                         We're gonna get you!

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest! Run!

               Forrest hobbles along the dirt road.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest looks over his shoulder. The three boys race on their 
               bikes.

                                     BOY #1
                         Come back here, you!

               Forrest begins to run faster with his braces on. Forrest 
               continues running as the boys chase him. Blood drips down 
               from a cut on his head. The boys on the bikes are gaining on 
               Forrest. Forrest hobbles along. He begins to gain speed.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest! Run!

               SLOW MOTION --

               Forrest runs from the chasing room. He looks over his shoulder 
               in fear.

               The boys on the bikes peddle faster as they gain on Forrest, 
               running.

               Forrest tries to run even faster to get away. Suddenly his 
               braces shatter, sending steel and plastic flying into the 
               air.

               Forrest runs and look down at his legs in surprise.

               Forrest continues to run faster as the metal braces and straps 
               fly off his legs.

               Forrest runs free of his braces and begins to pick up speed.

               The chasing boys ride over the remains of Forrest's braces.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, you wouldn't believe it if I 
                         told you.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/ BUS BENCH - DAY

                                     FORREST
                         But I can run like the wind blows.

               The black woman continues to read her magazine. Forrest smiles 
               as he remembers.

                                     FORREST
                         From that day on, if I was going 
                         somewhere, I was running!

               EXT. OAK ALLEY - DAY (1954)

               Forrest sprints away from the boys. The boys stop the chase 
               and watch in disbelief. Forrest is already at the far end of 
               the road, clear of the chasing boys.

                                     BOY #2
                         He's gettin' away! Stop him!

               Boy #1 throws his bike down in frustration. Forrest runs 
               across a field.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD

               Forrest runs past a chain gang in their prison uniforms.

               They are cutting at the weeds on the side of the road.

               EXT. GREENBOW

               Forrest runs across the street. THE TWO OLD MEN sit in front 
               of the barber shop.

                                     OLD CRONY
                         That boy sure is a running fool.

               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE

               Forrest runs down a driveway toward Jenny's small house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now remember how I told you that 
                         Jenny never seemed to want to go 
                         home? Well, she lived in a house 
                         that was as old as Alabama. Her Momma 
                         had gone up to heaven when she was 
                         five and her daddy was some kind of 
                         a farmer.

               Forrest knocks on Jenny's door.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny? Jenny?

               Forrest look around the field at the left. He notices Jenny 
               and runs toward her.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He was a very lovin' man. He was 
                         always kissing and touchin' her and 
                         her sisters. And then this one time, 
                         Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to 
                         school.

               Forrest runs to Jenny.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny, why didn't you come to school 
                         today?

                                     JENNY
                         Hsh! Daddy's takin' a nap.

               Jenny grabs Forrest's hand and runs into the field. Jenny's 
               DAD drunk, steps out onto the porch and shouts.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny!

                                     JENNY
                         Come on!

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd 
                         better come back here, girl!

               Jenny's dad steps out toward the field. Jenny leads Forrest 
               into the thick tobacco field. Jenny's dad runs through the 
               field searching for Jenny with a liquor bottle in his hand.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Where you at?

               Jenny and Forrest run into a corn field as Jenny's dad tries 
               to chase her.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny!

               Jenny drops to her knees and pulls Forrest down with her.

                                     JENNY
                         Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny!

                                     JENNY
                         Dear God, make me a bird so I can 
                         fly far, far, far away from here.
                         Dear God, make me a bird so I can 
                         fly far, far, far away from here.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma always said that God is 
                         mysterious.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny! Get back here!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He didn't turn Jenny into a bird 
                         that day. Instead...

               EXT. TRAILER PARK/ALABAMA - DAY (1955)

               A police officer escorts Jenny to her grandmother's trailer.

               Jenny's grandmother meets Jenny outside and leads her toward 
               the trailer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...he had the police say Jenny didn't 
                         have to stay in that house no more.
                         She went to live with her grandma 
                         just over on Creekmore Avenue, which 
                         made me happy 'cause she was so close.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT (1955)

               Jenny climbs over a second-floor railing and enters the house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out and 
                         come over to my house, just 'cause 
                         she said she was scared. Scared of 
                         what, I don't know...

               INT. GUMP HOUSE/FORREST'S BEDROOM

               Jenny lies in bed next to young Forrest. She hugs him.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...but I think it was her grandma's 
                         dog. He was a mean dog. Anyway, Jenny 
                         and me was best friends...

               EXT. GREENBOW/OAK ALLEY - DAY (1961)

               Forrest and Jenny are teenagers now. They walk along an 
               oaklined road.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...all the way to high school.

               Suddenly Forrest is hit in the back with a rock. Forrest and 
               Jenny turn around.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Hey, stupid!

                                     JENNY
                         Quit it!

               A teenage boy throws another rock as a pickup truck pulls up 
               behind him. Jenny turns and looks at Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest, run!

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Hey. Did you hear me, stupid?

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest drops his books and runs down the road. The teenage 
               boy jumps into the back of the pickup truck with another boy 
               as the truck speeds after Forrest. Jenny steps left and gets 
               out of the way.

                                     OLDER BOY #2
                         Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest! Run!

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         You better be runnin', stupid.

               Forrest runs along the road. The truck speeds after him.

                                     OLDER BOY #2
                         Come on, dummy!

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Haul ass, dummy!

               Older Boy throws rocks at Forrest.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Yeah, you better be runnin'!

               INT. TRUCK

                                     BOY
                         Ya-hoo!

               EXT. OAK ALLEY

               The boys in the back of the truck throw rocks at Forrest as 
               they drive up to him.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Move it, jack rabbit!

               The truck follows right on Forrest's heels. A rebel flag 
               license plate adorns the truck's grill.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Come on!

               Forrest runs along the road as the truck chases him. The 
               boys in the back of the truck pound on the roof as the truck 
               turns right, after Forrest. The truck drives into a field.

               Forrest runs toward a fence.

                                     BOY
                         Run! Faster! Yeah! Go! Go! Come on, 
                         Forrest! Yeah!

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest leaps over a five-foot fence as the boys try to catch 
               him.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY (1981)

               Forrest looks left as he continues telling his life story.

                                     FORREST
                         Now, it used to be, I ran to get 
                         where I was goin'. I never thought 
                         it would take me anywhere.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/ROAD - DAY (1961)

               Forrest runs along the road in front of the high school. The 
               truck continues to chase him as the boys pound on the roof.

                                     OLDER BOY
                         Come on. Whoo-hoo!

               The truck speeds past Forrest as he turns from the road and 
               runs onto the high school football field. Forrest runs across 
               the field during a football scrimmage.

               In the stands watching the scrimmage is the legendary 
               University of Alabama football coach BEAR BRYANT, wearing 
               his trademark plaid hat.

               A group of assistant coaches sit around him, as well as the 
               high school football coach. The quarterback throws the ball 
               into the air.

               Forrest runs past the quarterback. The receiver catches the 
               ball. Forrest runs past the receiver as an opposing player 
               tackles the stunned receiver.

               The football coach stands, followed by the assistant coaches.

                         That there is Forrest Gump. Coach.
                         Just a local idiot.

               Forrest runs under the field goal post and through the end 
               zone.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And can you believe it? I got to go

               EXT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA STADIUM - DAY (1962)

               The crowd roars with excitement as a football is kicked off.

               The football players run around on the field. The crowd of 
               cheering fans create a huge sign that reads: "GO."

               Forrest is in a University of Alabama football uniform. He 
               looks up into the cheering crowd as his teammate fields the 
               kickoff. The teammate runs over to Forrest and hands him the 
               ball.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Okay! Run!

               The football coach, the assistants, and Alabama players cheer 
               for Forrest.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Run, you stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run!

               Forrest runs across the field. He speeds past the defending 
               players. Forrest runs past the opposite players. The crowd 
               cheers wildly, holding up cards, making a large sign that 
               reads: "Go."

               They turn the cards over, creating the word: "ALABAMA." The 
               football coach runs along the sidelines as he yells.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         You stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run! Go!
                         Run!

               Forrest cuts and runs toward the sidelines. Two opposing 
               players collide. The football coach, the assistants and the 
               players all motion for Forrest to run toward the end zone.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Run! Turn! Go!

               Forrest turns up the sidelines and runs toward the end zone.

               Some opposing players fall down. Forrest runs along the 
               sidelines. The opposing players try to catch him.

               Forrest runs into the end zone as an opposing player dives 
               at his feet. The referee holds up his arm, signaling a touch 
               down. The crowd cheers wildly.

               Forrest continues to run, smashing through the band members, 
               then all the way toward the team tunnel. The football coach 
               looks at an assistant coach.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         He must be the stupidest son-of-a-

                         Now, maybe it was just me but college 
                         was very confusing times.

               Forrest stands next to George Wallace and listens.

                         We must have no violence today, or 
                         any other day, because these National 
                         Guardsmen are here today as Federal 
                         Soldiers for Alabamans. And they 
                         live within our borders and they are 
                         all our brothers. We are winning in 
                         this fight because we are awakening

                         that we have spoken about so many 
                         times, just so evident today, the 
                         trend toward military dictatorship 
                         in this country.

               Some of the Alabama policeman and citizens clap their hands 
               as the National Guardsmen stand at attention with their 
               weapons in front of them. Forrest walks through the crowd.

               Two black students were being led toward the schoolhouse.

                         of Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been 
                         desegregated and students Jimmy Hood 
                         and Vivian Malone had been signed up 
                         for summer classes.

               The young black girl drops one of her books. Forrest notices 
               and steps past the policeman toward the book on the ground.

               Forrest steps out from the crowd and picks up the book. He 
               brings it up to the girl.

                                     FORREST

                         to do. By being on the Tuscaloosa 
                         campus, he kept the mob from gathering 
                         and prevented violence.

               An assistant coach looks at the television, then at the other

               Forrest steps up to the coaches' area and grabs a clean towel.

               The coaches turn and stare at Forrest. Forrest gives them 
               one of his silly waves, then walks away.

               A car pulls up. A song is heard from the radio. Forrest, 
               holding a box of chocolates, looks at the car. The two people 
               inside the car begins to kiss and embrace each other. Jenny

               Forrest gets up and runs toward the car. He tries to look in 
               the window as he steps over to the driver's side door. He 
               opens the door and begins to punch the boy inside. Jenny

               Jenny's date, named BILLY, gets out of the car angrily.

                                     BILLY
                         What the hell is going on here?

                                     JENNY
                         No, he's not!

                                     BILLY
                         Who is that? Who is that?

                                     JENNY
                         Get over there!

               Jenny turns and looks at Billy. He shoves Jenny's hands away 
               from him.

                                     JENNY
                         Billy, I'm sorry.

                                     BILLY
                         What in the hell, git, would you git 
                         away from me!

                                     JENNY
                         Don't... Wait a second!

                                     BILLY
                         Git, just git away from me!

                                     JENNY
                         Don't go! Billy, wait a second!

               Billy gets back into the car.

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't know any better!

               Billy pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, why'd you do that?

               Forrest holds out the box of chocolates.

                                     FORREST
                         I brought you some chocolates. I'm 
                         sorry. I'll go back to my college 
                         now.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come 
                         on.

               Jenny grabs Forrest hand and leads him toward the dorm.

               INT. JENNY'S DORM/HALLWAY

               Jenny and Forrest sneak to Jenny's door.

                                     FORREST
                         Is this your room?

                         Shh!

               Jenny unlocks the door and they step inside.

               INT. JENNY'S DORM ROOM

               Jenny pulls a robe off of her sleeping roommate's bed. Jenny 
               hands the robe to Forrest, sitting on Jenny's bed.

                                     JENNY
                         Do you ever dream, Forrest, about 
                         who you're gonna be?

                                     FORREST
                         Who I'm gonna be?

                                     JENNY
                         Yeah.

                                     FORREST
                         Aren't I going to be me?

                                     JENNY
                         Well, you'll always be you, just 
                         another kind of you. You know? I 
                         want to be famous.

               Jenny picks up a towel, then walks back toward Forrest. Jenny 
               dries the water from her hair.

                                     JENNY
                         I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.
                         I just want to be an empty stage 
                         with my guitar, my voice... just me.

               Jenny takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to him.

               She is only wearing her bra and panties. Forrest looks at 
               Jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before.

                                     JENNY
                         And I want to reach people on a 
                         personal level. I want to be able to 
                         say things, just one-to-one.

               Forrest looks down at Jenny's breasts. Jenny realizes that 
               he is looking at her.

                                     JENNY
                         Have you ever been with a girl, 
                         Forrest?

                                     FORREST
                         I sit next to them in my home 
                         economics class all the time.

                         Northern Alabama. I'm Joel Dorn...

               Forrest looks at Jenny as she removes her bra. Forrest looks 
               away, a bit shamed. Jenny takes his hand and guides it up to 
               her breast.

                                     DJ

                         cool sounds of WHHY.

               Forrest looks over at Jenny's breasts, the shudder as he has 
               an orgasm.

                                     FORREST
                         Ohh... Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.

                                     JENNY
                         It's okay.

               Forrest breathes heavily. Jenny puts her bra back on.

                                     JENNY
                         It's all right.

               Jenny leans over and puts her head on Forrest's shoulder.

                         Oh, I'm dizzy.

               A song is coming over the radio. Jenny hugs Forrest.

                                     JENNY

                         No.

               Jenny laughs and kisses Forrest on the cheek. Forrest and 
               Jenny hug on the bed as Jenny's roommate pretends to be 
               asleep, but is listening, horrified, with her eyes open.

               Forrest runs across the field as the defending team chases 
               him. The crowd yells for Forrest. They flip a sign that reads: 
               "Go Forrest."

               Forrest runs along the field. The crowd cheers.

                         Run! Run! Run!

               Forrest runs into the end zone. The band members rush toward 
               Forrest with their hands up, signaling him to stop. The crowd 
               flips over cards, creating a sign that reads "STOP."

                         Stop!

               Forrest stops in the end zone as he hears the crowd yells.

               The band motions for Forrest to stop and stay in the end

               zone. A group of defending players fall over each other in 
               the end zone. Forrest looks as the crowd cheers wildly.

               The All-American players mingle around the food table. Forrest 
               steps up to the table. A large spread of food and soda is on 
               the table.

                         the President of the United States 
                         is the food.

               Forrest takes a bottle of Dr. Pepper from the buffet table.

               Numerous bottle of Dr. Pepper are displayed on the table. A 
               servant opens the bottle for him.

                         one, I wasn't hungry, but thirsty...

               Forrest begins to guzzle the Dr. Pepper.

                         musta drank me about fifteen Dr. 
                         Peppers.

               Forrest sets down an empty Dr. Pepper bottle next to a large 
               number of other empty bottles. Forrest holds his stomach and 
               burps.

                         And a few years after that...

               ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - Robert Kennedy stands at a podium as people 
               around him applaud.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...somebody shot his little brother, 
                         too, only he was in a hotel kitchen.

               EXT. SAVANNHA/BUS BENCH - DAY (1981)

               Forrest sits on the bench and shakes his head.

                                     FORREST
                         It must be hard being brothers. I 
                         wouldn't know.

               EXT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA - DAY - GRADUATION DAY (1966)

               Students in their caps and gowns step forward the podium to 
               receive their diplomas. Forrest's name is called. He steps 
               up and accepts his diploma.

                                     DEAN
                         Forrest Gump.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now can you believe it? After only 
                         five years of playing football, I 
                         got a college degree.

               The dean shakes Forrest's hand vigorously. Forrest looks out 
               into the crowd.

                                     DEAN
                         Congratulations, son.

               Mrs. Gump, sitting in the audience, cries.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma was proud.

               Forrest and Mrs. Gump have their picure taken in front of a 
               large statue. A military recruiter spots Forrest and steps 
               up to him.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest, I'm so proud of you. Here, 
                         I'll hold this for you.

               Mrs. Gump takes the diploma from Forrest. The recruiter slaps 
               Forrest on the shoulder and hands him some military 
               literature.

                                     MILITARY RECRUITER
                         Congratulations, son. Have you given 
                         any thought to your future?

                         Thought?

               Forrest looks at a pamphlet with a photo of "Uncle Sam" and 
               the caption "EXCELLENT CAREERS FOR EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN. Apply 
               now at your local U.S. Army Recruiting Center."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Hello, I'm Forrest...

               INT. ARMY BUS - DAY (1966)

               Forrest steps onto the army bus. Rain pours outside as the 
               army bus driver yells at Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         ...Forrest Gump.

                                     ARMY BUS DRIVER
                         Nobody gives a hunk of shit who you 
                         are, fuzzball! You're not even a 
                         lowlife scum sucking maggot! Get 
                         your faggoty ass on the bus. You're 
                         in the Army now!

               Forrest is about to sit on the first available seat, but the 
               recruit sitting there refuses Forrest.

                                     RECRUIT #1
                         This seat's taken.

               Forrest tries to sit on the next seat, but the 2nd recruit 
               slides over, blocking him.

                                     RECRUIT #2
                         It's taken.

               Forrest steps forward, looking much like he did on his first 
               bus ride to school years ago.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         At first, it seemed like I made a 
                         mistake.

               A large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much 
               like Forrest's, looks up from his seat. His name is BUBBA.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...seeing how it was my induction 
                         day and I was already gettin' yelled 
                         at.

               Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit 
               down.

                                     BUBBA
                         You can sit down... if you want to.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I didn't know who I might meet or 
                         what they might ask.

               Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief.

                                     BUBBA
                         You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

                                     FORREST
                         No, but I been on a real big boat.

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm talkin' about a shrimp catchin' 
                         boat. I've been workin' on shrimp 
                         boats all my life. I started out my 
                         uncle's boat, that's my mother's 
                         brother, when I was about maybe nine.
                         I was just lookin' into buyin' a 
                         boat of my own and got drafted. My 
                         given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.

               Bubba and Forrest shake hands.

                                     BUBBA
                         People call me Bubba. Just like one 
                         of them redneck boys. Can you believe 
                         that?

                                     FORREST
                         My name's Forrest Gump. People call 
                         me Forrest Gump.

                         So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, 
                         Alabama, and his momma cooked shrimp.

               INT. LOUISIANA/KITCHEN - DAY (1966)

               Bubba's mother, a robust woman in a cook's uniform, carries 
               a bowl of shrimp into a dining room. She sets it down on a 
               table in front of a wealthy white man.

                         Okay.

               INT. BARRACKS - DAY

               A DRILL SERGEANT is in Forrest's face as Forrest stands in 
               line with the other recruits.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Gump! What's your sole purpose in 
                         this Army?

                                     FORREST
                         To do whatever you tell me, Drill 
                         Sergeant!

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Godamnit, Gump! You're a goddamned 
                         genius! That's the most outstanding 
                         answer I've ever heard. You must 
                         have a godamned I.Q. of a hundred 
                         and sixty! You are godamned gifted, 
                         Private Gump!

               The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Listen up, people...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, for some reason, I fit in the 
                         Army like one of them round pegs.
                         It's not really hard. You just make

                         That is one very intelligent 
                         individual! You lock your scuzzy 
                         bodies up behind that private and do 
                         exactly what he does and you will go 
                         far in this man's army!

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Is that clear?

                                     FORREST & RECRUITS
                         Yes, Drill Sergeant!

               ANOTHER DAY

               The recruits are sitting at the base of their bunks assembling 
               their rifles. Bubba speaks to Forrest.

                                     BUBBA
                         What you do is you just drag your 
                         nets across the bottom. On a good 
                         day, you can catch over a hundred 
                         pounds of shrimp. If everything goes 
                         all right, two men shrimpin' ten 
                         hours, less what you spends on gas, 
                         you can...

               Forrest finishes assembling his rifle as the other recruits 
               are still working on theirs.

                                     FORREST
                         Done, Drill Sergeant!

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Gump!

               The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Why did you put that weapon together 
                         so quickly, Gump?

                                     FORREST
                         You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

               The Drill Sergeant looks at his stop watch.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Jesus Christ! This is a new company 
                         record. If it wouldn't be a waste of 
                         such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd 
                         recommended you for O.C.S., Private 
                         Gump. You are gonna be a General 
                         some day, Gump! Now, disassemble 
                         your weapon and continue!

               The Drill Sergeant walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble 
               his rifle. After the Drill Sergeant walks past Bubba, Bubba 
               looks up at Forrest. Bubba continues talking about shrimp in 
               his slow southern drawl.

                                     BUBBA
                         Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is 
                         the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue 
                         it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute 
                         it. There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp 
                         creole...

               ANOTHER DAY

               Bubba and Forrest shine their boots.

                                     BUBBA
                         ...shrimp gumbo, panfried, deep fried, 
                         stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp, 
                         lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper 
                         shrimp...

               ANOTHER DAY

               Bubba and Forrest are on their hands and knees as they scrub 
               the floor with toothbrushes.

                                     BUBBA
                         ...shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp 
                         salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp 
                         burger, shrimp sandwich... that's, 
                         that's about it.

               NIGHT

               Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Nighttime in the Army is a lovely 
                         time.

               Forrest lies in his bunk and looks up.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We'd lay there in our bunks, and I'd 
                         miss my momma. And I'd miss Jenny.

               A young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest.

                         Hey, Gump. Get a load of the tits on 
                         her!

               Forrest pick up the magazine and turns the page, revealing 
               Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all.

               The pictorial is titled: "Girls of the South." Forrest looks 
               up with shock. He cranes his head up for a closer look.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Turns out, Jenny had gotten into 
                         some trouble over... some photos of 
                         her in her college sweater. And she 
                         was thrown out of school.

               INT. NASHVILLE/NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT (1966)

               Forrest, in his army uniform, steps into the foyer of the 
               club.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But that wasn't a bad thing. Because 
                         a man who owns a theater in Memphis, 
                         Tennessee, saw those photo and offered 
                         Jenny a job singing in a show. The 
                         first chance I got, I took the bus 
                         up to Memphis to see her perform in 
                         that show.

               EMCEE steps out onto the stage.

                                     EMCEE
                         That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give 
                         her a big hand, guys. Good job, Amber.

                         beatnik beauty, let's give a big 
                         round of applause to the luscious 
                         Bobbie Dylan.

                         Bobbie... Bobbie...

               The emcee walks back off the stage and the curtain opens, 
               revealing Jenny as she sits on a stool on the stage. She 
               holds a guitar up and begins to play. She is topless.

                                     JENNY

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Her dream had come true. She was a 
                         folk singer.

                                     JENNY

                         Hey, come on, baby. Shake it up.
                         Shake it up now.

                         Hey, somebody ought to get her a 
                         harmonica.

               The men laugh.

                         Yeah! Come on!

               Man #5 reaches up and tries to stick some money in Jenny's 
               shoe.

                                     MAN #5 :
                         Hey, honey, I got something here for 
                         you.

               Jenny kicks his hand. He yells angrily as he sits back down, 
               then tosses his drink on her.

                                     MAN #5
                         Goddamnit!

                         Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I'm singing a 
                         song here. Polly, get out here!

                         Shut up! Oh, shut up!

               Forrest walks up to Man #5 and grabs him and tosses him down 
               on the ground. Man #4 tries to grab Forrest, but Forrest 
               shoves him down too.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, what are you doing here? 
                         What are you doing?

               Forrest climbs up onto the stage and picks Jenny up, guitar 
               and all, and carries her.

                                     FORREST
                         Come on.

                         What are you doing? Forrest, let me 
                         down!

               Jenny struggles and frees herself from Forrest. Forrest steps 
               back in surprise. Jenny shoves the guitar at Forrest. Jenny 
               walks off as Forrest holds the guitar. He follows after her.

               EXT. MEMPHIS BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Forrest follows Jenny over a bridge outside the night club.

                                     JENNY
                         You can't keep doing this, Forrest.
                         You can't keep tryin' to rescue me 
                         all the time.

                         A lot of people try to grab me. Just --
                         you can't keep doing this all the

                         I can't help it. I love you.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, you don't know what love 
                         is.

               Jenny turns and looks over the bridge.

                                     JENNY
                         You remember that time we prayed, 
                         Forrest? We prayed for God to turn 
                         me into a bird so I could fly far, 
                         far away?

                                     FORREST
                         Yes, I do.

                                     JENNY
                         You think I can fly off this bridge?

                                     FORREST
                         What do you mean, Jenny?

                                     JENNY
                         Nothing.

               Jenny turns and looks at the light of an approaching vehicle.

               She steps into the street.

                                     JENNY
                         I gotta get outta here.

               Jenny runs and flags down the approaching vehicle.

                                     FORREST
                         But wait. Jenny!

                         Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
                         You just stay away from me, please.

               A pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver.

                                     JENNY
                         Can I have a ride?

                                     DRIVER
                         Where you going?

                                     JENNY
                         I don't care.

                                     DRIVER
                         Get in the truck.

                                     FORREST
                         So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin' me 
                         to Vietnam. It's this whole other 
                         country.

               Jenny walks toward Forrest. She looks at the driver.

                                     JENNY
                         Just hang on a minute.

               Jenny walks up to Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Listen, you promise me something, 
                         okay? Just if you're ever in trouble, 
                         don't try to be brave, you just run, 
                         okay? Just run away.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the 
                         time.

               Jenny takes a last look at Forrest, then climbs into the 
               truck. Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away.

                         And just like that.

               EXT. GREENBOW/GUMP BOARDING HOUSE/RIVER - DAY

               Forrest, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out 
               at a river.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...she was gone.

               Mrs. Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on 
               the log. Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's 
               shoulder.

                                     MRS. GUMP

               EXT. VIETNAM/MEKONG DELTA - MORNING (1967)

               The shadow of a helicopter over the rice field below. A 
               soldier is manning a gun from inside the helicopter. The 
               solider looks left, Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter.

               EXT. FIREBASE/4TH PLATOON

               The helicopter circles overhead, then lands at the firebase.

                         "Hail to the Chief," ohh, they point

               Bubba and Forrest jump out of the helicopter with their gear/ 
               They walk and look around oddly.

               The soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases.

               He takes two beers out and walks away. In the background, 
               soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer.

                         Where you boys from in the world?

                                     BUBBA & FORREST
                         Alabama, sir!

                                     LT. DAN
                         You twins?

               Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, they don't get 
               the joke.

                                     FORREST
                         No, we are not relations, sir.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Look, it's pretty basic here.

               Lt. Dan starts to walk. Bubba and Forrest grab their gear 
               and follow him.

                                     LT. DAN
                         You stick with me, you learn from 
                         the guys who been in country awhile, 
                         you'll be right. There is one item 
                         of G.I. gear that can be the 
                         difference between a live grunt and 
                         a dead grunt.

               Lt. Dan stops and looks at the boys.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Socks, cushion, sole, O.D. green. 
                         Try and keep your feet dry when we're 
                         out humpin'. I want you boys to 
                         remember to change your socks wherever 
                         we stop. The Mekong will eat a grunt's 
                         feet right off his legs.

               Lt. Dan steps over to a large black soldier named SERGEANT 
               SIMS.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Sergeant Sims! Goddamnit, where is 
                         that sling-rope I told you to order.

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         I put in requisitions at Battalion.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Yeah, yeah, yeah, well you call those 
                         sonabitches again, call them again 
                         and again and again. I don't care 
                         how much it takes...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Lt. Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt 
                         real lucky he was my lieutenant. He 
                         was from a long, great military 
                         tradition. Somebody in his family 
                         had fought and died in every single 
                         American war.

               EXT. VALLEY FORGE/THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR - DAY (1778)

               A distant relative of Lt. Dan's, wearing a revolutionary war 
               uniform, falls dead in the snow.

               EXT. GETTYSBURG/THE CIVIL WAR - DAY (1863)

               Another relative, wearing a civil war uniform and bearing a 
               striking resemblance to Lt. Dan, falls down dead.

               EXT. NORMANDY/WORLD WAR II - DAY (1944)

               Another relative, wearing a World War II, falls down dead on 
               the beach at Normandy.

               EXT. VETNAM/MEKONG DELTA/FIREBASE - DAY (1967)

                                     LT. DAN
                         Goddamnit, kick some ass!

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         I'm on it, Lieutenant.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Get on it!

               Lt. Dan steps back up to Bubba and Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I guess you could say he had a lot 
                         to live up to.

               Lt. Dan walks along the walkway and Bubba and Forrest follow.

                                     LT. DAN
                         So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
                         Well, I've been through there. Little 
                         Rock's a fine town. Now, go shake 
                         down your gear, see the platoon 
                         sergeant, draw what you need for the 
                         field.

               Lt. Dan steps inside the latrine, still holding the roll of 
               toilet paper.

                                     LT. DAN
                         If you boys are hungry, we got steaks 
                         burnin' right here.

               Lt. Dan sits down out of sight in the latrine, then stands 
               up, looking at the boys.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Two standing orders in this platoon.
                         One, take good care of your feet. 
                         Two, try not to do anything stupid, 
                         like gettin' yourself killed.

               Lt. Dan sits back down out of sight in the latrine. Bubba 
               and Forrest look at each other.

                                     FORREST
                         I sure hope I don't let him down.

               EXT. RICE FIELD - ANOTHER DAY

               Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon 
               walk across the rice field. Some Vietnamese rice farmers are 
               working as the soldiers walk past.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I got to see a lot of countryside. 
                         We would take these real long walks.

               EXT. JUNGLE/DIRT ROAD - ANOTHER DAY

               Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road.

                                     SONG
                         And we were always lookin' for this 
                         guy named Charlie. I can't get no 
                         relief.

               Suddenly Lt. Dan holds up his fist, a signal for the unit to 
               stop. He motions for them to get down.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Hold it up!

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         Hold up, boys!

               Forrest gets down and looks around.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It wasn't always fun. Lt. Dan always 
                         gettin' these funny feelings about a 
                         rock or a trail, or the road, so 
                         he'd tell you to get down, shut up!

                                     LT. DAN
                         Get down! Shut up!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So we did.

               Lt. Dan motions for the lead soldier to get down. Lt. Dan 
               crouches down. Lt. Dan looks at the soldiers and points to 
               his eyes. He lies down on the dirt road and crawls.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, I don't know much about anything, 
                         but I think some of American's best 
                         young men served in this war. There 
                         was Dallas, from Phoenix. Cleveland, 
                         he was from Detroit.

                                     CLEVELAND
                         Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex. Man, what the 
                         hell's going on?

               Tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And Tex was, well, I don't remember 
                         where Tex come from.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Ah, nothin'. Fourth Platoon, on your 
                         feet! Still got ten clicks to go to 
                         that river.

               Forrest stands up and begins to walk with the platoon.

                                     LT. DAN
                         All right, move out! Comin' out.
                         Look alive out there.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         The good thing about Vietnam is there 
                         was always someplace to go.

                                     LT. DAN (V.O.)
                         Fire in the hole!

               EXT. VIETNAM/VIET CONG FOXHOLE - ANOTHER DAY

               Lt. Dan walks away as Forrest rushes over, aims two pistols 
               in the hole, then climbs inside.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And there was always something to 
                         do.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Mount 'em up.

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         Spread out! Cover his back.

               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through a rice paddy, waits 
               deep in water. It begins to rain.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         One day it started raining, and it 
                         didn't quit for four months.

               EXT. JUNGLE

               The rain pours down on Forrest and Bubba as they sit in a 
               foxhole.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We been through every kind of rain 
                         there is. Little bitty stingin' 
                         rain...

               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through the jungle as rain 
               pours down on them.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...and big ol' fat rain.

               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon shelters themselves as they walk 
               through the wind and rain.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Rain that flew in sideways.

               ANOTHER DAY - Forrest and other soldiers walk chest-deep 
               through a river. The rain splatters back up from the river, 
               hitting the soldiers. Forrest holds his hand up to protect 
               his face.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And sometimes rain even seemed to 
                         come straight up from underneath.

               EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               The rain pours down on the men of the platoon as they sit in 
               a camp. Bubba sits down next to Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Shoot, it even rained at night.

               Bubba leans his back up against Forrest's back.

                                     BUBBA
                         Hey Forrest...

                                     FORREST
                         Hey Bubba...

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm gonna lean up against you, you 
                         just lean right back against me.

                                     BUBBA
                         This way, we don't have to sleep 
                         with our heads in the mud. You know 
                         why we a good partnership, Forrest?
                         'Cause we be watchin' out for one 
                         another. Like brothers and stuff. 
                         Hey, Forrest, there's somethin' I've 
                         been thinkin' about. I got a very 
                         important question to ask you. How 
                         would you like to go into the 
                         shrimpin' business with me?

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

                                     BUBBA
                         Man, I tell you what, I got it all 
                         figured out, too. So many pounds of 
                         shrimp to pay off the boat, so many 
                         pounds for gas, we can just live 
                         right on the boat. We ain't got to 
                         pay no rent. I'll be the captain; we 
                         can just work it together. Split 
                         everything right down the middle.
                         Man, I'm tellin' you, fifty-fifty. 
                         And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp 
                         you can get.

                                     FORREST
                         That's a fine idea.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Bubba did have a fine idea.

               ANOTHER NIGHT - Some soldiers patrol the area. Forrest lies 
               in a pup tent and writes a litter as the rain pours down. He 
               uses his flashlight to see.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I even wrote Jenny and told her all 
                         about it. I sent her letters. Not 
                         every day, but almost. I told her 
                         what I was doin' and asked her what 
                         she was doing, and I told her how I 
                         thought about her always.

               EXT. JENNY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY

               Jenny steps out of the trailer with a backpack and a guitar.

               She hugs a hippie guy, then jumps into the back of a 
               Volkswagen bus with another guy.

                         And how I was looking forward to 
                         getting a letter from her just as 
                         soon as she had the time I'd always 
                         let her know that I was okay.

               EXT. VIETNAM - NIGHT

               Forrest writes a letter in his tent.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Then I'd sign each letter, "Love, 
                         Forrest Gump."

               EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

               The Fourth Platoon makes their way through the jungle and 
               rain.

                         "There's something happenin' here.
                         What it is ain't exactly clear. 
                         There's a man with a gun over there, 
                         telling' me I got to beware."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         This one day, we was out walking, 
                         like always, and then, just like 
                         that, somebody turned off the rain 
                         and the sun come out.

               Forrest looks up as the sun suddenly appears. Forrest's 
               platoon is attacked. A bullet kills the soldier standing 
               next to Forrest. Bombs explode all around as the soldiers 
               scramble to the ground.

                         Take cover!

               Forrest crawls over a berm as bullets fly overhead and explode 
               all around him. Forrest rolls over and pulls his pack off 
               Lt. Dan lies next to Forrest.

               Two soldiers with a machine gun fire into the jungle. Lt. 
               Dan shouts into the radio. Forrest begins firing his weapon 
               into the jungle.

                         blue plus two. A.K's and rockets...

               The machine gunner fires into the treeline. Another soldier 
               helps him with the ammunition. The machine gun jams.

               A rocket explodes on the machine gunner and the other soldier, 
               killing them. Forrest looks down and covers his head as 
               rockets explodes all around him.

               Lt. Dan gets up and grabs Forrest by the collar.

               The platoon gets up and runs toward the cover of the jungle.

               Rockets explode all around the field. Forrest runs into the 
               jungle. The soldiers run through the jungle as bullets explode 
               all around. A soldier is blown up by a rocket. A soldier 
               runs through the jungle. Forrest runs past the soldier.

                         I ran and ran, just like Jenny told 
                         me to.

               Rockets explode in the jungle as Forrest runs out toward a 
               clearing.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I ran so far and so fast that pretty 
                         soon I was all by myself, which was 
                         a bad thing.

                         Bubba!

               Forrest turns around, then runs back into the jungle.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Bubba was my best good friend. I had 
                         to make sure he was okay.

               Rockets explode in the jungle. Forrest runs back into the 
               jungle to look for Bubba.

                                     1ST SOLDIER
                         Any friendlies out there?

                                     2ND SOLDIER
                         Yeah, I've got three over there.

                                     1ST SOLDIER
                         Where the hell are you?

               Forrest stops and aims his weapon. He looks around, scared.

                                     FORREST
                         Bubba?

               Something moves. Forrest turns and looks, then rushes over.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And on my way back to find Bubba, 
                         well, there was this boy laying on 
                         the ground.

                                     FORREST
                         Tex!

               Tex lies on the ground, his face distorted with pain.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

               Forrest reaches down and picks up Tex from the ground. Forrest 
               pulls Tex up over his shoulder, then runs.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I couldn't just let him lay there 
                         all alone, scared the way he was, so 
                         I grabbed him up and run him out of 
                         there.

               Forrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing.

               He sets Tex down on the bank of a river, and runs back into 
               the jungle.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And every time I went back looking 
                         for Bubba, somebody else was saying, 
                         "Help me, Forrest. Help me."

               Forrest drops another wounded soldier down at the bank of 
               the river next to Tex, and then runs back toward the jungle.

               Forrest grabs the third wounded soldier up from the ground 
               and turns him over. It is DALLAS.

                                     DALLAS
                         Can't hear... Can't hear...

               Dallas is dropped off at the bank next to the other wounded 
               soldiers. Forrest turns to go back to the jungle.

                                     2ND WOUNDED SOLDIER
                         No sweat, man. Just lay back. You're 
                         gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I started to get scared that I might 
                         never find Bubba.

               Forrest trips over something and falls to the ground. He 
               looks up to find two bloody legs. It is Lt. Dan, who is 
               wounded. He speaks into the radio.

                         this transmission? Over.

               Forrest tries to pick up Lt. Dan, who tries to push Forrest 
               away.

               Forrest pulls Lt. Dan over his shoulder and runs through the 
               jungle.

                         Then it felt like something just 
                         jumped up and bit me.

               Forrest falls down.

                         Ah, something bit me!

               Forrest gets up as Lt. Dan yells. Lt. Dan fires his pistol 
               at the unseen enemy as Forrest pulls him away.

                                     LT. DAN

               Forrest drops Lt. Dan down at the bank, next to the other 
               wounded soldiers. Lt. Dan grabs Forrest by the shirt, angry.

               Forrest gets up and runs as Lt. Dan yells after him.

                         I gotta find Bubba!

               Forrest runs through the jungle searching for Bubba. Forrest 
               slows down and looks around carefully.

                         I'm okay.

               Bubba holds a palm frond over his wound. Forrest removes the 
               frond to look at the wound. Bubba's chest has been blown 
               open.

                                     FORREST

               Forrest looks around as he hear the voices of the enemy.

                         Come on. Come on. Come here...

               Forrest carries Bubba through the jungle. The sound of 
               approaching planes fills the air.

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm okay, Forrest. I'm all right.

               The roar of approaching planes is deafening. Forrest looks 
               up in fear. Three planes dive down toward the jungle. They 
               fire napalm as the jungle explodes with massive fireballs.

               Forrest runs, carrying Bubba. The fireballs explode behind 
               him. The entire jungle area is in flames as Forrest runs.

               Forrest carries Bubba to the bank of the river. Lt. Dan and 
               the other wounded soldiers wait for a rescue helicopter.

                         talk, I'd a thought of something 
                         better to say.

               Forrest looks down at Bubba. A soldier releases a smoke 
               canister.

                         that money, 'cause I still ain't

               FLASHBACK - INT. US. ARMY HOSPITAL/VIETNAM - DAY

               Forrest holds two ice cream cones in his hands as he is 
               wheeled on a rolling stretcher.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...is the ice cream. They gave me 
                         all the ice cream I could eat. And 
                         guess what. A good friend of mine 
                         was in the bed right next door.

               Forrest, lying on his stomach, is wheeled to his bed.

               Forrest's butt sticks up and is bandaged. Forrest looks at 
               Lt. Dan lying on the bed. Forrest holds out an ice cream 
               cone for Lt. Dan.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice 
                         cream. Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

               Lt. Dan, annoyed, takes the ice cream cone and drops it into 
               his bed pan. Forrest slides himself onto his bed. A NURSE 
               reaches toward Lt. Dan.

                                     MALE NURSE
                         It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

               The male nurse places Lt. Dan's hands on a pull-up bar, then 
               picks up Lt. Dan, whose legs have been amputated.

               Another nurse wheels the rolling bed under Lt. Dan. The male 
               nurse sets Lt. Dan down on the rolling bed. Forrest looks up 
               at Lt. Dan as he is wheeled away. A soldier reads the names 
               from a pile of letters.

               The soldier hands Forrest a large pile of letters.

               "Undeliverable as addressed. No forwarding order on file."

               Jenny Curran Rural Route 2 Greenbow, Ala. 39902 Forrest looks 
               down at the pile of letters.

               INT. ARMY HOSPITAL/VIETNAM - DAY

               A group of wounded soldiers hang out in the hospital, 
               recuperating. Forrest sits and watches "Gomer Pyle" on the 
               television.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Gump, how can you watch that stupid 
                         shit? Turn it off!

                                     ANNOUNCER

                         Vietnam Network. This is Channel 6, 
                         Saigon.

               Forrest turns the TV off and he is hit on the back of the 
               head by a ping-pong ball.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Good catch, Gump. You know how to 
                         play this?

               Forrest shakes his head.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Come on, let me show you. Here.

               The wounded ping-pong player hands Forrest a paddle. Forrest 
               and the wounded ping-pong player step toward the ping-pong 
               table.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Now the secret to this game is, no 
                         matter what happens, never, never 
                         take your eye off the ball.

               He holds the ball up and moves it back and forth. Forrest 
               keeps his eyes on the ball.

                                     SOLDIER
                         All right...

               The wounded ping-pong player tosses the ball down onto the 
               table. Forrest begins to hit the ball back to the other 
               player.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         For some reason, ping pong came very 
                         natural to me.

                         So I started playing it all the time.

               Forrest hits ping-pong balls.

                         I played ping-pong even when I didn't

               The balls at land in a bed pan positioned on a chair. A group 
               of wounded soldier sit and watch Forrest play with himself. 
               Forrest hits two balls at a time against the opposite side 
               of the table.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         The hospital's people said it made 
                         me look like a duck in water, whatever 
                         that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would 
                         come and watch me play.

               Lt. Dan stares out the window. Forrest lies in his bed asleep. 
               A hand reaches and grabs him.

               Lt. Dan pulls Forrest to the floor, and holds Forrest down.

                         A legless freak. Look! Look! Look at 
                         me! Do you see that? Do you know 
                         what it's like not to be able to use 
                         your legs?

                         Did you hear what I said? You cheated 
                         me. I had a destiny. I was supposed 
                         to die in the field! With honor! 
                         That was my destiny! And you cheated 
                         me out of it! You understand what 
                         I'm saying, Gump? This wasn't supposed 
                         to happen. Not to me. I had a destiny. 
                         I was Lieutenant Dan Tyler.

               Lt. Dan looks at Forrest, lets go of Forrest and rolls.

               Lt. Dan sits up as Forrest looks at him.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Look at me. What am I gonna do now?

               Forrest immediately grabs the ball and places it down on the

               Forrest stops in mid-sentence as he looks down at the bed. A

               INT. BARBER SHOP

               The television revealing Forrest as he drops his pants, bends 
               over and shows the bullet wound on his bare buttocks.

               President Johnson looks down and smiles. The three men in 
               the barber shop look up in disbelief. Mrs. Gump looks up in 
               shock.

                                     PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                         Goddamn, son.

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - DAY

               Forrest walks by the Lincoln Memorial. A fence surrounds the 
               Memorial, as well as armed military guards.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         After that, Momma went to the hotel 
                         to lay down, so I went out for a 
                         walk to see our national capital.

                                     ISABEL
                         Hilary, all right, I've got the vets, 
                         what do you want me to do with them?

                                     HILARY
                         What are you doing here so late?

               Forrest takes a photo of the memorial as a woman named Hilary 
               gathers together some veterans against the Vietnam War.

                                     HILARY
                         We've been waiting for you for half 
                         an hour, so just get them in a line, 
                         will you. Hey, hey, come on, pictures 
                         later. You look great. Oh come on, 
                         get in this line, come on, come on 
                         right in line. Come on, let him here, 
                         let him in here.

               Hilary grabs Forrest and puts him in the line with the other 
               vets against the war.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It's a good thing Momma was resting, 
                         'cause the street was awful crowded 
                         with people looking at all the statues 
                         and monuments. And some of them people 
                         were loud and pushy.

               Hilary leads the line of vets toward the large anti-Vietnam 
               War rally.

                                     HILARY
                         Okay, follow me! Come on.

               The group of vets walk as Forrest tries to take another 
               picture. A vet behind him pushes him along.

                                     HILARY
                         Let's move it out.

                                     VET
                         Hey, buddy, come on. We could use 
                         your help.

               Forrest walks in the line. A banner reads "Veterans against 
               the War in Vietnam."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Everywhere I went, I had to stand in 
                         line.

                                     HILARY
                         Follow me, let's go!

               Hilary leads the vets through a crowd of people outside the 
               rally. Another woman, named Isabel, leads the vets toward 
               the back of a stage.

                                     ISABEL
                         All right, come on, guys.

                                     HILARY
                         Stand here.

                                     VET
                         Hey, you're a good man for doin' 
                         this. Good!

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

               A man, wearing an American flag shirt, stands on the stage.

               He is anti-war activist ABBIE HOFFMAN.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         We must declare to that fucking 
                         impostor in the White House -- 
                         Johnson. We ain't going to work on 
                         your farm no more! Yeah!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         There was this man, giving a little 
                         talk. And for some reason, he was 
                         wearing an American flag for a 
                         shirt...

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         Now, I'm going to bring up some 
                         soldiers that are going to talk about 
                         the war, man...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...and he liked to say the "F" word.
                         A lot. "F" this and "F" that. And 
                         every time...

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         ...that war has come home, and we 
                         have to stop these politicians...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...he said "F" word, people, for 
                         some reason, well, they'd cheer.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         ...these guys just told Lyndon Johnson 
                         where to stick this fucking war! 
                         Yeah!

               Forrest looks up at the cheering crowd. Abbie turns and 
               motions for Forrest to come up on the stage.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         Come on, man. Come up here, man.

                                     HILARY
                         Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!

               Hilary pulls Forrest up onto the stage.

                                     HILARY
                         Come on, get up there. Come on. Move, 
                         move. Let's go! Let's go.

               The other vets follow Forrest pushes onto the stage and push 
               him toward the microphones.

                                     VET
                         Come on, go. You can do it. Just get 
                         up there. Go on. That's it.

               Thousands of cheering protesters stand around the Washington 
               Monument. Forrest looks at the crowd. Abbie Hoffmann steps 
               up to Forrest.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         Tell us a little bit about the war, 
                         man.

                                     FORREST
                         The war in Vietnam?

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         The war in Viet-fucking-nam!

               Abbie raises his fist as the crowd cheers wildly.

                                     FORREST
                         Well...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         There was only one thing I could say 
                         about the war in Vietnam.

                                     FORREST
                         ...there was only one thing I could 
                         say about the war in Vietnam.

               Forrest looks at the crowd as he speaks. A policeman looks 
               around as he sneaks over to the audio circuit board.

                                     FORREST
                         In Vietnam war...

               The policeman pulls the patch cords out of the audio board.

               Forrest's amplified voice becomes inaudible. Forrest continues 
               to speak into the microphone, even though no one can hear 
               what he is saying. Hilary looks over and notices the 
               policeman. Hilary rushes over toward the audio board, pushes 
               the policeman away and grabs his night stick. Another 
               protester grabs the policeman and pulls him away.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Hey, what the hell are you doing?

                                     HILARY
                         I'll beat your head in, you goddamned 
                         oinker!

               Isabel, Hilary and another protester try to plug the tangled 
               mess of wires back into the audio board.

                                     ISABEL
                         Christ, what'd they do with this?

               Forrest continues to speak into the microphone. The crowd 
               grows restless.

                                     CROWD
                         We can't hear you! We can't hear 
                         anything!

                                     HILARY
                         This one! This one! Give me that!

               Hilary plugs in the right patch cord.

                                     HILARY
                         That's it.

                         ...and that's all I have to say about 
                         that.

               Forrest looks at the massive crowd. They are silent. Abbie 
               Hoffman steps over to Forrest and pats him on the shoulder.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         That's so right on, man. You said it 
                         all. What's your name, man?

                         Forrest Gump!

               Abbie raises his fist into the air. Abbie steps away from 
               Forrest. The crowd cheers.

                                     CROWD
                         Forrest Gump!

                                     JENNY
                              (screaming)
                         Forrest! Forrest!

               Jenny wades out into the reflection pool and waves her hand 
               into the air. Forrest recognizes her.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny!

               Forrest rushes off the stage as Jenny makes her way out into 
               the pool.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest!

               Forrest jumps down into the crowd and runs. Jenny smiles as 
               she tries to run through the water. The crowd parts as Forrest 
               runs into the pool. Jenny rushes toward him.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey! Hey!

               The massive crowd cheers for the embracing couple in the 
               pool.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It was the happiest moment of my 
                         life.

               EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT/PROTESTER'S ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               Forrest and Jenny walk past the protesters who are camping 
               out on the lawn.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Jenny and me were just peas and 
                         carrots again. She showed me around, 
                         and even introduced me...

               INT. BLACK PANTHER HEADQUARTERS/STOREFRONT, D.C. - NIGHT

               Forrest stands at an open window and looks at the White House.

                         ...to some of her new friends.

               A Black Panther, named RUBEN, steps over and pulls the shades 
               down.

                                     RUBEN
                         Shut that blind, man. And get your

                         Don't you know we in war here?

               Another Black Panther named MASAI grabs Forrest and pats him 
               down.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's

                         this is Wesley. Wesley and I live 
                         together in Berkeley, and he's the 
                         president of the Berkeley chapter of 
                         S.D.S.

                                     MASAI
                         Let me tell you something else.

                                     WESLEY
                         I want to talk to you.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay, but...

                                     WESLEY
                         No. Now! Goddammit!

                                     MASAI
                         We are here to offer protection and 
                         help for all of those who need our 
                         help, because we, the Black Panthers, 
                         are against the war in Vietnam. Yes, 
                         we are against any war where black 
                         soldiers are sent to the front line 
                         to die for a country that hates them.
                         Yes, we are against any war where 
                         black soldiers go to fight and come 
                         to be brutalized and killed in their 
                         own communities as they sleep in 
                         their beds at night. Yes, we are 
                         against all these racists and imperial 
                         dog acts.

                                     JENNY
                         You are a fucking asshole!

               Wesley hits Jenny across the face. Slow motion -- Jenny falls 
               back. Slow motion -- Forrest steps forward with rage.

               Slow motion -- Wesley turns and looks at Forrest. Forrest 
               tackles Wesley and slams him onto a table. Jenny turns and 
               looks as Masai pulls out a gun.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest!
                         Stop it!

               Jenny rushes over to Forrest and pulls Forrest off Wesley.

                                     JENNY
                         Stop it!

               Jenny tries to help Wesley as he moans on the floor. Wesley 
               knocks Jenny's hand away. He gets up, holding his bloody 
               lip.

                                     WESLEY
                         Oh, God. I shouldn't have brought 
                         you here. I should have known it was 
                         just gonna be some bullshit hassle.

                                     FORREST
                         He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on, Forrest.

               Jenny steps out the door as Forrest picks up his hat.

                                     FORREST
                         Sorry I had a fight in the middle of 
                         your Black Panther party.

               The group of Black Panthers glare at Forrest. Forrest turns 
               and walks out the room.

               EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

               Forrest and Jenny walk past the White House. Protesters hold 
               a candlelight vigil behind them.

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't mean it when he does things 
                         like this. He doesn't.

                                     FORREST
                         I would never hurt you, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         I wanted to be your boyfriend.

               They walk in silence. Jenny touches Forrest's uniform.

                                     JENNY
                         That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You 
                         look handsome in it. You do.

                                     FORREST
                         You know what?

                                     JENNY
                         What?

                                     FORREST
                         I'm glad we were here together in 
                         our national capitol.

                                     JENNY
                         Me too, Forrest. I have so much to 
                         tell you, you won't believe what's 
                         been going on...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We walked around all night, Jenny 
                         and me, just talkin'.

               EXT. ROUTE 66 - FLASHBACK - DAY

               Jenny stands in the rain, hitchhiking. A car pulls over to 
               pick her up. Jenny and other other girls get into the car.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She told me about all the travellin' 
                         she's done.

               EXT. COMMUNE IN NEW MEXICO - NIGHT

               A hippie gives Jenny a sugar cube of acid as they sit in 
               front of a roaring fire.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And how she'd discovered ways to 
                         expand her mind and learn how to 
                         live in harmony...

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD/WALK OF FAME - DAY

               A star with the name "Jean Harlow" on the sidewalk. Jenny 
               and two other girls sing on the sidewalk and collect change 
               from the passersby. Jenny plays the guitar.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...which must be out west somewhere, 
                         'cause she made it all the way to 
                         California.

                                     JENNY
                              (sings)
                         "Smile on your brother, everybody 
                         get together, try to love on another 
                         right now"

               A young hippie looks over his faded Volkswagen at the girls.

                                     YOUNG HIPPIE
                         Hey, anybody want to go to San 
                         Francisco?

                                     JENNY
                         I'll go.

                         Far out!

               EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAWN

               Forrest and Jenny walk through the park.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I was a very special night for the 
                         two of us. I didn't want it to end.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

               Jenny carries a backpack as she prepares to board a bus back 
               to Berkeley.

                                     FORREST
                         I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         I have to, Forrest.

                                     WESLEY
                         Jenny? Things got a little out of 
                         hand. It's just this war and that, 
                         that lyin' son-of-a-bitch Johnson. I 
                         would never hurt you. You know that.

                                     FORREST
                         You know what I think? I think you 
                         should go home to Greenbow. Alabama!

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, we have very different lives, 
                         you know.

               Forrest looks down at Jenny. He pulls his Medal of Honor 
               from around his neck.

                                     FORREST
                         I want you to have this.

               Forrest places the Medal of Honor in Jenny's hand. Jenny 
               looks up at him.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, I can't keep this.

                                     FORREST
                         I got it just by doing what you told 
                         me to do.

                                     JENNY
                         Why're you so good to me?

                                     FORREST
                         You're my girl.

                                     JENNY
                         I'll always be your girl.

               Jenny and Forrest hug each other. Wesley waits for Jenny.

               Jenny turns and walks up to Wesley. They walk toward the 
               entrance of the bus. Forrest smiles as Jenny looks at her.

               Jenny climbs up into the bus. Wesley glares at Forrest.

               Forrest gives Wesley the "evil eye." Jenny through the near 
               window of the bus, knocks on the window. Forrest turns and 
               looks. Jenny waves to Forrest. Forrest looks up and smiles 
               sadly. Jenny gives Forrest the peace sign as the bus pulls 
               away. The sign on the back of the bus reads "Berkeley to 
               D.C." Forrest gives Jenny the peace sign.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And just like that, she was gone out 
                         of my life again.

               INT. VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HOSPITAL/REC ROOM - DAY

               A footage of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon on 
               television.

                         That's one small step for man, one 
                         giant leap for mankind. The, uh, the 
                         surface is fine and powdery. I can, 
                         I can pick it up loosely.

               Forrest demonstrates a ping-pong to some wounded vets.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I thought I was going back to Vietnam, 
                         but instead, they decided the best 
                         way for me to fight communists was 
                         to play ping-pong. So I was in the 
                         Special Services, traveling around 
                         the country cheering up all them 
                         wounded veterans and showing them 
                         how to play...

               EXT. CHINA/PING-PONG TOURNAMENT - FLASHBACK - DAY

               Forrest plays ping-pong against a Chinese player. A large 
               mural of Mao Tse-tung hangs on the wall. A crowd of communist 
               leaders sit and watch.

                         the land of China in like a million 
                         years or something like that, and 
                         somebody said that world peace was 
                         in our hands. But all I did was play 
                         ping-pong. When I got home...

               Forrest makes his way onto the stage, shakes hands with Dick 
               Cavett.

                         Oh. Hard to imagine.

                                     JOHN LENNON
                         Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

               Forrest looks oddly at John Lennon.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some years later, that nice young 
                         man from England was on his way home 
                         to see his little boy and was signing 
                         some autographs. For no particular 
                         reason at all, somebody shot him.

               EXT. STUDIO - LATER

               A guard lets Forrest out a side entrance door. Forrest steps, 
               an then stops as he hears s man sitting in a wheelchair speak 
               to him.

                                     LT. DAN
                         They gave you the Congressional Medal 
                         of Honor.

                         Now that's Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant 
                         Dan!

               Forrest looks at Lt. Dan. He is a dirty with long hair.

                                     LT. DAN
                         They gave you the Congressional Medal

                         Yes sir, they sure did.

                         They gave you an imbecile, a moron 
                         who goes on television and makes a 
                         fool out himself in front of the 
                         whole damn country, the Congressional 
                         Medal of Honor.

                         Yes, sir.

                         Well, then, that's just perfect!
                         Yeah, well I just got one thing to 
                         say to that. Goddamn bless America.

               Lt. Dan's wheelchair begins to slide down the ramp and spins 
               around on the icy ground. Forrest looks down at Lt. Dan 
               crashes at the bottom of the ramp.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan!

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - NIGHT

               Taxi cabs crowd the street as Forrest pushes Lt. Dan along 
               the sidewalk.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Lieutenant Dan said he was living in 
                         a hotel. And because he didn't have 
                         no legs, he spent most of his time 
                         exercising his arms.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Take a right, take a right.

               A taxi driver honks his horn as Forrest wheels Lt. Dan out 
               in front of the taxi.

                                     TAXI DRIVER #1
                         Hey! Come on already!

                         What are you doing here in New York, 
                         Lieutenant Dan?

                                     LT. DAN
                         I'm living off the government tit.
                         Sucking it dry.

               A taxi skids to a stop, almost hitting them as they cross 
               the street. The taxi honks at Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan slaps the 
               bumper of the taxi.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind? I'm 
                         walking here! Ah, get out...

                         Why don't you go home before you 
                         kill yourself? Get out of the way!

                         I stayed with Lieutenant Dan and 
                         celebrated the holidays.

                         Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

                                     FORREST
                         I didn't know I was supposed to be 
                         looking for him, sir.

               Lt. Dan chuckles, drinks the rest of a bottle of wine and 
               tosses it down. He looks at Forrest. He wheels himself over 
               to television and turns it off.

                                     LT. DAN
                         That's all these cripples, down at 
                         the V.A., that's all they ever talk 
                         about.

               Lt. Dan picks up another bottle of port wine, but it is empty. 
               He tosses it onto the floor.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Jesus this and Jesus that. Have I 
                         found Jesus? They even had a priest 
                         come and talk to me. He said God is 
                         listening, but I have to help myself.
                         Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart, 
                         I'll get to walk beside him in the 
                         Kingdom of Heaven.

               Lt. Dan tosses the empty liquor bottle down and picks another 
               bottle. He becomes enraged as he throws the bottle and looks 
               at Forrest.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Did you hear what I said? Walk beside 
                         him in the Kingdom of Heaven. Well, 
                         kiss my crippled ass. God is 
                         listening. What a crock of shit.

                         I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

                         Huh? Ah, well, before you go, why 
                         don't you get your ass down to the 
                         corner and get us another bottle of 
                         wine.

                         This is the site of the old Astor 
                         Hotel. Down below us, well over a 
                         hundred thousand people are milling 
                         about, cheering with horns and

                         I made me a promise to Bubba in

                         over, we'd go in partners. He'd be

               Two sleazy women, named LENORE and CARLA, walk up to Lt.

               Jenny fills her bag with her belongings.

                         Wondering how she was spending her 
                         New Year's night out in California.

               A man lies passed out on the bed. Jenny looks at her black 
               eye in a mirror, then leaves the apartment. The TV shows the 
               ball in Times Square.

               The ball is lowered, lighting up a sign that reads "1972."

               The people in the bar cheer and kiss each other. They blow 
               horns and toss confetti into the air. Forrest looks around 
               as Carla and Lenore lean over and kiss him.

               INT. LT. DAN'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

               Carla removes her top and sits on top of Dan in his 
               wheelchair. They kiss and play around. Forrest sits in a 
               chair. Lenore leaps on him and begins to kiss Forrest. She 
               reaches down to Forrest's crotch. Forrest stands up nervously, 
               causing Lenore to fall down on the floor. Lenore stands up, 
               angry.

                                     LENORE
                         What are you, stupid or something?
                         What's your problem? What's his 
                         problem? Did you lose your pecker in 
                         the war or something?

                                     CARLA
                         What, is your friend stupid or 
                         something?

                                     LT. DAN
                         What did you say?

                                     CARLA
                         I said, is your friend stupid or 
                         something?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Hey! Don't call him stupid!

               Lt. Dan throws Carla back onto the bed.

                                     CARLA
                         Don't push me like that!

                                     LENORE
                         Hey, don't you push her!

                                     LT. DAN
                         You shut up! Don't you ever call him 
                         stupid!

                                     CARLA
                         What's the matter, baby? Why you 
                         treating me like shit?

                         You should be in a side show!

                                     LT. DAN
                         Go on! Get out of here! Get out of 
                         here!

                                     LENORE

                                     CARLA
                         Come on, Lenore. We don't need this 
                         shit!

                                     LENORE
                         You're so pathetic.

                         Get out of here!

               Lt. Dan falls out of his wheelchair and lands down on the 
               floor. Carla and Lenore laugh as they leave the apartment.

                                     CARLA
                         You retard!

                                     LENORE
                         You loser! You freak!

               Forrest tries to help Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan pushes Forrest away.

                                     LT. DAN
                         No!

               Forrest steps back as Lt. Dan flips back over, then pulls 
               himself back up onto his wheelchair. He breathes heavily.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's 
                         Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tastes 
                         like cigarettes.

                         I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's 
                         some things you just can't change. 
                         He didn't want to be called crippled, 
                         just like I didn't want to be called 
                         stupid.

                         Happy New Year.

               EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

               An ANCHORMAN reports in front of the White House.

                         The U.S. Ping-Pong Team met with

               PRESENT - BUS STOP

               Forrest looks at the fat man on the bus bench.

                                     FORREST
                         ...a few months later they invited 
                         me and the ping-pong team to visit 
                         the White House. So I went again.
                         And I met the President of the United 
                         States again.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

               A plaque, presented to Forrest, reads "Presented to Forrest 
               Gump, member of the United States table tennis team as player 
               of the year for 1971. President NIXON holds the plaque.

                                     PRESIDENT NIXON
                         So are you enjoying yourself in our

                         It's called the Hotel Ebbott.

                                     PRESIDENT NIXON
                         Oh, no, no, no, no. I know of a much 
                         nicer hotel. It's brand-new. Very 
                         modern. I'll have my people take 
                         care of it for you.

               INT. WATERGATE HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Forrest speaks on the phone.

                         Security, Frank Wills.

               Forrest steps over to a window. Flashlights are moving around 
               in an office across from Forrest's room.

                                     FORREST
                         Yeah, sir, you might want to send a

                         across the way. The lights are off, 
                         and they must be looking for the

                         Good night.

               Forrest hangs up the phone. The camera tilts down, revealing 
               the hotel stationary, which reads "The Watergate Hotel."

               INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

               President Nixon makes a resignation speech on TV.

                                     PRESIDENT NIXON
                              (over television)
                         Therefore, I shall resign the 
                         Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.

               The television cuts to a shot of President Nixon standing 
               outside Air Force One with his hands in the peace sign.

                                     PRESIDENT NIXON
                              (over television)
                         Vice President Ford will be sworn in 
                         as President at that hour in this 
                         office. As I recall the high hopes 
                         for America with which we began this 
                         second term, I feel a great sadness 
                         that I will not be here in this 
                         office...

               Forrest is playing ping-pong by himself at the gymnasium. An 
               officer steps up to him.

                                     OFFICER
                         Sergeant Gump!

                         Yes, sir!

                         As you were. I have your discharge 
                         papers. Your service is up, son.

               The officer hands Forrest an envelope, then walks away.

                         Does this mean I can't play ping 
                         pong no more?

                                     OFFICER
                         For the Army it does.

                         And just like that, my service in 
                         the United States Army was over. So 
                         I went home.

               Forrest takes his paddle and runs out of the gymnasium.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Mrs. Gump walks out of the house and smiles. Forrest walks 
               up to the house, wearing his uniform.

                         I'm home, Momma.

                         I know, I know.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk into the house.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Louise, he's here. He's here, 
                         everybody.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, when I got home, I had no idea 
                         that Momma had had all sorts of 
                         visitors.

               In the house are stacks of ping-pong paddles and life-sized 
               cardboard cutouts of Forrest playing ping-pong. The name on 
               the ping-pong paddles boxes reads: "Gump-Mao table tennis."

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         We've had all sorts of visitors, 
                         Forrest. Everybody wants you to use 
                         their ping-pong stuff. One man even 
                         left a check for twenty-five thousand 
                         dollars if you'd be agreeable to 
                         saying you like using their paddle.

                                     FORREST
                         Oh, Momma. I only like using my own 
                         paddle. Hi, Miss Louise.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hey, Forrest.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         I know that. I know that. But it's 
                         twenty-five thousand dollars, Forrest.
                         I thought maybe you could hold it 
                         for a while, see if it grows on you. 
                         Oh, you look good, Forrest. You look 
                         real good.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         That Momma, she sure was right. It's 
                         funny how things work out.

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE/BUBBA'S MOM'S HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest walks up to a shack on the edge of the Bayou. A group 
               of black kids play in the front yard.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I didn't stay home for long, because 
                         I'd made a promise to Bubba. And I 
                         always try to keep my promise. So I 
                         went on down to Bayou La Batre to 
                         meet Bubba's family and make their 
                         introduction.

               Bubba's mother named MRS. BLUE and her other children look 
               at Forrest.

                                     MRS. BLUE
                         Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

                                     FORREST
                         Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

                                     MRS. BLUE
                         I guess.

               EXT. BUBBA'S GRAVE - DAY

               Forrest steps over to Bubba's tombstone.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And of course, I paid my respect to 
                         Bubba himself.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump. I 
                         remember everything you said, and I 
                         got it all figured out.

               Forrest pulls out notes from his pocket.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm taking the twenty-four thousand, 
                         five hundred and six-two dollars and 
                         forty-seven cents that I got...

               EXT. BAYOU - DAY

               Forrest walks across a yard where men are cleaning shrimp.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...well, that's left after a new 
                         hair cut and a new suit and I took 
                         Momma out to real fancy dinner and I 
                         bought a bus ticket and three Doctor 
                         Peppers.

               Forrest walks along a wooden pier. Forrest pays an old black 
               shrimper a large wad of cash.

                                     OLD SHRIMPER
                         Tell me something. Are you stupid or 
                         something?

                                     FORREST
                         Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

               EXT. BUBBA'S GRAVE

               Forrest stands at the grave.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, that's what's left after me 
                         saying, "When I was in China on the 
                         All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just
                         loved playing ping-pong with my Flex-
                         O-Ping-Pong Paddle." Which everybody 
                         knows it isn't true, but Momma says 
                         it's just a little white lie so it 
                         wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway, 
                         I'm putting all that on gas, ropes 
                         and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' 
                         boat.

               EXT. BAYOU - DAY

               Forrest steers his shrimping boat. The boat is old and rusty.

               Forrest unleashes his nets as his catch of the day drops to 
               the deck. It is a bunch of garbage and shells. Forrest picks 
               up one shrimp.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, Bubba had told me everything he 
                         knows about shrimpin', but you know 
                         what I found out? Shrimpin' is tough.

               EXT. DOCKS

               Forrest pulls a couple of shrimp out of a bucket.

                                     FORREST
                         I only caught five.

                                     OLD SHRIMPER
                         A couple of more, you can have 
                         yourself a cocktail.

               The old shrimper begins to walk away, then stops and looks 
               at Forrest.

                                     OLD SHRIMPER
                         Hey, you ever think about namin' 
                         this old boat?

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I'd never named a boat before, but 
                         there was only one I could think of.

               Forrest paints a name on the side of his boat. The name is 
               "Jenny."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         The most beautiful name in the wide 
                         world.

               INT. DISCO

               Disco lights flash and people dance. A guy asks a girl to 
               dance.

                                     GIRL
                         Okay.

               Jenny sits at a table with some other people. She is snorting 
               cocaine.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny in a 
                         long while. But...

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE - DAY

               Forrest stands at the helm as the boat glides across the 
               water.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But I thought about her a lot. And I 
                         hoped that whatever she was doing 
                         made her happy.

               INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Drug paraphernalia and a large wad of cash are spread out on 
               a table. A man drops a syringe on the table. He reaches over 
               and touches Jenny. She is pale with dark lines under her 
               eyes.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Jenny smears some lines of cocaine on a mirror. She looks at 
               herself in the mirror.

               EXT. BALCONY

               Jenny steps out onto the high-rise balcony. She steps up on 
               a table and stands on the edge of the balcony. A busy street 
               lies many stories below. Jenny looks down to the intersection 
               below.

               She slips over the edge, regains her balance, turns and looks 
               back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from 
               the edge.

               Jenny grabs a hold of the ledge and carefully climbs down.

               She sits down on a chair. Jenny rocks back and forth as she 
               cries. She looks up at the sky.

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE/FORREST'S BOAT - NIGHT

               The moon shines above in the sky. Forrest lies in a hammock 
               on his boat.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I thought about Jenny all the time.

               EXT. FORREST'S BOAT/BAYOU DOCK - DAY

               Forrest stands at the helm of his boat and slowly glides by 
               the docks. Forrest looks around and notices something and 
               bends down to get a clear view. Lt. Dan sits in his wheelchair 
               on the deck. Forrest looks at Lt. Dan. He smiles, surprised.

                                     FORREST
                         Hi!

               Forrest leaps off of his moving boat and into the water. The 
               boat continues as Forrest clumsily swims. Lt. Dan sits in 
               his wheelchair at the edge of the dock. Forrest flails his 
               arms as he swims up to the dock. Lt. Dan waits for Forrest, 
               smoking a cigar. Forrest climbs up a ladder onto the dock.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing 
                         here?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Well, I thought I'd try out my sea 
                         legs.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, you ain't got no legs, 
                         Lieutenant Dan.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Well, well, Captain Forrest Gump. I 
                         had to see this for myself. And I 
                         told you if you were ever a shrimp 
                         boat captain, that I'd be your first 
                         mate. Well, here I am. I am a man of 
                         my word.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

               Forrest shakes Lt. Dan's hand.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Yeah, but don't you be thinking that 
                         I'm gonna be calling you sir.

                                     FORREST
                         No, sir.

               Forrest's boat glides, crushing a dock. Forrest and Lt. Dan 
               look at it.

                                     FORREST
                         That's my boat.

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE WATERS - DAY

               Forrest's shrimping boat is alone on the gulf waters.

                                     LT. DAN
                         I have a feeling if we head the east, 
                         we'll find some shrimp. So, take a 
                         left. Take a left.

               Forrest looks up. Lt. Dan is sitting in the rigging.

                                     FORREST
                         Which way?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Over there! They're over there! Get, 
                         get on the wheel and take a left!

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Gump, what are you doing? Take a 
                         left! Left! That's where we're gonna 
                         find those shrimp, my boy! That's 
                         where we'll find 'em.

               Forrest empties the net. Their "catch" is debris that falls 
               to the deck.

                                     FORREST
                         Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Okay, so I was wrong.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, how we gonna find them?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Well, maybe you should just pray for 
                         shrimp.

               INT. SMALL CHURCH - DAY

               The all-black gospel choir sings and claps their hands.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So I went to church every Sunday...

               Lt. Dan is sitting in his chair at the back of the church. 
               He takes swigs from a liquor bottle.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too.
                         Though I think he left the praying 
                         up to me.

               EXT. BOAT - ANOTHER DAY

               A catch of junk is dumped onto the deck. Lt. Dan lowers 
               himself from the rigging.

                                     FORREST
                         No shrimp.

                         Where the hell's this God of yours?

               The wind begins to blow strong.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that, 
                         'cause right then, God showed up.

               EXT. BOAT - NIGHT

               Water sprays on deck during a hurricane. Lt. Dan on the 
               rigging, shouts and shakes his fist as he is pelted by wind 
               and rain.

                                     LT. DAN
                         You'll never sink this boat!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now me, I was scared. But Lieutenant 
                         Dan, he was mad.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Come on! You call this a storm?

               Forrest slides back and forth as he attempts to steer the 
               boat.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Blow, you son-of-a-bitch! Blow! It's 
                         time for a showdown! You and me. I'm 
                         right here. Come and get me! You'll

                         shrimping boat actually survived the 
                         storm.

               Forrest's boat comes down the river.

               Lt. Dan and Forrest empty their net. A huge catch of shrimp 
               falls onto the deck. Lt. Dan opens another big catch.

               Another catch drops open on top of yet another huge catch.

               Forrest and Lt. Dan smile.

                         Forrest, I never thanked you for 
                         saving my life.

               Forrest looks a little surprised. Lt. Dan smiles, then looks 
               away. Lt. Dan pulls himself out of his chair to the railing 
               and jumps into the water.

                         He never actually said so, but I

               EXT. BOAT

               Forrest and Lt. Dan have dinner on the deck. The television

               Forrest rides the mower.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And 'cause I was godzillionaire and 
                         I liked doing it so much. I cut that 
                         grass for free.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE BALCONY - NIGHT

               Forrest looks down the road as he steps onto the porch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But at nighttime, when there was 
                         nothing to do and the house was all 
                         empty, I'd always think of Jenny.

               Jenny's image walks, then vanishes. Forrest looks away. He 
               turns and walks into the house.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Jenny walks across the lawn to Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And then, she was there.

                                     JENNY
                         Hello, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Hello, Jenny.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Jenny came back and stayed with me.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE

               Jenny lies asleep in bed.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Maybe it was because she had nowhere 
                         else to go. Or maybe it was because 
                         she was so tired, because she went 
                         to bed and slept and slept like she 
                         hadn't slept in years. It was 
                         wonderful having her home.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Forrest and Jenny walking.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd 
                         jabber on like a monkey in a tree.
                         And she'd listen about ping-pong and 
                         shrimpin' boats and Momma makin' a 
                         trip to heaven. I did all the talkin'. 
                         Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

                                     FORREST
                         ...big ol' gobs of rain and little 
                         bitty stinging rain and rain...

               Jenny's old house stands at the end of the dirt road. It 
               appears to be deserted. Jenny walks toward the house and 
               stops. She stares at the house. Forrest walks toward Jenny.

               Jenny suddenly heaves a rock angrily at the house. She throws 
               other things at the house.

                                     JENNY
                         How could you do this?

               She breaks a window. Jenny collapses to the ground and sobs.

               Forrest knees down next to her.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes I guess there just aren't 
                         enough rocks.

               EXT. OLD OAK TREE - DAY

               Jenny and Forrest sit on a limb together.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I never really knew why she came 
                         back, but I didn't care. It was like 
                         olden times. We was like peas and 
                         carrots again.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Jenny sits by the vase of flowers and look out the window.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Every day I'd pick pretty flowers 
                         and put them in her room for her.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest closes his eyes as he sits on the porch. Jenny places 
               a box of Nike running shoes in his lap.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And she gave me the best gift anyone 
                         could ever get in the wide world.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay, you can open your eyes.

                                     FORREST
                         New shoes.

                                     JENNY
                         They make them just for running.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Through the windows, Forrest and Jenny are dancing as it 
               rains outside.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And she even showed me how to dance.
                         And, well, we was like family... 
                         Jenny and me.

               EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

               Jenny and Forrest sit on a log together and look at the river.

               Jenny places her arms around Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And it was the happiest time of my 
                         life.

               The fireworks explode in the sky.

               INT. GUMP'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Statue of Liberty is shown on the TV. Fireworks go off.

               Forrest and Jenny are watching the 4th of July celebration 
               on TV.

                                     JENNY
                         You done watching it?

                                     FORREST
                         Mm-hmm.

                         earlier, the Statue of Liberty...

               Jenny stands up and kisses Forrest on the cheek.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm going to bed.

               Jenny turns off the TV and walks outside. Forrest stands as 
               he puts down his Dr. Pepper. Jenny walks toward the stairs.

                                     FORREST
                         Will you marry me? I'd make a good 
                         husband, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         You would, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         But you won't marry me.

                                     JENNY
                         You don't want to marry me.

                                     FORREST
                         Why don't you love me, Jenny? I'm 
                         not a smart man, but I know what 
                         love is.

               Forrest turns and walks toward the door. Jenny turns and 
               walks up the stairs. Forrest stands outside.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               The house stands in the rain.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest lies in his bed as the door opens. Jenny gets into 
               bed next to Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny?

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, I do love you.

               Jenny and Forrest kiss. Jenny takes off her nightgown as 
               they make love.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING

               Jenny carries her purse and walks toward a waiting cab.

                                     CAB DRIVER
                         Where are you running off to?

                                     JENNY
                         I'm not running.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE

               The cab drives away as Forrest is asleep in his bed. The 
               Congressional Medal lies on a table by a ping-pong paddle.

               Forrest holds a glass of milk and wears his bathrobe. He 
               looks at the medal he had give to Jenny. Jenny's bed is made. 
               Forrest stands in the doorway looking at the room and bed 
               where Jenny had been.

               EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

               Forrest sit on a rocking chair with his running shoes on. He 
               is still, as if in a trance. He slowly puts on his Bubba-
               Gump cap. Forrest stands. He walks off the porch. He begins 
               to jog across the lawn. His speed increases as he runs farther 
               away. Forrest runs down the drive away from his house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         That day, for no particular reason, 
                         I decided to go for a little run.

               Forrest runs to the end of the drive, then turns right and 
               runs down the highway.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So I ran to the end of the road, and 
                         when I got there, I thought maybe 
                         I'd run to the end of town.

               INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

               The three men sit as they watch the television. Forrest runs 
               through the main street of town.

               The sign reads "Entering Greenbow County."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)

                         across the great...

               Forrest runs by a sign that reads "Mississippi welcomes you. 
               The Magnolia State."

                         For no particular reason, I just 
                         kept on going. I ran clear to the 
                         ocean.

               EXT. SANTA MONICA - DAY

               The sign reads "Santa Monica yacht harbor sports fishing - 
               boating - cafes." Forrest runs under the sign and onto the 
               pier.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And when I got there, I figured since 
                         I'd gone this far, I might as well 
                         turn around, just keep on going.

               EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN

               Forrest runs to a pier at the Atlantic Ocean.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         When I got to another ocean, I figured

                         well just turn back, keep right on 
                         going.

               Forrest runs across the pier. A lighthouse stands at the end 
               of the pier.

                         Yeah.

               EXT. HIGHWAY

               Forrest is running along the highway. Forrest runs down a 
               road between field of wheat. A Mountain river. Forrest runs 
               across a cobble-stone bridge. The Rocky Mountains are behind 
               him in distance. Forrest runs through some meadowland.

               Split rail fences line the road.

                         I'd think a lot about Momma and Bubba, 
                         and Lieutenant Dan, but most of all, 
                         I thought about Jenny. I thought 
                         about her a lot.

                         across America, Forrest Gump, a 
                         gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, is 
                         about to cross the Mississippi River 
                         again today.

               The TV shows Forrest runs across a bridge that reads 
               "Mississippi River."

                         Now, for some reason what I was doing 
                         seemed to make sense to people.

               The young man jobs behind Forrest.

                         I mean, it was like an alarm went 
                         off in my head, you know. I said, 
                         here's a guy that's got his act 
                         together. Here's somebody who's got 
                         it, all figured out. Here's somebody 
                         who has the answer. I'll follow you

                         So, I got company.

               Forrest runs up a slope on a high mountain road. A group of 
               people are jogging behind him.

               A large group jogs behind Forrest across the desert road.

                         but...

               Forrest and his followers job through a small town. A man 
               runs up and talks to Forrest.

                         Some of those people asked me if I 
                         could help them out.

                                     AGING HIPPIE
                         Hey, man, hey, listen. I was wondering 
                         if you might help me, huh? Listen, 
                         I'm in the bumper sticker business 
                         and I've been trying to think up a 
                         good slogan. And since you have been 
                         such a big inspiration to the people 
                         around here, I thought you might be 
                         able to help me jump into... Whoa!
                         Man, you just ran through a big pile 
                         of dogshit!

               The hippie jumps over the "dogshit" as he runs along Forrest.

                         Sometimes.

               The hippie stops to ponder this profound thought.

                         And some years later I heard that 
                         fella did come up with a bumper 
                         sticker slogan...

               A bumper sticker reads "Shit Happens."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...and he make a lot of money off of 
                         it.

               The truck with the bumper sticker drives into an intersection.

               It collides with a car.

               EXT. TRUCK STOP

               Forrest runs, followed by his group, as a man runs up to 
               him.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Another time I was running along, 
                         somebody who had lost all his money 
                         in the T-shirt business, and he wanted 
                         to put my face on a T-shirt, but he 
                         couldn't draw that well and he didn't 
                         have a camera.

                         I think it would be really fortunate 
                         for me if I could get your name on 
                         these, oh, your face and name on 
                         these T-shirts. It would be wonderful.

               A truck splashes mud onto Forrest as it goes by. The man 
               hands Forrest a yellow T-shirt to use as a rag to wipe the 
               mud off.

                                     WILD-EYED MAN
                         Here, use this one. Nobody likes 
                         that color anyway.

               Forrest wipes his face on the towel and hands it back to the 
               man.

                                     FORREST
                         Have a nice day.

               The man looks at the T-shirt. He holds it up displaying the 
               "Happy Face."

                         And some years later I found out 
                         that that man did come up with a 
                         idea for a T-shirt and he made a lot 
                         of money off of it.

               EXT. MONUMENT VALLEY

               Forrest runs with a group that follows behind him.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Anyway, like I was saying, I had a 
                         lot of company. My Momma always said 
                         you got to put the past behind you 
                         before you can move on. And I think 
                         that's what my running was all about.
                         I had run for three years, two months, 
                         fourteen days, and sixteen hours.

               Forrest stops running. The group stops behind him. Forrest 
               stands and looks as the group waits expectantly. Forrest 
               turns and look.

                         I'm pretty tired. I think I'll go 
                         home now.

               Forrest walks toward the group. The group parts for Forrest 
               as he walks down the middle of the road.

                         was over. So, I went home to Alabama.

               A television shows President Reagan and his staff as they 
               react to gunshots in front of a limo.

               EXT. BUS STOP - PRESENT

               Forrest takes the letter out of his pocket.

                         ...wondering if I could come down to 
                         Savannah to see her, and that's what 
                         I'm doing here. She saw me on TV, 
                         running, I'm supposed to go on the

                         1-9-4-7 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

               The elderly woman looks at the letter.

                         Why, you don't need to take a bus.
                         Henry Street is just five or six 
                         blocks down that way.

               Forrest hastily grabs his suitcase and letter as he stands.

               Forrest runs, the elderly woman shouts from the bus stop 
               bench. A truck honks its horn as Forrest runs across the 
               street past the truck.

               Jenny shuts the door. Forrest looks around.

               Jenny picks up a scrapbook and turns the pages.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, I kept, I kept a scrapbook of 
                         your, of your clippings and 
                         everything. There you are. This, I 
                         got your running.

                                     FORREST
                         I ran a long way. For a long time.

                                     JENNY
                         There. Listen, Forrest. I don't know 
                         how to say this. Um, I just... I 
                         want to apologize for anything that 
                         I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed 
                         up for a long time, and...

               There is a knock at the door. LYNN MARIE enters as she opens 
               the door.

                                     LYNN MARIE
                         Yoo-hoo.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey.

                                     LYNN MARIE
                         Hi.

               Jenny grabs a young boy.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, you. This is an old friend from 
                         Alabama.

                                     LYNN MARIE
                         Oh, how do you do?

                                     JENNY
                         Ah, listen, next week my schedule 
                         changes, so I'll be able to... but 
                         thanks for picking up.

                                     LYNN MARIE
                         No problem. Got to go, Jen. I'm double 
                         parked.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay.

               Lynn Marie closes the door and waves bye to Forrest.

                                     LYNN MARIE
                         Bye.

                                     JENNY
                         Thanks. This is very good friend, 
                         Mr. Gump. Can you say hi to him?

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         Hello, Mr. Gump.

                                     FORREST
                         Hello.

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         Now, can I go watch TV now?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

               The little boy runs into other room and picks up TV remote 
               control.

                                     FORREST
                         You're a momma, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm a momma. His name is Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Like me.

                                     JENNY
                         I named him after his Daddy.

                                     FORREST
                         He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

                                     JENNY
                         You're his daddy, Forrest.

               Forrest continues to stare at Forrest Jr. Forrest then looks 
               frightened and starts to back away.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, Forrest, look at me. Look at 
                         me, Forrest. There's nothing you 
                         need to do, okay? You didn't do 
                         anything wrong. Okay?

               Jenny turns and looks at Forrest Jr. in the other room.

                                     JENNY
                         Isn't he beautiful?

                                     FORREST
                         He's the most beautiful thing I've 
                         ever seen. But... is, is he smart, 
                         or is he...

                                     JENNY
                         He's very smart. He's one of the 
                         smartest in his class.

               Forrest breathes deep. He looks at Jenny, then at Forrest 
               Jr.

                                     JENNY
                         Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

               Forrest walks into the room and sits down next to Forrest 
               Jr. "Sesame Street" is on the TV.

                                     BERT
                         Oh, great.

                                     ERNIE
                         Hey, Bert, can you give me a hand?

                                     BERT
                         A hand? Well, yeah, what do you want, 
                         Ernie?

                                     FORREST
                         What are you watching.

                                     FORREST JR.
                         Bert and Ernie.

                                     ERNIE
                         Well, it's the first stage. Bert. 
                         It's planning to write a story, Bert. 
                         I have pencils right here to write 
                         with, Bert. Now, we got, uh, paper. 
                         I'll take that paper, Bert. See, we 
                         have the paper to write on.

               EXT. PARK - DAY

               Forrest and Jenny sit on a bench. Forrest Jr. swings behind 
               them.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, I'm sick.

                                     FORREST
                         What, do you have a cough due to 
                         cold?

                                     JENNY
                         I have some kind virus. And the 
                         doctors don't, they don't know what 
                         it is. And there isn't anything they 
                         can do about it.

                                     FORREST
                         You could come home with me. Jenny, 
                         you and little Forrest could come 
                         stay at my house in Greenbow. I'll 
                         take care of you if you're sick.

                                     JENNY
                         Would you marry me, Forrest?

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               A group has gathered on the lawn for the wedding. Louise 
               walks up to Forrest.

                                     MINISTER
                         Please take your seats.

                                     LOUISE
                         Forrest, it's time to start.

               Jenny walks out of the house. Forrest walks over to greet 
               her. She wears a white dress. She walks up to Forrest and 
               adjusts his necktie.

                                     JENNY
                         Hi. Your tie.

               Lt. Dan is walking across the lawn. He uses a cane. A WOMAN 
               is walking next to him.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan? Lieutenant Dan!

                                     LT. DAN
                         Hello, Forrest.

               Jenny walks over to Forrest and Lt. Dan.

                                     FORREST
                         You got new legs. New legs!

                                     LT. DAN
                         Yeah, I got new legs.

               Lt. Dan lifts his pant leg to display his metal leg.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Custom-made titanium alloy. It's 
                         what they use on the space shuttle.

                                     FORREST
                         Magic legs.

                                     LT. DAN
                         This is my fiancee, Susan.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan!

               Susan shakes Forrest's hand.

                                     SUSAN
                         Hi, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, it's nice to meet you, finally.

               Jenny steps forward and kisses Lt. Dan's cheek. The group is 
               seated as they watch Forrest and Jenny take vows on the front 
               lawn. Forrest Jr. stands next to Jenny.

                                     MINISTER
                         Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be 
                         your wife? Do you, Jenny, take Forrest 
                         to be your husband? If so, I pronounce 
                         you man and wife.

               The wind blows fallen leaves across the ground. Jenny, 
               Forrest, and Forrest Jr. walk toward the house. They all 
               hold hands as they walk.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING

               Forrest steps into Jenny's bedroom. He carries a tray with 
               breakfast on it. Forrest looks at Jenny as she sleeps.

               Slowly she wakes up and looks at Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey.

               Forrest sets the tray down next to Jenny as she sits up in 
               bed. Forrest opens a window, then sits down next to the bed.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, Forrest, were you scared in 
                         Vietnam?

                                     FORREST
                         Yes. Well, I, I don't know.

               EXT. VIETNAM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

               Forrest looks up into the sky as the rain stops. Forrest 
               removes his helmet. The stars emerge from behind the clouds.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes it would stop raining long 
                         enough for the stars to come out. 
                         And then it was nice. It was like 
                         just before the sun goes to bed down 
                         on the bayou...

               EXT. BAYOU - FLASHBACK - SUNSET

               Forrest stands on his boat and looks at a deep orange and 
               red sunset.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         There was over a million sparkles on 
                         the water. Like that mountain lake.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - FLASHBACK - DAY

               Forrest runs along a highway. A lake reflects the mountains 
               and the sky.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It was so clear, Jenny. It looks 
                         like there were two skies, one on 
                         top of the other. And then in the 
                         desert, when the sun comes up...

               EXT. DESERT - FLASHBACK - SUNRISE

               Forrest runs along a desert highway. The morning light casts 
               an orange glow over the desert.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I couldn't tell where heavens stopped 
                         and the earth began. It was so 
                         beautiful.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING

               Forrest looks at Jenny. Jenny looks out the window.

                                     JENNY
                         I wish I could have been there with 
                         you.

                                     FORREST
                         You were.

               Jenny reaches over and takes Forrest's hand.

                                     JENNY
                         I love you.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         You died on a Saturday morning.

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE AT OLD OAK TREE - DAY

               Forrest stands under the old oak tree where Jenny has been 
               buried.

                                     FORREST
                         And I had you placed here under our 
                         tree.

               Jenny's grave marker. Forrest tries to hold back his tears.

                                     FORREST
                         And I had that house of your father's 
                         bulldozed to the ground.

               EXT. JENNY'S OLD HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest watches as Jenny's dad's house is knocked down by a 
               bulldozer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma...

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE

                                     FORREST
                         ...always said dyin' was a part of 
                         life.

               Jenny's grave marker reads: JENNY GUMP July 16, 1945 -- March 
               22, 1982 Beloved Mother, Wife and Friend

                                     FORREST
                         I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest, 
                         he's doing just fine.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest Jr. reads a book to Forrest sitting next to him.

                                     FORREST JR.
                              (reading)
                         "But he wasn't quite sure. Everywhere 
                         they went, the new guests...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         About to start school again soon. I 
                         make his breakfast, lunch, and 
                         dinner...

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE

               Forrest looks down as he sobs.

                                     FORREST
                         ...every day. I make sure he combs 
                         his hair and brushes his teeth every 
                         day. Teaching him how to play ping 
                         pong.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest tries to teach Forrest Jr. how to play ping-pong.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He's really good.

                                     FORREST
                         Forrest, you go.

               Forrest Jr. serves the ball, causing Forrest dive and miss 
               it.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE/RIVER - DAY

               Forrest and Forrest Jr. sit on a log by the river and fish.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We fish a lot.

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE

               Forrest looks down at the grave marker.

                                     FORREST
                         And every night, we read a book.
                         He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so 
                         proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a 
                         letter, and he says I can't read it. 
                         I'm not supposed to, so I'll just 
                         leave it here for you.

               Forrest places the letter down at the grave marker, next to 
               fresh flowers. The name on the envelope reads: "Mom." Forrest 
               steps back and looks down at the grave.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny, I don't know if Momma was 
                         right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan.
                         I don't know if we each have a 
                         destiny, or if we're all just floating 
                         around accidental-like on a breeze, 
                         but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe 
                         both is happening at the same time. 
                         I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything 
                         you need, I won't be far away.

               As Forrest walks away, a flock of birds flies overhead and 
               lands in the tree. Forrest turns and watches.

               EXT. ROAD - MORNING

               Forrest walks with Forrest Jr. for the bus. The bus drives 
               toward them.

                                     FORREST
                         Here's your bus. Okay.

               Forrest pulls "Curious George" out of Forrest Jr.'s backpack.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey, I know this.

                                     FORREST JR.
                         I'm gonna show that for show-and-
                         tell because grandma used to read it 
                         to you.

               Forrest looks at the book. The feather from the beginning of 
               the movie drops out of the book, unnoticed.

                                     FORREST
                         My favorite book.

               The bus comes to a stop. The door opens.

                                     FORREST
                         Well...

               Forrest puts the book back into Forrest Jr.'s backpack and 
               hands it to him.

                                     FORREST
                         ...okay. Hey, there you go.

               Forrest Jr. walks toward the bus. Forrest stands up.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey, Forrest. Don't... I wanted to 
                         tell you I love you.

                                     FORREST JR.
                         I love you too, Daddy.

                                     FORREST
                         I'll be right here when you get back.

               Forrest Jr. looks into the bus and at the bus driver. It is 
               the same bus driver, only older now, who drove Forrest to 
               school when he was a young boy.

                                     SCHOOLD BUS DRIVER
                         You understand this is the bus to 
                         school now, don't you?

                                     FORREST JR.
                         Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris 
                         and I'm Forrest Gump.

               Forrest Jr. looks over and waves to his father. Forrest nods 
               approvingly.

               Forrest Jr. gets on the bus. The bus pulls away. Forrest 
               stands next to the mailbox.

               Forrest sits down. The camera cranes down, revealing the 
               feather as it lies at Forrest's feet.

               A gust of wind picks the feather up. The feather floats up 
               into the air.

               Forrest sits at the side of the road. The feather floats 
               higher into the air.

               The feather soars up into the sky and travels up and down, 
               then covers the camera lens.

                                         THE END
FREAKED

          INT. REGIS & KATHIE LEE SHOW SET
                         
          A horribly deformed figure--hunchback, misshapen head--sits
          on a stool in complete silhouette. This is RICK COOGAN.
                         
                          RICK
           Can you imagine it, Regis, Kathie
           Lee? One day I'm a hot young
           movie star, and the next day I'm a
           hideous mutant freak, covered with
           festering lesions.
                         
          Oddly, REGIS and KATHIE LEE are also in complete silhouette.
                         
                          REGIS
           Sounds like my wife when she misses
           a mudpack!
                         
          The audience CRACKS UP. Kathie Lee pooh-poohs Regis.
                         
                          KATHIE LEE
           Oh Regis! You're incorrigible! Ha-
           ha!
           (to Rick, she turns
                          EARNEST)
           Ricky, once you were the all-
           American boy next door, star of the
           beloved Hey Dude films. Now the
           very mention of your name makes
           children scream in terror. We've
           all read about your disturbing
           story. But the people want to hear
           it from you, Ricky Coogan.
           (SFX: children scream)
           Won't you tell us your story?
                         
                          RICK
           Well, it's kinda long, but okay.
           It all started when I signed a deal
           to be spokesman for the E.E.S.
           conglomerate...
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          INT. E.E.S. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
                         
          The E.E.S. logo--a large metal shoe with a bar across it,
          with the words "Everything Except Shoes" beneath. Widen to
          reveal RICHARD HERTZ, president of E.E.S., smiling rigidly to
          camera. RICK COOGAN is next to him, also holding a stiff
          movie-star smile. FLASH! They shake hands as the EES
          photographer takes publicity shots. Off to one side, behind
          Hertz, are several EES EXECUTIVES. Behind Rick is his
          entourage: LAWYER, BODYGUARD, TRAINER, STYLIST, and SPIRIT
          GUIDE.
           2.
                         
                         
          Further off, at the boardroom table, four DODDERING OLD
          CORPORATE FARTS on the brink of death look on with glazed
          expressions.
                         
                          RICK
           (through a clenched smile)
           So, what kind of crap do you
           scumbags want me to peddle?
                         
                          HERTZ
           Everything. Everything except
           shoes, of course. Hah hah...
                         
          He laughs pathetically. Rick doesn't respond. Hertz nods to
          a nearby EXECUTIVE who hands him some BEEF STICKS.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Meaty Twig Beef Sticks.
                         
          Rick takes them and holds them up to the camera. Smiles.
          Flash.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Helmet Head hair spray.
                         
          He takes the hair spray and holds it up. Smile. Flash.
                         
          The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal
          container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it.
          Hertz gives it to Rick.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro-
           fertilizer.
                         
          Rick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust.
                         
                          RICK
           Fertilizer? Ricky Coogan does not
           do ads for hi-tech cow shit. I'm a
           star, got it, Hertz?
           (to his aide)
           Rico, give these misguided clowns
           Tony Danza's phone number, and
           let's get the hell out of here.
                         
          He gives the finger to the EES photographer, who obligingly
          takes a picture. Hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls
          after Rick who's headed to the door with his entourage.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Rick. Wait! Only you can stand up
           to the radicals trying to keep
           Noxon from the struggling farmers
           whose very future depends on it.
           3.

                          (HESITATES)
           Noxon? Wasn't that just banned?
                         
                          HERTZ
           Only in the U.S....and Europe.
                         
                          RICK
           But I heard that shit's lethal.
                         
          Hertz lets out a big laugh. He shakes his head at Rick.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Rick, Rick, Rick... You want
           proof? Fine. Just take a seat.
           Please.
                         
          Rick nods to his entourage. They sit at the boardroom table,
          across from the EES execs. An easel behind Hertz shows a
          placard with a bar graph. Hertz whispers something to an
          aide, who scurries off.
                         
                          HERTZ
                          (TO RICK)
           Meet the head of our South American
           research facility, Juan Valdez.
                         
          The aide ushers in a handsome LATIN AMERICAN EXECUTIVE in a
          natty three-piece suit and a sombrero.
                         
                          GEORGE

                          HERTZ
           Whatever. He's worked with Noxon
           24 every day for five years, and
           he's in fine shape. Aren't you,
           Juan?
                         
          George glares at Hertz bitterly. Hertz stares him down.
                         
                          GEORGE
           Yes. I am fine. Me and my team in
           Santa Flan have--
                         
                          RICK
           Santa "Flan?" What kind of shitty
           name for a country is that?
                         
                          GEORGE
           It is named for the patron saint of
           creamy desserts... As I was
           saying, we've worked very closely
           with Noxon...
           4.
                         
                         
          Rick nods. We cut back to George, but he isn't George
          anymore. He has mutated into a similar looking actor, in the
          same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier.
                         
                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           I personally supervised its
           development...
                         
          Rick furrows his brow. He's a little suspicious of George's
          transformation, but just a little.
                         
          Now George is even shorter, even swarthier. Yet another
          actor.
                         
                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           I performed rigorous scientific
           tests. No potential danger was
           left uninvestigated...
                         
          Rick's suspicion is increasing. He looks over to Hertz, who
          feigns total innocence.
                         
          George is now even shorter. Still another actor. His
          clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down
          over his face.
                         
                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           The environmentalists are
           crackpots, all of them.
                         
          Rick looks at his entourage. Their mouths hang open in
          astonishment.
                         
          George has now shrunk to near-midget proportions. The
          sombrero completely covers his head. When he takes it off,
          we see he's now played by LINDA HUNT!
                         
                          GEORGE
           It's ridiculous, I tell you.
           Totally ridiculous!
                         
          Rick is ready to ask questions, but Hertz cuts him off.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Thank you, Valdez. That will be
           all.
                         
          George nods and heads back to his seat. As he passes behind
          Hertz, he can't resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and
          making a face.
                         
                          RICK
           Wait a second--
           5.
                         
                         
                          HERTZ
           Ricky, this is important. We're
           talking about a major threat to the
           EES image. How does 2 million
           dollars plus expenses sound?
                         
          The aide reveals a new placard on the easel. It reads "$2
          MILLION."
                         
                          RICK
           Look, it sounds great, but--
                         
                          HERTZ
           I hear you. Make it five million--
           (a new placard: 5 MILLION)
           that is, if the board agrees ...
                         
          Hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever. The old
          geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were
          being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Good, it's unanimous. Well, what
           do you say, Ricky? Are you EES's
           "Man in Santa Flan?"
                         
          Rick looks at his advisors--they look over at Linda Hunt,
          then emphatically shake their heads "NO." Rick looks at
          Hertz, who shows him five big fingers and grins. Rick breaks
          into a big smile and gives Hertz his trademark thumbs up
          sign.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. L.A. AIRPORT SECURITY CHECK
                         
          Rick stands in line at the luggage X-ray machine. He
          impatiently checks his watch as the X-RAY CHECKER chats him
          up. A CRAZED ANARCHIST holding a large bomb passes through
          the security check unquestioned.
                         
                          X-RAY CHECKER
           My kids just loved you in "Hey Dude
           Three: The Final Countdown." We
           need more wholesome role models
           like you.
                         
                          RICK
           Uh-huh.
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Where the fuck is Ernie?
           6.
                         
                         
          We hear WOMEN'S SCREAMS. They turn towards the noise and see
          a bunch of STEWARDESSES scattering from a trendy young cad
          with a fake hand sticking out of his fly. This is ERNIE,
          Rick's buddy and resident court jester.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Ladies! All I wanted was a
           manicure! Yah-ha-ha!
           (he sees Rick)
           IT'S THE COOG!
                         
                          RICK
           IT'S THE ERNIE! WOOF! WOOF!
           WOOF!
                         
          Rick pumps Ernie's third "hand." The miffed X-ray checker
          points to Rick's large carry-on bag as it emerges from the X-
          ray machine.
                         
                          X-RAY CHECKER
                          (TO RICK)
           Mister Coogan, is this your bag?
                         
                          RICK
           Yeah, why?
                         
                          X-RAY CHECKER
           Is this your kid?
                         
          He indicates the X-ray monitor, where we see the skeleton
          outline of a BUCKTOOTHED, BESPECTACLED 10 YEAR OLD KID curled
          up in Rick's bag. The kid waves. Rick and Ernie look at
          each other in horror.
                         
                          RICK/ERNIE
           Stuey Gluck!
                         
          The bag bursts open, and out pops STUEY GLUCK, an obsessive
          young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and
          memorabilia.
                         
                          STUEY
           Rick! Rick! Look! I got a rare
           still from your high school
           production of The Glass Menagerie!
           Could you sign it for me?
           Please?!
                         
                          RICK
           NO!
                          (TO ERNIE)
           Let's get the hell out of here!
           7.
                         
                         
          Ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under Stuey. They run
          away down the corridor. Stuey chases them, holding up an 8
          by 10 photo.
                         
                          STUEY
           Rick! Wait up!
                         
          FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR
                         
          Rick and Ernie run around a corner with Stuey in pursuit.
                         
                          STUEY
           Rick! Remember the speech you gave
           at the Actors Forum for Social
           Justice!?
                         
          He holds up a cassette player and hits play. It's Rick's old
          speech.
                         
           RICK'S VOICE (FROM TAPE)
           If all the world is a stage, then
           let us shine the spotlight on
           truth, integrity, and a deep
           compassion for all life.
                         
                          RICK
           Leave me alone, troll!
                          (TO ERNIE)
           That was before I got an
           entertainment lawyer.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Quick, down here.
                         
          Ernie leads Rick down an adjacent hallway.
                         
          IN THE HALLWAY
                         
          It's a dead end. Rick and Ernie are trapped. Ernie gives
          Rick a sheepish look. Stuey stands at the entrance of the
          hallway. He holds up a Time magazine.
                         
                          STUEY
           Rick! Rick! It says here Noxon's
           dangerous. Why are you lending
           your name to it? What's happened
           to you, Rick? You used to be
           good! And now... I just don't
           know...
                         
          Stuey starts to cry. Rick looks guilty.
                         
                          RICK
           Don't cry, Stuey, I'm still good.
           8.
                         
                         
          BAM! A passing electric baggage cart nails Stuey at full
          speed and carries him off down the corridor, screaming bloody
          murder.
                         
                          RICK
           ALRIGHT!
                         
          Rick and Ernie high five.

          INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY
                         
          A SEXY STEWARDESS pours champagne for Rick and Ernie. The
          anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap. Rick winks
          suggestively at the stewardess. She walks off, obviously not
          interested. Rick raises his glass to Ernie, oozing sleazy
          confidence.
                         
                          RICK
           In the bag.
                         
          The plane hits turbulence, and Rick's drink flies up out of
          his glass--he catches it as it comes down. Another
          STEWARDESS helps the Anarchist put his bomb in the overhead
          compartment. Ernie ogles her. She sneers at him. We hear
          the CAPTAIN'S voice on the loudspeaker.
                         
           CAPTAIN (V.0.)
           Ladies and gentlemen, this is your
           captain speaking. To the right of
           the aircraft, you can see a great
           view of the Grand Canyon.
                         
          All the passengers crane their necks to the right.
                         
           CAPTAIN (V.0.)
           And to the left you can see a panic-
           stricken little troll.
                         
          Rick turns to his window and flings open the shade to
          reveal...
                         
                         STUEY
                         
          on the wing, pressing his face up against the glass. He's
          holding up a publicity shot of Rick and screaming something
          we can't hear.
                         
                          RICK
           AHHHHHHH!
                         
          Stuey loses his grip and is whisked off the wing. Rick
          watches him fall into oblivion.
           9.
                         
          Relieved, he turns nonchalantly to Ernie, ignoring the other
          horrified passengers.
                         
                          RICK

          THUD! Stuey misses the haystack by a few feet. He hops to
          his feet and dusts himself off.
                         
                          STUEY

           10.
                         
                         
          Standing just outside the airport. A porter follows with
          their bags.
                         
                          RICK
           Sure glad that wasn't our plane.
                         
          Ernie nods. They're distracted by the sound of chanting.
          They squint into the distance, where they see a group of
          chanting PROTESTERS--young "Save the Earth" types, latter-day
          hippies, kids, seniors, etc.
                         
                          PROTESTERS
           EES mustn't stay! Take your toxic
           crap away! EES mustn't stay!
           (etc.)
                         
          Some of their signs read--"Say No to Noxon!", "Coogan Go
          Home", "EES is killing our Earth!", "Ricky Coogan Sucks Shit"
          (this one held by a nice LITTLE GIRL), "I Like Ike" (held by
          a confused OLD MAN, shuffling around aimlessly), "Drink
          Pepsi" and finally...
                         
          "Free Nelson Mandela"--we WIDEN to reveal the subheading:
          "Inside specially marked boxes." We keep WIDENING to reveal
          that this is not on a protest placard, but a box of cereal
          some GUY is eating as he watches the protest.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Jesus! We better find the limo
           before these whale kissers chop us
           up and sell us for parts.
           (he spots the limo)
           There it is.
                         
          Off to the side, away from the protesters, an unmarked limo
          with tinted windows (and plates that say NOT EES) awaits.
          KEVIN, an EES exec, leans out the window and waves discreetly
          at Ricky. The stewardesses, looking tipsy, wave their bras
          out the back window invitingly.
                         
          Ernie tries to grab Ricky by the arm, but he resists. He's
          looking at the protesters.
                         
                          RICK
           Wait a second...
                         
          His POV...
                         
          A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
                         
          standing in the center of the crowd of protesters, holding a
          MEGAPHONE to her mouth and chanting. She puts down the
          megaphone to rest, and we can see that she's powerfully
          beautiful, in a no-nonsense feminist kind of way. This is
          JULIE. Rick is smitten.
           11.
                         
                         
                          ERNIE
           Let's go, Rick. They're waitin'.
                         
                          RICK
           Forget them. I got a better idea.
           If I can just find the right
           disguise...
                         
                          ERNIE
           Coog, those hippies'll tear us
           apart.
                         
          Rick spots a HEAVILY BANDAGED MAN limping out of the airport
          on crutches. Rick approaches him, waving a roll of bills.
                         
                          RICK
           Hey, how'd you like to make a quick
           hundred bucks?
                         
          The man mutters something weakly. Ernie puts his ear up
          close to hear him better.
                         
                          ERNIE
           He says the pants don't usually
           come off for less than two-fifty,
           but since you're so cute, he'll
           make an exception.
                         
                          FLIP TO:
                         
                         RICK
                         
          buried beneath rolls and rolls of bandages, making his way
          through the protesters on crutches. Ernie helps him along,
          nervously. As Rick spots Julie from behind, he hands the
          crutches over to Ernie.
                         
                          RICK
           Here.
                         
          Ernie takes the crutches. Rick waves his arms dramatically,
          clutches his bandaged legs, and winces in pain.
                         
                          RICK
           Help! Ow! Give me back my
           crutches! You monster! Oh, the
           pain! The agony!
                         
          He falls theatrically at Julie's feet.
                         
                          JULIE
           Are you okay? Let me help you!
           12.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Thanks. Don't worry about me.
           What's one man's pain weighed
           against the global injustice of
           corporate tyrants like EES? Go.
           The fight must continue.
                         
          Julie's buying it big time. She gazes deep into Rick's eyes.
                         
                          JULIE
           Wow... My name's Julie.
                         
                          RICK
           Josh. Josh Tavner.
                         
          Ernie sticks a hand out, grinning sarcastically.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Mother Theresa. Glad to meet you.
                         
          Julie turns on Ernie viciously. She slaps him hard, and
          grabs the crutches from him.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Ow! Hey!
                         
                          JULIE
           Give me those, ape. Help him up.
                         
          Rick rises to his feet "painfully."
                         
                          JULIE
           Hey Josh, a busload of us are
           headed over to Maracas to protest
           Noxon 24 and pelt Ricky Coogan with
           cow shit.
                         
                          RICK
           Same here! You could ride with us.
                         
                          JULIE
           Us? You're with him?
                         
          She looks at Ernie, who grins stupidly.
                         
                          RICK
           Oh, he's okay. Have you ever heard
           of an idiot savant?
                         
                          JULIE
           Sure.
                         
                          RICK
           That's Ernie. Except for the
           savant part.
           13.
                         
                         
          Ernie glares at Rick. Rick smiles at Julie hopefully. Julie
          looks at them both, and can't help smiling herself.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CAR - DAY
                         
          Ernie drives the battered old convertible which bears the
          proud logo of Santa Flan Rent-a-Car. There's a Pepsi
          billboard in the background. Julie massages Rick in the back
          seat.
                         
                          RICK
           (faking terrible pain)
           Ooooh, my pelvis.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (SYMPATHETIC)
           Is this better?
                         
          ERNIE'S POV IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
                         
          Rick moans and cracks a huge grin through his bandages.
          Ernie tries to get in on the conversation.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey Julie. You know I'm kind of an
           idea man myself. Like, let's say
           there's a nuclear war, and the only
           two people left are you and the
           Pope... Would you pork him?
                         
          Disgusted, Julie smacks Ernie sharply and continues massaging
          Rick. Scowling with jealousy, Ernie tries a new approach.
                         
                          ERNIE
           But one thing's for sure. That
           Coogan guy sure is an asshole, huh?
                         
                          JULIE
           I'll say! What a total piece of
           shit. Don't you think so, Josh?
                         
          Rick grits his teeth.
                         
                          RICK
                          (MUMBLES NONCOMMITTALLY)
           Well, he's got a few problems.
                         
                          JULIE
           And what a lousy actor! I mean can
           you believe that "Hey Dude" crap?
           14.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Well, with a script that bad,
           Coogan deserves an Oscar for coming
           off as good as he did!
                          (CATCHES HIMSELF)
           I mean, that's what I read.
                         
                          JULIE
           Well, he's no Christian Slater.
                         
                          RICK
                          (EXPLODES)
           SLATER!? I could act circles
           around that one-note hack! He was
           shittin' his diapers when I was the
           toast of Broadway! I made grown
           men cry! I made crippled children
           laugh! Now all I ever hear is
           Slater! Slater! Slater! WELL
           SLATER CAN KISS MY ASS! YOU HEAR
           ME?
                         
          Enraged, Rick rips the bandages off his face.
                         
                          RICK
           You think Slater could improv like
           this? Make you believe he was an
           invalid!? Huh!?
                         
          Julie stares at him in shock. Rick catches his breath,
          realizes what he's just done, and smiles weakly. Ernie tries
          to break the awkward silence.
                         
                          ERNIE
                          (TO JULIE)
           So, do you like Swedish films?
                         
          Julie gives him a murderous look.

          Julie's been lecturing Rick for some time now.
                         
                          JULIE
           You don't even want to hear the
           truth about Noxon, do you, Coogan?

                          JULIE(CONT'D)
           I mean, look, I'm not saying this
           stuff is going to turn anyone into
           a... a...
                         
                         RICK'S POV
                         
          on the road behind Julie he sees a crude carnival billboard
          featuring a painting of a huge worm with a man's head. It
          reads "See the Incredabel Humin Werm! Only at Elijah C.
          Skuggs Famus Freek Land." Julie can't see it.
                         
                          RICK
                          (DISTRACTED)
           Human worm...
                         
                          JULIE
           Right. A human worm. I mean,
           that's just stupid. The point is--
                         
          Rick sees another billboard for the freak show. This one
          features a half-man/half-dog creature and says "See the
          Aztownding Dawg Boy!"
                         
                          RICK
           Dog boy...
                         
                          JULIE
           Yeah, or a dog boy. That's absurd.
                          BUT--
                         
          Another billboard. This one features the "Hidyous Frawg
          Man."
                         
                          RICK
           Hideous frog man.
                         
                          JULIE
           Okay, okay. Now you're just being
           silly. Human suffering's just a
           big joke to you, huh? You are
           sick, Coogan!
                         
          She turns away from him in a huff and looks out her window.
          She sees a billboard that reads "See The Hole Amazing Famly
          of Freekz at Elijah C. Skuggs Famus Freek Land and Mutent
          Emporeum!"
                         
                          JULIE
           Cool! A freak show! Let's check
           it out!
                         
                          RICK
           Kind of like a family reunion for

           Lighten up, Coog, could be a goof.
                         
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE ROADWAY
                         
          The car turns into a driveway near a crude, hand painted sign
          that says "FreekzTM--Thiss waey" with a messy arrow...
                         
          We ZOOM IN to the hand painted "small print" on the bottom of
          the sign, which reads--"Freekz is a registered trademark of
          Elijah C. Skuggs Enterprises. Any unauthorized reproduction
          is strictly prohibited without prior written consent."
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. FREEKZ COMPOUND
                         
          The car stops at the end of the long, spooky driveway, just
          past a sizzling electric fence. Rick, Julie, and Ernie get
          out and look around. It's eerily quiet.
                         
          There is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted
          ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with
          an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy
          broken-down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant
          molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly
          rotates on a creaky base.
                         
          Ernie looks hard at the big eyes. He turns away for a
          second, then spins around again. The EYES are looking in a
          different direction. Ernie shakes his head and unwraps a
          chocolate bar.
                         
                          JULIE
           Isn't it great? It's so "real"...
                         
                          RICK
           Real stupid.
                          (TO ERNIE)
           Let's go. This place is dead.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Yeah. Where are all the weirdos?
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           There are no weirdos here.
                         
          Startled, they turn to see ELIJAH C. SKUGGS, a twisted,
          haggard old man. He takes a bite out of an ice cream cone
          which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino
          cherry on top. Elijah has bad teeth, a bad shave, and scary
          eyes. We now realize the giant head is molded in his image.
           17.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Mutants, yes. Genetic nightmares,
           definitely. Children of Hell and
           twisted masses of living, breathing
           tormented flesh, certainly. But as
           for weirdos... not a one. Unless
           of course you count me! Ha ha ha!
                         
                          RICK
           Nah, you seem like a regular
           dumbshit old redneck to me.
                         
          Elijah ignores him. Julie shoots him a look and smiles at
          Elijah.
                         
                          JULIE
           I'm Julie. And you are...
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Elijah C. Skuggs, proud proprietor
           of Skugg's Fabulous Freak Land and
           Mutant Emporium. But you knew
           that. After all, you've ventured
           miles away from civilization,
           hospitals, telephones,
                          (TO RICK)
           police... How may I help-you?
                         
                          RICK
           Drop dead.
                         
          Elijah smiles, unfazed. Julie glares at Rick. She smiles
          apologetically at Elijah.
                         
                          JULIE
           We'd like to see your freak show.
           You see, only by appreciating the
           variety and innovation of nature
           can we come to respect the fragile
           complexity of our global eco-
           system.
                         
          Elijah nudges Ernie.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           And you come to me looking for
           weirdos?
                         
          Ernie shrugs. He goes to take a bite out of his chocolate
          bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey! What the--
                         
          He looks behind him, and there--about ten feet away--is...
           18.
                         
                         
          A HULKING BALD MAN
                         
          warts all over, squatting on the ground and chewing happily.
          This is TOAD.
                         
          Julie and Rick turn and see him.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (REPULSED)
           Eeuuuwww...
           (composes herself and
                          WAVES)
           Ahem. Hello.
                         
          Toad doesn't respond to her waves.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Mr. Toad is my... assistant. As
           for the show, I'm afraid the next
           parade of deformity isn't until
           tomorrow night...
                         
          Rick and Ernie pretend to be disappointed. They turn to
          leave. Julie's sincerely upset.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh, just our luck...
                         
          Elijah grabs Rick's shoulder and turns him around.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           However! I do have a private
           exhibit in my shed you might enjoy.
           I don't usually share it with the
           general public...
                         
                          RICK
           We're deeply honored. But no
           thanks.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Yeah. We really must be--
                         
          He raises his cigarette to his lips, but it's gone! He turns
          to see Toad, ten feet behind him, puffing away happily.
          Hmmm. Elijah is already leading Julie towards the shed.
                         
                          JULIE
           The sideshow tradition has been
           misrepresented by the media. You
           don't traffic in human misery. You
           show society the part of itself it
           doesn't want to look at.
           19.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Yes... Yesm I see...
                         
          He looks over to Rick and Ernie with a grin that says
          "Where'd you find this nutty chick?"
                         
          Rick shrugs and follows, taking Ernie with him.
                         
                          ERNIE
           What the heck. We'll see some
           pickled dog brains, maybe some
           pictures of women with, you know,
           added equipment.
                         
                          RICK
           And to think we could be in the
           limo with those stewardesses.
                         
          Elijah holds the shed door open for them. It's pitch black
          inside. Julie enters. Rick and Ernie follow.
                         
                          ERNIE
           What the hell, Coog, these people
           are weird, but they seem nice
           enough.
                         
          A CUTE BUNNY
                         
          sits outside the shed. THWAP! Toad lashes out with his ten
          foot tongue, and sucks the bunny into his mouth. He shuffles
          into the shed, crunching contentedly.
                         
          Elijah closes the shed doors in our face, grinning. we hear
          a lonq peal of EVIL LAUGHTER from inside.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! HE-HE-HE! HA-
           HAHA! HE-HO-HE-HE-HA-HA! AH-HA-HA-
           HEHA! YAH-HA-HA-HA-HEE-HEE-HO-HA-
           HE-HE!
                         
                         
          INT. SHED
                         
          It's dark and spooky. Elijah stands in a pool of light,
          reading a Family Circus cartoon in the funny pages.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           HA-HE-HE-HE! God I love the Family
           Circus! How do they do it day
           after day? It's amazing.
                         
          He turns to...
                         
          RICK, JULIE, AND.ERNIE
           20.
                         
                         
          as Toad finishes strapping them onto massive Frankenstein-
          style operating tables. They struggle desperately against
                         THE STRAPS
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO ELIJAH)
           ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Well, I guess they do use the same
           joke over and over. I'm just a
           sucker for that little moffet's
           shenanigans, that's all.
           (he tosses the funnies
                          ASIDE)
           But perhaps I should tell you a
           little more about what I do. You
           see, I not only exhibit freaks, I
           make them. Just like Michelangelo
           saw the angel in the stone, I look
           at a guy like Kevin Costner and see
           a giant peach grub who can fart the
           Blue Danube!
           (mops brow, asks
                          OFFHANDEDLY)
           Am I crazy or is it hot in here?
                         
          Rick, Julie, and Ernie shoot him a look that pretty well
          answers his question. Elijah shrugs and goes back to his
          spiel.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Behold! The Tasty Freekz machine!
                         
          He pulls a tarp off a huge complicated machine. Several
          drums and vats of various chemicals feed through a crude
          network of pipes, gadgets and computers into an old Tasty
          Freeze soft serve ice cream machine (The logo has been
          changed to "Tasty Freekz"). The biggest vat reads "NOXON
          24."
                         
                          JULIE
           My God! He's using Noxon Twenty-
           Four!
                         
                          RICK
           Hey! You're not supposed to have
           that stuff!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Oh? Well, I guess I'm not supposed
           to have these either!
           21.
                         
                         
          He holds up a matching towel and washcloth embroidered with
          the "Ramada Inn" logo. Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp. He
          tosses the towels.
                         
          As Elijah gets worked up into a frenzy, the ambience in the
          room becomes more and more horrific: the sunlight is replaced
          by an eerie green glow, a thunderstorm rumbles to life, a
          raven perches on the windowsill, a rat scurries across the
          floor, one of those plastic "Bony Banks" reaches out and
          grabs a quarter...
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I need only punch a few buttons on
           this magnificent device, and it
           gives me an easy-to-apply ointment
           that will mutate a perfect young
           body, bubble its skin, warp its
           bones and twist its guts into AN
           UNSPEAKABLY REPULSIVE, STOMACH-
           TURNING FREAK OF MY OWN DESIGN!
                         
          Elijah's hair is now standing on end. He's foaming at the
          mouth. A bolt of lightning and THUNDERCLAP cap the
          monologue.
                         
                          JULIE
           Wait a minute. Does this mean
           we're not going to see a show?
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (IGNORES HER)
           Toad, fire up that machine, and
           let's turn these hapless asswipes
           into monstrosities!
                         
           RICK, JULIE, ERNIE
                          (TOGETHER)
           AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Now let's see. Who wants to get
           freaked first?
                         
                          ERNIE
           (points at Julie)
           Ladies first!
                         
                          JULIE
           Go screw yourself!
                         
                          ERNIE
           If I were you, I would!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Hmmmm.
           22.
                         
                         
          Toad is adjusting some knobs on the machine. Elijah steps
          past him to a jerry-rigged computer console. He punches some
          keys and some rotating DNA models appear on the monitor.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           (mumbling to himself)
           It's like Yin and Yang... AC/DC...
           two birds with one stone... Yeah,
           it's pretty darn good, really...
                         
          He presses "enter" and the computer beeps. He smiles.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Let 'er rip, Toad!
                         
          Toad yanks a pull-start cord and the machine rumbles to life.
          Elijah pulls the Tasty Freekz lever and fills a small dish
          with phosphorescent ointment. Toad cuts open their clothes,
          exposing their sides, and pushes them close together.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Wait a second. You're really gonna
           smear that stuff on us and mutate
           our body parts!?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Correct.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Well... then could you give me a
           really big rodney?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I'm a mad scientist pal, not a
           miracle worker.
                         
          Elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides. Their
          skin begins to bubble and undulate.
                         
                          JULIE/ERNIE
           Oh God!... No!... Holy shit!
                          (ETC)
                         
          A grapefruit-sized lump pops up on Ernie's side, then another
          on Julie's side, and then the lumps do a little synchronized
          dance together. Suddenly Ernie's flesh balloons out and
          melds into Julie's side. The mass of connected skin
          continues to bubble and mutate. Odd shapes press up under
                         THE SKIN:
                         
          Four humans faces that quickly become Mount Rushmore...
                         
          The Pepsi logo--"Pepsi: The Choice of a New Generation"...
          Julie and Ernie merge into one amorphous flesh blob which
          then takes the form of...
           23.
                         
                         
          Demon versions of GUMBY and his magic horse POKEY. Gumby's
          got his back to camera. He's grabbing his crotch and
          flipping everyone off.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Gumby! Put that thing away!
                         
          Gumby and Pokey mutate back into a blob and then into...
                         
                         JULIE/ERNIE
                         
          joined side to side, their two heads on a single body which
          is split down the middle--half Julie, half Ernie. Elijah
          wheels a large mirror in front of them.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Feast your eyes!
                         
                          JULIE
           NOOOOO!
                         
                          ERNIE
           Well, at least I'll never have to
           go far for a piece of tail.
                         
                          JULIE
           Pig!
                         
          She SMACKS him.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Ouch! I was just trying to keep
           things light. Oh God! Why me!?
                         
          He starts blubbering uncontrollably. Toad drags them towards
          the door.
                         
                          JULIE
           Mother always said there'd be days
           like this. And I thought she was
           nuts!
                         
          They exit. Elijah turns to Rick.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           (gestures to Julie/Ernie)
           A mere party trick. But you,
           you're gonna be special.
                         
          Elijah steps over to the computer console and starts punching
          keys.
                         
                          RICK
                          (GETS TOUGH)
           Let me go, Skuggs, or else!
                          (MORE)
           24.
                         
           I got some RICK(cont'd)
           friends that'll come
           down here and mess you up bad,
           homey!
           (Elijah chuckles. Rick
           tries a different
                          APPROACH)
           I got some other friends who can
           score you box seats at the
           Superbowl, no problem.
                          (ANOTHER FAILURE)
           YOU EVER HAD YOUR BALLS CUT OFF,
           YOU FUCKIN' APE?!
           (switches gears again)
           You ever had a hot fudge bath with
           Morgana? [foreign take: Madonna]
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (LOOKS UP--INTERESTED)
           You know her?
                         
          Rick nods hopefully. Elijah considers it for a moment, then
          frowns.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Ah, screw it. I'd never get
           anywhere with her. TOAD! FIRE UP
           THAT INFERNAL YOGURT MACHINE!
                         
          Toad starts the machine. Elijah pulls the lever and
          dispenses a bowl full of glowing ointment. He carries it
          towards Rick, leering maniacally.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           For years I've strived to create
           the ultimate monster. The first of
           a whole new generation of
           superfreaks! Now I've finally got
           you, the perfect subject--a real
           asshole! HA-HA-
           (he pauses and looks
           closer at Rick)
           Wait a minute. Aren't you the guy
           from "Hey Dude Three-The
           Beguiling?"
                         
                          RICK
           Yeah, that's me!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           You were great in that picture! Oh
           well, I guess for the next one
           they'll have to get Christian
           Slater! HA-HA-HA!
           25.
                         
                         
          Elijah squishes the ointment into Rick's horrified face.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. THE LAB - NIGHT
                         
          The barn looks especially sinister silhouetted against a big
          green moon. A huge ball of flame belches out of the smoke
          stack.
                         
           RICK (O.S.)
           AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRGGGGGGG!
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. THE LAB - MORNING
                         
          It's eerily quiet in the dawn light.
                         
                         
          INT. LAB
                         
          Extreme close-up of Rick's eye as it opens, and searches the
          room frantically. Close-up of Rick's hand--a normal hand--
          straining at the bonds.
                         
          RICK's POV groggily searches the lab, and picks up the
          blurred image of Elijah in the distance. He's on the phone,
          speaking in hushed tones.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           This is Red Swan. May I speak to
           the Laughing Man?... Yes, I'll
           hold.
                         
          For a moment, Elijah is entertained by hold music to the tune
          of "Freak Out," by Chic. A man's laughing voice comes on the
          other end of the line. It laughs throughout the
          "conversation".
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Laughing Man? Red Swan. I've done
           it! I found the perfect subject--
           huge ego, shallow personality,
           almost no moral values... A
           lawyer? No, better. An actor.
           Yeah, the guy from those hilarious
           "Hey Dude" movies! Hahahaha--
                         
          Laughing man has stopped laughing. Elijah dummies up.
           26.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (SHEEPISHLY)
           Well, I liked 'em.
                         
          Laughing man resumes laughing. Elijah listens intently.
                         
                          ELIJAH (CONT'D)
           Right... Yes... Yes, I see...
           But that's just it. He's not
           quite, uh, finished. I need more
           Noxon so I can--
                         
          Laughing Man laughs so loudly Elijah has to hold the phone
          away.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (ASIDE)
           Geez, what a grouch.
                         
          Over on the slab, Rick groans. He's waking up. Elijah
          notices.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           (to Laughing man)
           Laughing Man? I have to go. What
           about the Noxon? Two days? Great,
           you can see everything then...
           Yeah, you take it easy too.
                         
          Elijah hangs up the phone, and strides over towards Rick.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Wakey, wakey. Time to meet and
           greet the new you.
                         
                          RICK
           Huh?
                         
          He flips the slab right-side up, and holds up a mirror.
          Rick's eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new
          form. Rick's left half has been transformed into a hideous,
          bug-eyed monster!
                         
                          RICK
           AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. LAB - MORNING
                         
          BANG! The doors fly open. Elijah drags Rick out.
          Horrified, Rick clutches the monster side of his face.
           27.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Oh God! This was my good side!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Still is if you ask me! Hell, even
           half-done, you'll be the star of
           the show tonight.
                         
          Elijah stops in front of the tiny outhouse.
                         
                          ELIJAH (CONT'D)
           Welcome to your spacious
           accommodations.
                         
          He unlocks the door and drags Rick in.
                         
                         
          INT. OUTHOUSE
                         
          Oddly, the interior is a vast barracks, fifty feet long and
          thirty feet high. Rick looks around.
                         
                          RICK
                          (IMPRESSED)
           Great use of the space.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I learned it all from Bob Vila.
                         
          BOB VILA walks up next to Elijah.
                         
                          BOB
           You know you could expose those
           rustic beams and put in a skylight
           over one weekend, Elijah.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Give it a rest, Bob!
                         
          He pushes Bob away into the freak house, gives Rick a goodbye
          wink and walks out the door.
                         
                         
          EXT. OUTHOUSE
                         
          Elijah pauses and looks at the tiny outhouse.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           One of these days I gotta put a
           shitter in there.
                         
          Bob Vila steps out of nowhere again, holding a Time-Life
          book.
           28.
                         
                         
                          BOB
           No problem. It's all here in my
           Beds and Bathrooms book, Elijah.
           And you pay nothing for thirt--
                         
          BONK! Elijah knocks him out cold with a ball-peen hammer
          from his tool belt.
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          It takes a few moments for Rick's eyes to adjust to the dim
          light. There's nobody in sight. The walls are lined with
          dark cubicles, stacked atop each other with walkways like
          prison cells. Rick staggers to his feet, and makes his way
          forward.
                         
                          RICK
           Ernie? Julie?
                         
                          ERNIE
           Over here, Coog.
                         
                          JULIE
           Are you alright?
                         
          Rick sees the vague outline of JulieErnie a few yards away.
                         
                          RICK
           I know that voice. That's the
           voice that said,
                          (MIMICS)
           "Cool, a freak show. Let's check
           it out!"
                         
                          JULIE
           What!? Oh sure, blame the woman.
           Typical.
                         
                          RICK
                          (MIMICS)
           "It's so real." Is this real
           enough for you? I'm friggin'
           Quasimodo!
                         
                          ERNIE
           Chill out, Coog. You're talking to
           the original tag team of ugly
           pukes. Step into the light.
                         
                          RICK
           Okay, here I come.
           29.
                         
                         
          Rick steps forward into a pool of light. Julie and Ernie are
          caught by surprise. Julie struggles to keep her composure.
          Ernie's repulsed.
                         
                          ERNIE
           ULP!
                         
          Ernie turns away and pukes on the floor. Julie soldiers on.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh geez... It's not so (GULP)
           revolting. After all, physical
           beauty is just a socially-enforced
           myth that we, uh, oh shit... ULPI
                         
          Julie turns away and pukes on the floor.
                         
                          RICK
                          (OFFENDED)
           Yeah, well, you're no Mona Lisas
           yourself. You're lucky I've got a
           strong stomach!
                         
           VOICE (O.C.)
           And you're lucky I don't BITE you!
           Heh heh heh heh ...
                         
          Rick wheels around to see JUAN THE DOG BOY, snickering behind
          him. Juan is a hairy young Mexican with a snout, dog ears,
          and canine teeth--Scrappy Doo with an attitude.
                         
          Rick assumes a threatening pose.
                         
                          RICK
           Get away from me you, you...
                         
                          JUAN
           Freak? Ha ha hahahaha!
           (he stares hard at Rick)
           I am Juan the Dog Boy, leader of
           the freaks.
                         
                          JULIE
           (walks up to them)
           Kind of the "top dog."
                         
          Juan scratches himself behind the ear with his hind leg.
                         
                          JUAN
           Welcome to Hell, Rick. Shake?
                         
          He extends a hand to Rick. Rick doesn't take it. He hears a
          slight RUSTLING noise from the direction of the cubicles, and
          turns to look around the apparently empty Freak House.
           30.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           No thanks. I don't plan on staying
           long. How many of you are there in
           here anyway?
                         
          Juan shrugs mischievously and sticks his snout in Rick's
          face.
                         
                          JUAN
           First, I have a question for you,
           Ricardo. Who starred in the film
           "International Velvet?"
                         
                          RICK
           Huh?
                         
                          JUAN
           Well, perhaps we should ask the
           Worm!
                         
          The top right cubicle lights up, revealing the WORM. He is a
          man with no arms and legs, and the wrinkly, slimy body of a
          worm. His face is learned-looking, with spectacles, a small
          goatee, and a pipe which he puffs on pompously.
                         
                          JUAN
           Tell us, Worm, who starred in
           "International Velvet?"
                         
          He puffs pensively on his pipe for a second.
                         
                          THE WORM
           Yes, yes ... very interesting...
           International Velvet... The
           perfectly appalling sequel to
           National Velvet, I believe. No
           dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever.
                         
                          JUAN
           Yes, Worm. But who was the star?
                         
          The worm takes a long, thoughtful drag on his pipe...
                         
                          WORM
           Olivia DeHavilland.
                         
                          JUAN
           Olivia DeHavilland... Rick, do you
           agree or disagree?
                         
                          RICK
           This is nuts. This is crazy...
           Besides, it was Tatum O'Neill.
           31.
                         
                         
                          JUAN
           Very good. It was Tatum O'Neill,
           now married to tennis star John
           McEnroe. Circle gets the square.
                         
          The lights come on in 9 of the center cubicles, silhouetting
          9 freaks in a full size HOLLYWOOD SQUARES 3 x 3 layout. The
          FREAKS applaud Rick's success. He's incredulous.
                         
                          OTHER FREAKS
           Yayyy!
                         
          Worm nudges an "0" into place in his cubicle, with some
          difficulty. He's not happy about being proved wrong.
                         
                          WORM
           Blast. O'Neill ... No talent
           ragamuffin...
                         
                          JUAN
           okay, JulieErnie, your turn. Who's
           it going to be?
                         
          As Juan names the freaks one by one, their square is
          highlighted, and they wave at Rick cheerily.
                         
                          JUAN (CONT'D)
           Nosey the Nose Man!
                         
          NOSEY is a man whose massive nose dominates his head. He
          blows into a huge hanky, and waves it wearily at Rick.
                         
                          JUAN (CONTD)
           Cowboy!
                         
          COWBOY is a young boy with cow-like features, a cowboy hat,
          cowboy clothes, and a full set of udders.
                         
                          JUAN (CONT-D)
           The Bearded Lady!
                         
          The BEARDED LADY is a big, tough, bearded man--in a blouse.
          He has lipstick, earrings, and tattoos on his muscular arms.
                         
                          BEARDED LADY
           (gruff and masculine)
           How ya' doin.
                         
                          JUAN
           Sockhead!
                         
          SOCKHEAD is a freak with a large button-eyed sock puppet for
          a head. He's munching cookies which ,spill uselessly out of
          his throatless sock mouth...
           32.
                         
                         
                          JUAN
           The Human Torch!
                         
          The HUMAN TORCH is a man engulfed in flames. He waves
          apathetically.
                         
                          JUAN
           Rosie the Pinhead!
                         
          ROSIE is a pinhead in dark sunglasses. She has a great bod
          jammed into a sexy dress. She smokes a cigarette demurely,
          and waves a small, arrogant big-star wave.
                         
                          JUAN
           The hideous Frog Man!
                         
          Frogman is just a guy in a scuba outfit. He strikes a
          threatening "monster" pose, then gives a friendly wave.
                         
                          JUAN
           And of course, in the center
           square, Mr. Paul Lynde!
                         
          Suddenly the lighting changes to flashing red horror lights
          with plenty of dark shadows. There's a horrific MUSIC STING
          and we ZOOM IN to a DECOMPOSING SKELETON in the center
          cubicle. Its eyeball drips out of the socket.
                         
                          JUAN
           Well JulieErnie, who will it be?
                         
                          ERNIE
           Call me old-fashioned, but I'll go
           with Paul Lynde.
                         
                          JULIE
           Don't be an idiot.
                         
          They argue back and forth, hitting and poking each other 3
          Stooges style. Juan turns to Rick.
                         
                          JUAN
           You see, Rick? Just because we're
           freaks doesn't mean we can't have
           some fun, huh?
                         
          Rick is overwhelmed by it all. He backs away.
                         
                          RICK
           Get away from me. Get away! I'm
           not like you. You hear me? I'm
           Ricky Coogan! I AM NOT A FREAK!
           33.
                         
                         
          The Freaks laugh in Rick's face. He storms off.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          ANOTHER AREA OF THE FREAK HOUSE--A LITTLE LATER
                         
          Rick sits in a corner, pondering his fate. Oddly, there's a
          shiny new Pepsi machine in this dingy corner of the Freak
          House. JulieErnie approach him.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Okay Coog, so I get twenty four
           hour access to T `n' A, and you
           look like a plate of rancid
           giblets. We're still pals, right?
                         
          Rick shoots him a look.
                         
                          JULIE
           All the freaks have gone through
           this anguish, Rick. At first, I
           was blinded by my anger. I admit
           it. I wanted to break your neck
           for getting me into this. But I
           got over it. Juan taught me to
           channel my anger for the common
           good.
                         
                          RICK
           It was your fault, anyway. You
           wanted to see the freak show.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (FURIOUS)
           I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!
                         
          She tries to wring his neck. Ernie helps. Rick glares at
          Ernie.
                         
                          RICK
           Ernie!
                         
                          ERNIE
           Oh... Sorry, Coog. For a second
           there, I was a total man-hater.
           Weird.
                         
          Julie regains her cool. She takes out a pamphlet, scribbles
          something on it, and hands it to Rick.
                         
                          JULIE
           Here. Take it.
                         
          Rick examines the cover. He reads it aloud.
           34.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           "So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak--
           Now What?"
                         
          There's an "8" scribbled on the pamphlet.
                         
                          JULIE
           we're in cubicle eight. Maybe
           later you'll be ready to talk.
                         
                          RICK
           Forget it. Not me. I'm not like
           those other god-forsaken animals.
                         
          He throws the-pamphlet to the ground, just as the Worm,
          Bearded Lady, and Sockhead approach. They sit down in a
          circle around him. The Worm looks down at the pamphlet and
          puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.
                         
                          WORM
           You're mistaken, Rick. You are
           exactly like us. We were all
           normal healthy folk before we made
           the fateful mistake of visiting

          The Worm, as an OXFORD PROFESSOR, is wandering around the
          grounds, taking notes and puffing on his pipe.
                         
           WORM (V.O.)
           I was a professor of lacrophylogy--
           er, the study of worms, of course.
           I came in search of the
           Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman
           terms, the fat pudgy worm. Mr.
           Skuggs said he had just such a worm
           in his shed. How could I have
           surmised that the specimen and I
           would ultimately prove to be one
           and the same?
                         
          We see professor Worm meet Elijah, and follow him into the
          lab. The smoke stack belches a plume of flames as we hear
          his off-camera screams. DISSOLVE back to..

                          WORM
           At first, the transformation was
           fabulous. I truly understood the
           worm's ethos like never before.
           But those early days of fascination
           are over. Now, in retrospect, I
           think the whole thing is a fucking
           headache. I'd sell my soul just to
           be able to wipe my own ass...
                         
          He sniffles a little, but manages to hold back the tears. We
          pan to Sockhead.

          A lanky TOURIST, obviously Sockhead in better days. He
          approaches Elijah.
                         
           SOCKHEAD (V.O.)
           Anyway, then Elijah turned me into
           a sock. That's it.

                          SOCKHEAD
           Sorry. I'm not much for stories.
                         
          The camera moves in on the BEARDED LADY.
                         
                          BEARDED LADY
           When I arrived here, I was nothing
           like I am now.

          The bearded lady (as a man) steps out of the cab of his
          eighteen-wheeler. He looks very much like he does now,
          except he has no lipstick or earrings.

           BEARDED LADY/MAN
           Now I know who I am. I can say,
           "Hey world. This is me. I'm a
           woman. And I like me."
                         
          The others look at the bearded man uneasily. The camera pans
          past the Bearded Lady, and moves in on an ordinary HAMMER
          lying on the ground.

          Happy music. The hammer is placed on a shelf by a friendly
          STOCKBOY. The music turns tense as Elijah appears and scans
          the shelf. He makes eye contact with the hammer, and smiles.
          He grabs the hammer roughly and shoves it in a plastic bag.

          The music turns to Psycho-like string stabs as Elijah uses
          the hammer to smash in a nail.

          Everyone looks at the hammer sympathetically. Rick turns
          away to wipe a tear from his eye.
                         
                          WORM
           You are one of us now, Rick.
           Whether you admit it or not. It's
           irrefutable.

           Yeah. Says you.
                         
          The worm shakes his head. The freaks turn and head back to
          their cubicles. Rick exchanges a look with Julie before she
          and Ernie turn and head off.

          Rick is left alone, staring pensively at the hammer.

           You're right.
                         
          He spots the pamphlet on the ground, picks it up, dusts it
          off. He opens it and begins to read, under the heading "1.
          It's Fun Being Ugly!"...
                         
          Rick closes the pamphlet, looks at the number "8" Julie
          scribbled, and nods with a sense of purpose. Standing up, he
          throws the hammer carelessly aside into the muck, and walks
          towards the cubicles.

          Rick walks past the cubicles. In one, the Bearded Lady knits
          a sweater... He reaches cubicle 8, and is about to speak
          when he hears Julie giggling. There is a man's voice, but
          not Ernie's. It's Juan.
                         
          Rick peeks around and sees Julie scratching Juan's belly. He
          licks her face happily, and she giggles with delight. Ernie
          is reading "The Woman's Room," trying not to notice all of
          this.
                         
          Rick watches, disgusted. He tears up the pamphlet, throws it
          to the ground, and storms off to find his own cubicle.
                         
          Ernie peeks at Julie and Juan continuing their foreplay.
          Juan stops abruptly.
                         
                          JUAN

          Ernie returns to his book. The camera PANS up to Rick's
          cubicle. He's sitting on his cot, distractedly whittling a
          log with his knife-like talon. He talks to himself, making
          sure to be loud enough for JulieErnie and Juan to hear.

          Rick looks up and sees a holographic image of Stuey Gluck
          floating in the air above him.

           AHH! A phantom troll!
                         
          He swings the log wildly at the hologram, but it keeps
          darting around, dodging the blows. Cowboy leans around the
          cubicle wall. He talks a lot like Gomer Pyle.

          Rick stops swinging, lamely pretends he was stretching, and
          ignores Stuey, who hovers around him.

          Cowboy smiles and ducks back into his own cubicle.

          features Stuey's story and his sketch of Rick.

           That's me!
                         
          Suddenly two GOONS in dark suits snatch the paper away from
          Stuey. They grab him and force him into a limousine.
                         
                         
          INT. LIMOUSINE
                         
          The Goons hold Stuey in between them.'He's terrified. we
          hear the low, menacing chuckle of the Laughing Man, who's off
          screen. The camera is his POV.
                         
                          LAUGHING MAN
           Heh heh heh heh hehh heh.

           Sure I wrote the article. But--
                         
                          LAUGHING MAN
           Ha-ha-ha!
                         
                          STUEY
           No. You've got it all wrong. I
           don't know anything about that.
           You gotta believe me.
                         
                          LAUGHING MAN
           Ho-ho-hahahaha hee hee hoohaaa!
                         
                         THE LIMO
                         
          cruises off down the street. We hear a POWER DRILL, Stuey's
          SCREAMS, and Laughing Man's hearty CACKLE from inside.

          INT. RICK'S CUBICLE - NIGHT
                         
          Rick has whittled his log down to a toothpick. He admires
          it, then leans over and fits it into an intricate three-foot
          scale model of the Eiffel Tower, made entirely out of
          toothpicks. The Human Torch walks by.
                         
                          HUMAN TORCH
           Wow, what a great model!
           (he points at a toothpick)
           But look, this one's crooked.
                         
          He reaches out to fix it and--WOOF! The whole model burns to
          a cinder. Rick looks at him hatefully.
                         
                          HUMAN TORCH
                          (STUPIDLY)
           Sorry.
                         
          Elijah steps into the freakhouse.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Alright, freaks! Get ready for the
           glamour! Get ready for the glitz!
           Get ready to be pelted with rotten
           vegetables, 'cause it's showtime!

          EXT. CARNIVAL TENT
                         
          Elijah, looking natty in his Ringmaster suit, stands at the
          entrance, barking to various people who are drifting in.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           It's grisly! It's revolting! It'll
           make you wish you were dead! And
           at just twelve bucks a head, you
           can bring all the kids!
                         
          We follow a KINDLY FATHER through the curtained entrance.
          OOF! He collapses, a knife embedded in his chest, revealing
          the total mayhem...
                         
          INSIDE THE TENT
                         
          The motley crowd (LOCALS, sleazy looking MOBSTERS, rogue
          BIKERS, wayward HIPPIES, and JAPANESE TOURISTS, etc.) is
          brawling and drinking and having a heck of a time.
                         
          Some small displays and a few carnival booths are set up
          around the sides of the tent. There's a "PETTING ZOO" where
          a KID is petting a two-tailed-no-headed dog. And there's a
          "HEAVY PETTING ZOO" where a GUY is french kissing a six-
          legged goat.
                         
          A CLOWN sits in a dunk tank, heckling the customers. The
          sign says "DUNK ME IN ACID!"
                         
                          CLOWN
           C'mon, my granny could throw better
           than you!
                         
          He's talking to an OLD LADY, who throws a baseball, hits the
          target, and dunks the clown into the foaming bath of carbolic
          acid. We hear his gurgling screams, then his bony hand
          reaches up out of the bath.
                         
          Elijah walks out on stage and looks at the rowdy audience.
          It's total mayhem.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (CALMLY)
           Quiet, please.
                         
          Everyone instantly sits down, shuts up, and looks up
          obediently at Elijah.
           43.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,
           you are about to witness a
           cavalcade of atrocities so
           horrific, I advise the more
           sensitive members of our audience
           to leave the premises.
                         
          Two SENSITIVE LOOKING MEN wearing sweaters draped over their
          shoulders politely get up and leave.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Tonight I'm proud to announce the
           addition of several new
           monstrosities to the show,
           including our star attraction, the
           Beast Boy--an untamed and highly
           dangerous ghoul who's liable to go
           nuts and kill us all at the drop of
           a hat.
           (impressed "oohs", "ahhs",
           and "cools" from the
                          AUDIENCE)
           But first up, prepare to behold an
           unspeakably repulsive yet
           heartwarming atrocity, Three Men
           and a Baby!
                         
          THREE MEN AND A BABY, all fused into a single multi-limbed
          freak, walks out onstage. One of its arms holds up a dirty
          diaper, and all the three men hold their noses and grimace.
          The audience breaks into warm-hearted laughter and applause.
                         
                         BACKSTAGE
                         
          The freaks mill around in the caged-in green room, guarded by
          Toad. Frogman, dressed in a magician's outfit over his
          wetsuit, holds an empty dove cage and searches the room,
          whistling for his missing dove. Nosey sneezes up a cloud of
          feathers. JulieErnie walk determinedly towards the adjacent
          Men's and Women's restrooms... BONK! They hit the wall
          between the two doors.
                         
          Rick is reading his "script", rehearsing his lines. He's
          wearing a cheesy "jungle" costume.
                         
                          RICK
           Arrrggg. I am Beast Boy. I will
           eat you. Arrrghh.
           (he throws down the
                          SCRIPT)
           I can't do this shit!
                         
          He peers through the bars, scanning the audience for signs.of
          a rescue party.
           44.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Damn it! What's keeping those
           guys?
                         
          The Worm creeps up behind Rick.
                         
                          WORM
           Something's troubling you, my boy.
           what is it?
                         
                          RICK
           Well, let's see. I've been
           kidnapped, hideously disfigured,
           imprisoned with a bunch of mutant
           freaks, my rescue party is M.I.A.,
           and this dialogue makes "Hey Dude
           Three" read like "Dr. Zhivago."
                         
                          WORM
           I think I know what you're going
           through. I too had an eating
           disorder. You see, I've always had
           a feverish obsession with pudding.
           And when I was a young lad...
                         
          Rick groans and looks out at the audience.

           And now a perennial favorite here
           at Freakland, ladies and gentlemen.
           I know you'll all enjoy the musical
           stylings of Rosie the Pinhead.
                         
          Rosie the Pinhead struts out wearing a sexy dress and holding
          a microphone. After the applause dies down, she whips off
          her sunglasses with a flourish, revealing her extremely goofy-
          looking crossed eyes. She wails incomprehensibly and bonks
          her head with the mic.

           EEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIEEEEEE...
                         
          A series of WIPES show bits of various acts as the evening
                         WEARS ON:
                         
                         ERNIE/JULIE
                         
          are doing a Vaudeville style stand-up routine while tap
          dancing.
           45.
                         
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey Julie, how many feminists does
           it take to screw in a light bulb?
                         
                          JULIE
           How many?
                         
                          ERNIE
           Two. One to screw it in and one to
           ride my Rodney! Ha-ha-ha!
                         
                          JULIE
           Oaf!
                         
          She bonks him with their cane. He bonks her back. She
          knocks him cold. They both fall down.
                         
          THE BEARDED LADY
                         
          is doing a make-over demonstration. He's got a local GIRL
          from the audience sitting at a makeup table onstage.
                         
                          BEARDED LADY
           If your coloring is in the autumn
           range, like Maria's, try an earth
           tone eye makeup. Now I've done a
           lovely French braid on Maria, but I
           encourage everyone to experiment
           and use your imagination. The main
           thing is to just have fun with it.
                         
          The audience is engrossed. Some take notes.
                         
                         SOCKHEAD
                         
          is ringing those "tuned bells" and singing along.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD
           Edelweiss, Edelweiss.
                         
          He takes a bow but his sock is snagged on the mic stand. It
          pulls off and reveals a normal-sized hand where the sockhead
          was--he's actually a hand-head! The audience gasps. A MAN
          gets up and points accusingly.
                         
                          MAN
           He's got a hand under there!
                         
                          SOMEONE ELSE
           It's a hoax!
                         
          Sockhead realizes he's unveiled and tries to hide his hand-
          head with his other hands. The crowd starts jeering and
          pelting Sockhead with rotten vegetables. He gives them the
          finger with all three hands. Elijah tries to calm them.
           46.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Puppetteering is an admirable skill
           in its own right! Give him his
           due!
                         
                          THE CROWD
           Where's the beast boy you promised
           us!? Bring on the beast boy! We
           want the beast boy! (etc.)
                         
                         BACKSTAGE
                         
          The Worm is still talking to Rick. We can hear the crowd
          screaming for him in the background.
                         
                          WORM
           And when I won first prize, they
           never called me pudding-head again.
                         
                          RICK
           So?
                         
                          WORM
           Don't you see? You must turn your
           hardship into inspiration! You're
           an actor, Rick! Your body is your
           instrument, and with it you must
           play your tragic symphony for all
           the world!
                         
          Rick is really moved. Elijah pokes his head backstage.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (TO RICK)
           They're going nuts for you, Beast
           Boy! You better go out there now!
                         
          He starts to take off his jungle costume.
                         
                          RICK
           (determined, inspired)
           I'll be right there.
                          (TO WORM)
           Thank you Worm. I don't really
           know how I can repay you for this.
                         
                          WORM
                          (SINCERE)
           You could wipe my ass.
                         
                          RICK
           (thinks Worm is joking)
           Ha-ha! Always the wit, eh Worm?
           47.
                         
                         
          Rick claps him on the back and walks off. Worm is
          disappointed.
                         
                          WORM
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Damn.
           (he turns to Nosey)
           Nosey, have I ever told you what a
           gifted artist you are?
                         
          Nosey gives him a worried look.
                         
                         ONSTAGE
                         
          The spotlight reveals Rick, centerstage, poised in
          Shakespearean garb. The crowd quiets down and focuses on
          Rick with great respect and awe. A truly dramatic silence.
          Rick pauses for effect and then launches into a soliloquy
          with bravura.
                         
                          RICK
           Now is the winter of our
           discontent,
           Made glorious summer by this son of
           York,
           But I that am not shaped for
           sportive tricks,
           Nor made to court an amorous
           looking glass,
           I, that am curtailed of this fair
           proportion,
           Cheated of feature by dissembling
           nature,
                         
          The audience is riveted. Even Spanish-speaking peasants are
          mouthing the words. Elijah, however, thumbs through his
          script, totally confused. The freaks watch through the bars
          from the wings--completely engrossed, especially Julie. Juan
          notices this and pulls her closer to him, but she pushes him
          away.
                         
          We move in on an erudite British gentlemen in the crowd. By
          God! It's ALISTAIR COOKE! He turns to camera. Subtitle:

           If you're having trouble
           understanding Mr. Coogan's
           brilliant reading of this soliloquy
           from Richard the Third, please take
           advantage of the handy subtitles
           for the culturally illiterate.
           48.
                         
                         
          A FILTHY PEASANT sitting next to Cooke is trying to listen to
          Rick. He turns angrily to Cooke.
                         
                          FILTHY PEASANT
           SHHH!
                         
          Cooke turns back to the stage. The words in brackets appear
          as SUBTITLES.
                         
                          RICK
           Deformed, unfinished, sent before
           my time,
                          {I'M UGLY}
           Into this breathing world, scarse
           half made up,
           {I'M REALLY UGLY}
           And that so lamely and
           unfashionable, That dogs bark at me
           as I halt by them.
           {I'M F KIN' BUTT-UGLY, ALRIGHT!?}
           Why I, in this weak piping time of
           peace,
           {BLAH, BLAH, BLAH}
           Have no delight to pass away the
           time,
           {I NEVER GET LAID...}
           Unless to see my shadow in the sun,
           And descant on mine own deformity!
           {BECAUSE I'M UGLY}
                         
          Rick bows. The crowd bursts into applause. They yell
          "Bravo" and throw bouquets. Rick takes several curtain
          calls. The freaks cheer for him. Julie is particularly
          moved--she and Rick exchange a heavy look, laden with
          romantic potential. NOTE: We will insert an almost
          subliminal one-frame shot of the Pepsi logo at this
          triumphant moment.
                         
          Kevin, the EES executive from the airport scene, walks into
          the tent. Rick sees him and gasps with joy. He leaps off
          the stage, runs up to Kevin and hugs him. Kevin is shocked,
          of course. Overcome by the moment, Rick regresses to his old
          self.
                         
                          RICK
           I'm saved! Haha! You sorry
           mutants are gonna rot in this hole
           while I'm sipping mint juleps by
           the pool!
           {AS FORTUNE SMILES O'ER MY FATE, SO
           DESTINY SPURNS YOUR ACCURSE'D PATE}
                         
          The freaks and the audience gasp at Rick's cruelty. Julie is
          shocked--Juan gives her an "I told you so" look. Rick sees
          Julie and catches himself.
           49.
                         
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO KEVIN)
           I mean, um, I hope you have room
           for all my friends, heh-heh.
                         
                          KEVIN
           Rick, Rick, listen, I really love
           this new look you've come up with.
           But just between you and me, I
           don't think the guys upstairs would
           really get it.
                         
                          RICK
           What are you saying!?
                         
                          KEVIN
                          (CHUCKLES SNIDELY)
           I'm saying you're ugly enough to
           burn the nosehairs off a dead nun.
                         
          The crowd bursts into cruel hysterics, pointing mockingly at
          Rick. Even Alistair Cooke is practically choking with
          laughter.
                         
                          ALISTAIR COOKE
           AH-HA-HA-HA! WHAT A PUTZ!
                         
          Rick looks around, horrified at the sea of evil, jeering
          faces. He begins to tremble. Then...
                         
          RICK'S MONSTER EYE
                         
          springs to life for the first time and glows red with rage.
          His whole monster side awakens and takes charge of his body
          with violent intensity. He grabs Kevin's head and screams in
          a new, monstrous voice.
                         
                          RICK
           EAT SHIT!
                         
          POP! He plucks Kevin's head off his neck and holds it aloft.
          The head stares down at Rick in disbelief.
                         
                          KEVIN'S HEAD
           Now you're just being childish.
                         
          Rick serves the head like a volleyball, smashing it to bits.
          The crowd panics and charges for the exits.
                         
                          CROWD
           AHHHHHH! HELP! LET US OUT OF
           HERE!
                         
          People are trampling over each other in the mayhem. Alistair
          Cooke is crushed under the stampede.
           50.
                         
          The freaks are horrified. Monster Rick growls triumphantly.
          Elijah looks on, intrigued.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Now that's entertainment.
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          Rick awakens with a start and gets up. He approaches
          JulieErnie, The Bearded Lady, Nosey and Dog Boy, who are idly
          playing a game of "Wheel of Fortune." The cubicles contain
          large blank blocks, like the "letters" on the game show. So
          far, there's a "D", two "S"s, and a "K" revealed. Rosie the
          Pinhead plays Vanna White's role.
                         
                          NOSEY
           I'd like to buy a vowel.
                         
          The Bearded lady yawns. Rick edges towards them.
                         
                          RICK
           Hey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in?
                         
          Juan advances towards Rick, sneering.
                         
                          JUAN
           So. Now you don't mind mixing with
           us--how did you say it--sorry
           mutants?
                         
                          RICK
           Look! I'm sorry for what happened
           at the show. Can't you just forget
           it?
                         
          He shakes his finger at Juan, and notices there's still a
          human nose stuck on his monster claw. He wipes it off,
          embarrassed. There's an awkward pause. Ernie breaks the
          silence.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about
           your big escape plan?
                         
          Juan gives Ernie a nasty "shut up" look. He growls at him.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Well, excuse me for living.
                         
                          RICK
           You have an escape plan?
                         
                          JUAN
           Listen, Beast Boy, the games are a
           simple diversion.
                          (MORE)
           51.
                          JUAN(CONT'D)
           Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks
           cry out for freedom!
           Aooooooorrraaaagh!
                         
          Juan howls lustily. He looks to rest of the freaks. They're
          a pathetic lot, and their half-hearted howl proves it.
                         
                          FREAKS
           Aoo...
                         
          Beat.
                         
                          JULIE
           Juan's plan is really ingenious
           Rick. See, he figured out that--
                         
                          JUAN
           I figured out that our escape does
           not include the Beast Boy. No one
           may discuss the plan with him,
           understand?
                         
          Juan gives the others a threatening look. They mumble
          agreement.
                         
                          RICK
           What's the matter with all of you?
           You trust your lives to a guy just
           'cause he can lick his own
           privates?
                         
          The freaks ponder this a second, then nod "yes".
                         
                          ERNIE
           You gotta admit, Coog, it's a
           helluva trick.
                         
                          RICK
                          (RESENTFUL)
           Fine! I'll just come up with an
           escape plan of my own then.
                         
                          JUAN
           Haha! I have spent a year studying
           this hellhole, devising the perfect
           escape. You think you'll just
           tango right out the door!? Ha!
           Just try it, amigo.
                         
                          RICK
           I will!
                         
          Rick turns to go. JulieErnie rush over and try to reason
          with him quietly.
           52.
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           Rick, wait.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Yeah. Don't go off half-cocked.
           Believe me, it ain't all it's
           cracked up to be.
                         
                          JULIE
           This isn't one of your dumb movies,
           Coogan. Look, Juan's a good dog, a
           smart dog. I'll talk to him.
           Don't be stupid, Rick. You can't
           do it without us.
                         
                          RICK
           Forget it! I don't need you, EES,
           or anybody else! I'll get out of
           here all by myself, you... you.,.
           crud sucking pus monkeys!
                         
          DING DING DING! The letters in the Wheel of Fortune board
          light up, and ROSIE turns them over to reveal "Crud Sucking
          Pus Monkeys" as the secret phrase. Everyone claps despite
          themselves. Juan stares them down. They stop.
                         
          Rick storms off in a huff. Juan takes Julie's hand and gazes
          deep into her eyes. He kisses her passionately. Julie is
          watching Rick leave. Juan nibbles her neck, which gets her
          attention. She scratches Juan behind his ear. His leg
          instinctively kicks the air. Ernie looks worried.
                         
                          ERNIE
           I'm getting a bad feeling here.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. REAR CORNER OF FREAK HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Out of sight from the others, Rick approaches the rear door
          and tries it. It doesn't open from the inside.
                         
                          RICK
           Damn.
                         
          He peers out through a crack in the door and sees a MILKMAN
          getting out of his truck in the driveway.
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO MILKMAN)
           Psst! Hey, you. Milkman!
           53.
                         
                         
                         OUTSIDE
                         
          The milkman looks over at the outhouse, suspicious.
                         
                          MILKMAN
           Yeah... ?
                         
           RICK (V.0.)
           Just the man I'm lookinq for. Be a
           pal, and give me a hand will ya?
                         
                          MILKMAN
           Oooh no! I know you freaks.
           You'll try anything just to get
           someone to open that door. Well
           not me! Ha!
                         
          He's about to walk away.
                         
                          RICK
           Okay. Guess I'll just have to milk
           the world's biggest breasted woman
           all by myself. Sorry to bother
           you.
                         
          The milkman stops in his tracks. He tiptoes over to the back
          door of the outhouse, listening intently as Rick goes into
          his "act."
                         
                          RICK
           (in a lusty womanish
                          VOICE)
           Ooohh... Milk me! Milk me now!
           Milk me hard!
           (Normal Rick voice)
           I've only got two hands, all right?
           Geez. I don't care if Elijah did
           give you skim milk on the right
           side, chocolate on the left, and
           eggnog in the middle.
                         
          The milkman is salivating at the door.
                         
                          MILKMAN
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Gee, I love eggnog!
                         
          The milkman opens the door eagerly and steps inside. Beat.
                         
                          MILKMAN
           Hey, what the--
                         
          BONK. We hear the sound of bottled buttermilk beaning his
          soft noggin. Rick walks out wearing the milkman outfit
          complete with the little six-milk-bottle-carrier thing.
           54.
                         
          He looks around and heads for the milk truck, whistling
          casually. He notices something. It's ...
                         
          THE GIANT ELIJAH HEAD
                         
          Its big eyes are staring at Rick (note: there's a skywriter
          plane in the distance behind the head, which finishes writing
          "YOU GOT THE RIGHT ONE BABY: PEPSI") Rick gets to the truck
          and tries the door. It's locked.
                         
                          RICK
           Shit.
                         
          He looks over at the giant head. The eyes are still staring
          at him--they seem to have shifted. Rick shrugs it off and
          looks around. He walks over to Elijah's car. It's locked
          too. He checks the big eyes. They've moved again.
                         
          Rick's getting a bit desperate. He sees something else and
          runs towards it. It's a dry-docked motorboat. It's locked
          too. The eyes have followed Rick again. He sees something
          else and runs over to it. It's a bag of golf clubs leaning
          against Elijah's porch. They're locked too.
                         
                          RICK
           Damn! This guy doesn't trust
           anybody!
                         
          He looks at the giant head- the eyes are gone, leaving only
          empty eyesockets! Rick hears A BURST OF MACHINEGUN FIRE
          behind him, spins around and faces ...
                         
          TWO THREE FOOT HIGH EYEBALLS
                         
          with little arms and legs, wearing Jamaican Rasta hats and
          aiming smoking Uzi 9mms in the air. They aim their Uzis at
          Rick. One holds a walkie-talkie, the other holds a big
          spliff.
                         
                          RICK
           AHHHH!
                         
          A T.V. MONITOR in Elijah's hands, shows Rick staring at us,
          the Eye's POV.
                         
                         ELIJAH
                         
          seen in extreme close-up, watches the surveillance monitor.
          He speaks into a microphone. We don't see what the room
          looks like.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Good work, Eye and Eye.
           55.
                         
                         
                         THE EYES
                         
          bob in response to Elijah. They have no mouths, but their
          pupils open and close when they speak.
                         
           EYE AND EYE
                          (JAMAICAN ACCENTS)
           Rastafari.
                         
           ELIJAH (V.0.)
           (over the walkie-talkie)
           Now bring the Beast Boy to my, uh,
           den. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
                         
          Rick looks worried as they lead him towards the scary looking
          house.
                         
                         
          INT. ELIJAH'S DEN
                         
          It's a lovely, suburban den with a coffee table full of
          magazines like "Better Homes and Gardens," "National Review"
          and "Freaks Illustrated". Elijah sits in a big Barcalounger,
          smoking a pipe. Rick sits on the sofa. Toad walks up with a
          tray of soft drinks.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (TO RICK)
           Diet soda?
                         
                          RICK
           No thanks.
                         
          Elijah points to a bowl of Fiddle Faddle. Toad sits beside
          Rick.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Fiddle Faddle?
           (Rick shakes his head)
           You sure?
                         
                          RICK
           Well, okay.
           (he scoops some into his
                          MOUTH)
           Well, are you gonna torture me or
           kill me or something?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Torture my greatest creation ever!?
           Kill the final piece of the puzzle
           that I've been putting together for
           years!? Sure, it'd be fun, but
           I've got a bigger plan, my boy.
                          (MORE)
           56.
                          ELIJAH(CONT'D)
           And when you ripped off that guy's
           head, I knew it was working like
           gangbusters!
                         
                          RICK
           But I thought I scared everyone
           away.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Uh-huh. And then they told two
           friends, and they told two friends,
           and so on, and so on. Look at
           this.
                         
          Elijah grabs a big mail bag and spills some letters out on
          the table. Elijah opens one and reads it.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (READING)
           Dear Mister Skuggs, I was shocked
           and disgusted when my grandson told
           me about the head-popping beast at
           your show. Please send me six
           tickets.
           (he reads another)
           Dear Beast Boy, I used to like New
           Kids on The Block, but you're way
           cuter. My favorite ice cream is
           chocolate. Is it fun ripping
           people's heads off? I love you.
                          (ANOTHER LETTER)
           The Beast Boy is on a blood-letting
           spree, and Oscar is along for the
           ride!
           (he looks up at Rick)
           That one's from Pat Collins!
                         
                          RICK
           Yeah, but she loves everything.
                         
          Rick reaches for the Fiddle Faddle but the bowl is empty.
          Toad BURPS.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Toad! That Fiddle Faddle is for
           guests only! You've had enough!
                         
          Toad is blankfaced. Elijah walks over and refills the bowl.
          Rick scoops some into his mouth. Elijah walks to the
          fireplace and pushes the embers around with a poker.
                         
                          RICK
           Look Skuggs--Elijah--I've been in
           show business all my life. The
           public does not want to see
           disgusting, depraved violent filth.
           57.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Oh, and I suppose Jake and the
           Fatman is just a fluke?
                         
          The phone rings. Elijah looks at it, and back to Rick.
                         
                          ELIJAH (CONT'D)
           I'll get it.
                         
          He goes over to the phone and lifts the receiver.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           `Yello?
                         
          On the other end of the line, we hear LAUGHING MAN's insane
          chuckle. Elijah's smooth smile fades. He turns his back to-
          Rick, who strains to identify the familiar laughing voice.
          Elijah scribbles notes on a pad by the phone.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Yes... Right... Tomorrow...
           Mmhmm... Mnunhmm... Wow. Okay.
           You got it... Hasta la vista to
           you too. Hahaahahaahaha--
                         
          Laughing Man hangs up on Elijah. He looks a little pissed-
          off as he turns to face Rick again. Grumbling, he takes the
          poker in hand, and pokes at the coals angrily.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Okay, Coogan. I'm finished with
           you for now.
                         
          Ricky rises and snatches the notepad just before Elijah spins
          to face him.
                         
                          ELIJAH (CONT'D)
           But listen. I may not be "Mr.
           Tinseltown", but I damn well know
           what I like. You're gonna be a
           hideous killing machine, and that's
           final! Tomorrow night I'll finish
           the job onstage! And then, to
           demonstrate your horrible power,
           you'll slaughter all the old
           obsolete freaks in cold bl--HEY!
                         
          Elijah thrusts the red hot fire poker out and ZAP! He
          catches Toad's ten foot tongue--curled around the searing
          poker inches from the Fiddle Faddle.
                         
                          TOAD
           AAAGGGGHH!
           58.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I told you enough!
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. ELIJAH'S HOUSE DAY
                         
          Elijah shows Rick out the door. The Eyes scurry out and leap
          back into the sockets in the giant head.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Bye-bye. And remember, try another
           escape, and I'll feed your balls to
           Toad.
                         
          As he walks towards the Freak House, Rick pulls out the note
          he pocketed. A gust of wind blows it away from him. He
          chases it behind the carnival tent where...
                         
          KKCCLIINNK! He runs into ELEVEN PHONY MILKMEN, backing their
          way around the corner, each carrying their own six-pack of
          milkbottles. Startled, they turn around. Why, it's the
          freaks! And they're all dressed as milkmen! Cowboy carries
          the hammer, who's dressed in a little milkman suit as well.
                         
                          BEARDED LADY
           Hey Rick, I thought you were gonna
           come up with your own escape plan?
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO JUAN)
           This is your big plan? A dozen
           milkmen? Isn't that a little
           unusual?
                         
          Juan hadn't thought of this. He pushes himself forward and
          confronts Rick viciously.
                         
                          JUAN
           Twelve milkmen is theoretically
           possible. Thirteen is silly.
           Looks like one milkman too many,
           Coogan.
                         
          He pushes Rick aside. The freaks continue past him.
                         
                          RICK
           Fine then. Go ahead. Hope you
           like reggae, ya flea bitten
           bastard.
                         
          Rick watches as the Freaks approach the open courtyard, where
          he knows the Eyeballs will spot them.
           59.
                         
          Julie glances at him a second, then looks away. His mind
          made up, Rick takes a deep breath.
                         
                          RICK
           Ah, shit.
                         
          He runs over to the Freaks. He stands in Juan's way.
                         
                          RICK
           Look, you'll all be killed. You
           don't know about Elijah's giant
           Rasta eyeballs with machine guns...
           (they think he's nuts)
           It's suicide! I can't let you do
           it.
                         
                          JUAN
           And I can't let you stop us.
                         
          This is it. Rick and Juan square off. Juan growls and bares
          his teeth. Rick's MONSTER EYE starts to glow and pulse
          dimly. They circle each other. The others are transfixed.
                         
                         ELIJAH'S POV
                         
          He peers through a side window, and sees the pack of milkmen
          cheering two of their coworkers, locked in mortal combat.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           That's a lot of milkmen on the same
           route. No wonder they fight.
                         
          Juan rears back, about to lunge, when suddenly he freezes and
          looks off into the distance.
                         
                         A SQUIRREL
                         
          is sitting innocently a few yards off.
                         
                          JUAN
           Squirrel!
                         
          He zooms off after the squirrel. The Eyes pop out of the
          giant head and follow after him, Uzis FIRING. Juan dodges
          their bullets and disappears after his prey.
                         
          The freaks watch their best chance of freedom run off after a
          pesky rodent. They turn to Rick.
                         
                          NOSEY
           Wow, giant Rasta eyeballs, just
           like Rick said.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD
           Gosh, if it wasn't for Rick, we'd
           all be dead!
           60.
                         
                         
                          OTHER FREAKS
           Yeah! Way to go Rick! Alright!
                         
                          ERNIE
                          (TO JULIE)
           God, I can't believe he left you
           for a squirrel. What a dick.
                         
          Julie's hurt. She doesn't even smack Ernie.
                         
                          RICK
           You know how men are. Besides, it
           was a pretty good looking squirrel.
                         
          Julie looks at Rick. She sees he's trying to be helpful, not
          sarcastic.
                         
                          JULIE
           (to the others)
           Come on. You heard the Beast Boy.
           Back to the Freak House, now.
                         
          Her eyes meet Rick's. She manages a smile, and Rick smiles
          back. Ernie sizes up the situation and groans as they all
          head back to the Freak House.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Not again.
                          (TO RICK)
           Oh well, at least we'll get to try
           a new position.

          INT. STARK INTERROGATION ROOM
                         
          We're moving in towards a door in this desolate, vaguely
          corporate looking hallway.
                         
          INSIDE THE ROOM
                         
          We're looking at the back of Laughing Man's leather chair.
          We hear his CACKLE, as well as STUEY GLUCK'S TORTURED SCREAMS
          and a horrible POWER TOOL NOISE. We can see the usual bright
          interrogation spotlight, and a couple of extra GOONS watching
          the goings on, but Stuey and his actual torturer are hidden
          by Laughing Man's chair.
                         
           STUEY (O.S.)
           AHHHHH! STOP IT! OOOWWWWW!
                         
          We move past Mr. Big's chair to reveal Stuey lying face down
          on a table, while Bob Vila is using a power sander on his
          butt. Bob is happily giving pointers to the two goons.
           61.

           Notice the way I use an elliptical
           motion to chafe Stuey's buttocks.
           (the Goons nod
                          ATTENTIVELY)
           It's all here in my new book:

           A-HA-HA-HAHA-HA-HA-HA!
                         
          Bob obediently shuts up. Laughing Man directs a sinister low
          chuckle to Stuey.
                         
                          STUEY
           No way. I'll never talk! I'm made
           of stone!
                         
          Bob considers this a second, then starts up a jackhammer.
                         
                          STUEY

          We hear LONESOME HARMONICA MUSIC as we pan past the cubicles.
                         
          Cowboy is playing the harmonica... The Bearded Lady unties
          the pretty pink ribbon in his hair and sets it aside...
                         
          Suddenly, we switch to HORRIFIC PSYCHO STINGS as the camera
          picks up PAUL LYNDE'S CORPSE with flashing red lights. His
          eyeball drips out of the socket again...
                         
          Then it's back to the SAD HARMONICA MUSIC. In the next
          cubicle, Ernie is sleeping, Julie is awake, dreamily fondling
          a large eclair. She looks longingly up towards Rick's
          cubicle as we...

          Rick sits in his cubicle, visibly sickened by his daydream.
          Stuey's echoey voice drifts in.

          A holographic image of Stuey lying on the torture table
          appears over Rick. We can see the jackhammer looming over
          Stuey's face. Rick looks alarmed.

          spinning in his head, he takes the crumpled piece of paper
          out of his pocket and reads it.

          JULIE/ERNIE'S CUBICLE
                         
          Julie and Ernie are struggling over a bottle of deodorant.

          He hands her the notepaper. She reads it, with some
          difficulty. Ernie is still gagging on deodorant.

           And I've got a plan.
                         
          ANOTHER THRILLING CHORD.
                         
                          NOSEY
           I still say we kill him.
                         
          Sockhead nods again.
                         
                          RICK
           If we can get into Elijah's lab,
           maybe we can--
                         
                          WORM
           Of course! Design a super freak of
           our own and manipulate the genetic
           code to make him destroy Elijah
           instead of us! Brilliant!
                         
                          RICK
           Oh. Well--
                         
                          BEARDED LADY
           But how do we get to the lab?
                         
                          RICK
           Um, maybe--
                         
                          COWBOY
           Right! The worm could dig a
           tunnel!
                         
                          WORM
           By God, it's so crazy it might just
           work!
                         
                          ERNIE
           But you need Noxon 24 to make the
           freaking sludge, and Elijah told us
           himself he's run out of it.
                         
                          RICK
           Oh. Oh yeah. Well, see, what I
           was going to say was--
           66.
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           Yes! Exactly! If they've been
           using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer
           here, the entire ecosystem must be
           soaked with it! All we need is a
           way to extract it from the
           vegetation, ideally into a liquid
           form.
                         
                          RICK
           Right. Well, what about--
                         
                          COWBOY
           Golly! So that's why my milk comes
           out that funny green color! I
           thought the grass tasted funny!
           Wow, Rick, you're a genius!
                         
                          JULIE
                          (SMILES WARMLY)
           Good thinking, Rick.
                         
          The freaks all nod in agreement.
                         
                          NOSEY
           Way to go, Rick! How did you ever
           think of such a plan?
                         
          Rick pulls out an old comic book and points to an ad for Sea
          Monkeys.
                         
                          RICK
           Well, actually, I was going to
           suggest we send away for sea
           monkeys, train them to fire guns,
           and make a break for it. But if
           you want to go with this other
           thing, I guess that's okay.
                         
          The freaks stare at him, not sure if he's kidding or not.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          FREAKS ON A MISSION MONTAGE, SET TO A POUNDING "EYE OF THE
          TIGER"-TYPE SONG
                         
          -Nosey milks Cowboy, squirting the glowing milk into a funnel
          which feeds into a crude still. The Torch heats the boiler.
                         
          -The Worm digs the tunnel. JulieErnie hand Rick pieces of
          wood which he puts into place as tunnel supports. They hand
          him Paul Lynde's corpse and he wedges it in as well.
           67.
                         
                         
          -Everyone's getting into it and working up a sweat. Nosey
          wipes his brow, opens a bottle of Pepsi and chugs it down in
          a beautifully lit slo-mo product shot... The other freaks
          follow suit, including the Worm, down in the tunnel, who
          struggles to hold the bottle in his tiny feeler.
                         
          Everything's going great and the song is really pumping
          when...
                         
                         ELIJAH
                         
          runs out on his front porch in his nightclothes and screams
          down at the outhouse.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           WOULD YOU TURN DOWN THAT GODDAMN
           RACKET!?
                         
          IN THE FREAK HOUSE
                         
          Nosey turns off a boom box and the music cuts short. The
          freaks exchange tense looks. Nosey calls out apologetically
          to Elijah.
                         
                          NOSEY
           SOR-RY.
           (to the freaks)
           What a jerk!
                         
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL
                         
          The Worm burrows along, leaving a tunnel wide enough for Rick
          and JulieErnie to crawl after him. Rick notices a ray of
          light coming through a rock formation.
                         
                          RICK
           Hey, look at this!
                         
          They all stop and look. Rick fingers the hole, and the rocks
          cave in, revealing
                         
          A VAST UNDERGROUND CITY
                         
          It's obviously a matte painting.
                         
                          WORM
           Good Lord! It's the Lost City of
           Nodd!
                         
                          JULIE
           Wow!
           68.
                         
                         
          KER-CHUNK! We hear the sound of a slide projector switching
          slides and the underground city is replaced by a still image
          of some tourists standing around a geyser. [foriegn version:
          the Blarney Stone].
                         
                          RICK
           It's Old Faithful! (foriegn take:
           "It's the Blarney Stone!"]
                         
          They "Ooh" and "Ahh". The image switches to a snapshot of a
          FAT MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.
                         
                          ERNIE
           It's my Aunt Gladys!
                         
          The other freaks nod politely. The image switches to a BAR
          MITZVAH PHOTO.
                         
                          ERNIE
           And that's me at my bar mitzvah!
                         
                          RICK
           C'mon Ernie, let's go.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Wait, you gotta see the ones from
           sleep-away camp! They're
           hilarious!
                         
          Julie smacks him.

           Stooge!
                         
                         
          EXT. FREAK COMPOUND - NIGHT
                         
          It's an "Antfarm View" of the yard, where the freaks are
          visible tunneling underground, and Toad is visible on the
          yard above them. We see a bat fly overhead... ZAP! Toad
          shoots out his tongue, snags it out of mid air, and chews it
          happily, oblivious to the freaks burrowing right underneath
          him.

          Nosey looks at the nearly full container of distilled Noxon.
                         
                          NOSEY
           Almost there.
           (he sniffs the air)
           But wait, I'm getting a whiff of
           things to come!
           69.

           Blood.
                         
          Bearded Lady looks grave..Nosey sniffs again.
                         
                          NOSEY
                          (CHEERFUL)

          They're burrowing along. Ernie loudly clears his throat.
          Julie spits out a loogie. She grimaces.
                         
                          JULIE
           I hate when you do that.
                         
          We hear muffled BARKING.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey! Do you hear that?
                         
                          JULIE
           It's a dog!
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO WORM)
           Hurry!
                         
          The Worm breaks through into a small cavern with several
          exposed sewer pipes. A lovable mutt leaps out of a pipe and
          drops an old tennis ball in front of Rick. He starts licking
          Rick's face.
                         
                          RICK
           Scrappy!
                         
          SAPPY MUSIC wells up.
                         
                          RICK
           It's been ten years since you
           chased this ball into the sewer! I
           thought you were gone for good!
                         
                          SCRAPPY
           Yap!
           70.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Listen Scrap. Go home. Get help.
           Understand?
                         
                          SCRAPPY
           Yap!
                         
                          RICK
           Good boy! Now go!
                         
          Scrappy runs away into the sewer pipe. Rick shrugs.
                         
                          RICK
           You never know.
                         
          Julie taps on some exposed wood on the cavern ceiling.
                         
                          JULIE
           Look, a wood floor.
                         
                          WORM
           It must be the lab! we've done it!
                         
          They all look at each other excitedly. Suddenly Elijah's
          voice rings out behind them.
                         
                          ELIJAH'S VOICE
           Not so fast, you scabrous freaks!
                         
          They spin around and see Nosey holding the bottle of Noxon
          24. He grins.
                         
                          NOSEY
           Didn't know I did impressions, did
           ya?
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          The freaks are waiting around the hole. Nosey pops out.
                         
                          NOSEY
           Mission accomplished. They've got
           the Noxon, and they'll be in the
           lab within minutes.
                         
                          FROGMAN
           Boy, this is going like clockwork!
                         
          Everyone smiles, pats each other on the back, etc. Except
          Sockhead, who finally snaps.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD
           No! Can't you see we're digging
           our own graves!?
                          (MORE)
           71.
                         
           It's nuts, SOCKHEAD(cont'd)
           that's what it is!
           Nuts! Well, maybe you've all got a
           deathwish, but you can count me
           out! I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT OF
           HERE!
                         
          He runs amok, pushes various freaks to the ground, and runs
          around screaming. The freak house door opens--Eye and Eye
          step in to check out the noise. One of them has a spliff
          sticking out of its pupil. Sockhead charges at them like a
          mad dog. They aim their Uzis.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD

           OUT OF MY WAY!
                         
          RATTA-RATTA-RATTA! They spray an ungodly amount of bullets
          into Sockhead. He falls to the ground. The Eyes leave.
                         
          The freaks gather around Sockhead. Nosey pulls the sock off
          his hand head, which is making a little "Senor Pepe" face
          with its fist. It spits up a trickle of blood and tries to
          speak.
                         
                          SOCKHEAD

           I... I... just... wanna...say...
                         
                          NOSEY
           What is it, kid?
                         
                          SOCKHEAD
           Ah, forget it. I'm not much for
           dying.
                         
          He goes limp.

          JulieErnie, the Worm, and Rick are just emerging from the
          hole. It's really dark in the lab.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Shit. I can't see a damn thing.
                         
                          RICK
           Keep your voice down, Ernie.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Don't push me, Coog. I got a real
           short fuse today. I'm cranky,
           bloated, got a wicked case of
           cramps. Don't ask why.

           PMS...
                         
                          RICK
           (has to think about this)
           Oh.... Right.
                         
          Rick pats Ernie on the shoulder reassuringly. He moves over
          to Elijah's computer terminal.
                         
                          RICK

           Well, here it is--the control panel
           for Elijah's Freaking process.
                         
                          WORM
           Good work, my boy. Now step aside.
           This is scientist's work.
                         
          Worm muscles Rick out of the way and sits at the console.
          Using a pen held in his mouth, he flicks a series of switches
          and punches a fast series of computer keys.
                         
          The light on top of the Tasty Freekz machine starts to
          revolve, and after a couple of seconds, a stream of GOOEY
          LIGHT BROWN GLOP oozes out of the spigot.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Hey! It's working!
                         
                          RICK
           You did it, Worm! Way to go!
                         
                          JULIE
           But how? You didn't even use the
           Noxon.
                         
          The Worm rushes over to the container of glop below the
          spigot, and without hesitation, plunges his face into it!
          Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp in horror!
                         
          The WORM lifts his glop-smeared face out of the bowl, and
          smacks his lips in delight.
                         
                          WORM
           Ah! You don't need Noxon to make
           Butterscotch pudding. I just
           wanted to test the machine's
           capabilities. Mmmm! Glorious! So
           creamy! Yum!
                         
          The Worm is lost in his pudding-induced reverie. They ignore
          him. Julie turns to Rick.
           73.
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           Hang on, Rick. Do you really think
           we should put this toxic glop on
           you? What if it doesn't work?
           What if something goes wrong? What
                          IF--
                         
                          ERNIE
           If it does work, do you think
           there'll be enough left over to
           give me a monster size rodney?
                         
          Julie goes to doink Ernie in the eyes, but he uses the
          classic "Three Stooges" handblock.
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO ERNIE)
           Here, hold this.
                         
          Rick hands the container of Noxon to Ernie. Julie gives him
          the eyepoke. Rick shakes hands with Julie, and takes back
          the Noxon.
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO ERNIE)
           Thanks.
           (to Julie, heroically)
           Look, I've been a freak all my
           life.' I realize that now. Up
           there on that screen, humiliating
           myself for every fool with six

           Sometimes seven fifty.
                         
                          RICK
           Alright. It doesn't matter.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Sure it does. They don't let you
           into the theater if you don't pay
           the price of the ticket.
                         
                          RICK
           Look, I'm talking about the
           ultimate human sacrifice.
                         
                          JULIE
           No kidding. When you consider
           money for parking, popcorn,
           drinks...

           Hey! In case you haven't noticed,
           I'm about to commit a noble and
           selfless act here.
                         
          Rick pounds the table, sending a glass beaker flying. It
          smashes through the window, setting off a loud SIREN.

          Elijah's in his robe, watching the opening of "Crooked Cops"
          on TV. On screen is a revolving police beacon on a beat-up
          car, with a loud SIREN. Elijah munches his popcorn happily.

          Julie manages to silence the alarm by yanking the cord out of
          its socket. She shoots Rick a hard look, he shrugs
          innocently.
                         
                          RICK
           Oops.

           Okay. Let's do what we came to do,
           and this time, no more screw ups.
                         
          Rick slams his hand down for emphasis and impales it on one
          of those desktop paper pins. He SCREAMS in agony.

          Elijah's watching an old war movie--a soldier is running
          across a battlefield with a bayonet, SCREAMING. He doesn't
          hear Rick.

          Julie has her hand over Rick's mouth, silencing his scream.
          He calms down. He gingerly slides the pin out of his hand,
          grimacing but not making a sound. He sighs with relief. The
          coast seems clear. Then, in SLOW MOTION, his hand knocks a
          styrofoam cup off the desk and onto the ground.

          The war movie has erupted into a massive battle--machine guns
          blaring, grenade launchers and bazookas booming, the works.
          Suddenly, his ears perk up, and his head swivels around
          towards the window.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Styrofoam cup?
                         
          He puts on his "smiley face" robe and bunny slippers and
          heads out the door.

           No. Here goes.
                         
          He presses some buttons on the computer, and the Tasty Freekz
          machine starts humming. Ernie is looking out the window.
                         
                          ERNIE

          an empty Pepsi cup under the Tasty Freekz spigot. A drop of
          ointment drips out and into the container.

          opening. Julie and Ernie get in the hole with Worm, while

          board over his head. The RUMBLING gets louder as the tunnel
          walls start to crumble.
                         
                          JULIE
           Rick! Come on!
                         
          Rick is losing his balance as the ground shifts beneath him.
          He sways, and knocks the Pepsi cup of sludge rolling. He
          watches, helpless, as it rolls across the floor and comes to
          a stop across the room. For a second, he contemplates making
          a dash.
                         
                         OUTSIDE
                         
          Elijah has wrapped his shirt tails around the knob, and
          finally has a good grip. He twists the knob...
                         
                         INSIDE
                         
          Rick sees the door opening. He dives down into the hole.
          The floor board falls into place just as Elijah walks in.
                         
          Elijah scans the room. He goes over towards the Tasty Freekz
          machine and finds the styrofoam cup.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Bad for the environment.
                         
          He crumples it in his hand.
                         
                         
          EXT. FREAK COMPOUND
                         
          The "antfarm view" again. We see the freaks running back
          through the tunnel as it caves in behind them. Toad sits on
          the ground above, oblivious to them. We hear a low flying
          aircraft... ZAP! Toad shoots his tongue up out of frame and
          sucks the twin engine Cessna into his mouth. Beat. He BURPS
          and spits up a propeller.
           78.
                         
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          The freaks wait by the mouth of the tunnel. We hear the
          rumble approach. The worm, JulieErnie, and finally Rick
          scramble out of the opening. The dirt avalanche is stopped
          short by Paul Lynde's corpse, just as Rick scrambles to
          safety.
                         
                          WORM
           Just made it!
                         
                          RICK
           Paul saved our lives!
                         
                          NOSEY
           Way to go, Paul!
                         
          Nosey claps Paul on what's left of his back--his skeleton
          shatters and the tunnel collapses, burying him instantly.
          The freaks are horrified.
                         
                         NOSEY
                         
          turns to them guiltily in SLOW-MOTION. His voice is slowed
          down and distorted like John Lennon at the end of "Strawberry
                         FIELDS":
                         
                          NOSEY
           I... buried... Paul.
                         
          Back to normal speed.
                         
                          RICK
           This is no time to lament over a
           cadaver! We've got to get moving,
           or we're history! Now c'mon!
                         
          Nosey is still morose. He speaks backwards and sounds a lot
          like "Revolution #9".
                         
                          NOSEY

           I said enough! Okay, listen up,
           everybody. We cracked the code and
           made the ointment we need to bring
           Skuggs down for good.
                         
          The freaks applaud and cheer.
           79.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           But we left it in the lab.
                         
          The freaks jeer and pelt Rick with rotten vegetables. He
          desperately pulls a bag of cookies out of his pocket.
                         
                          RICK
           But wait! I found some macaroons!
           And there's plenty for all of us!
                         
          The freaks burst into applause again.
                         
                          FREAKS

          INT. FREAK HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The Freaks are all sleeping, macaroon crumbs still left on
          their faces. There's a lot of snoring. Rick awakens with a
          start. He hears something in the distance. Something like a
          helicopter... He gets up and peeks out a crack in the wall.
                         
                         
          RICK'S POV. EXT. FREAKLAND - DAY
                         
          An EES corporate helicopter touches down. A few gun-toting
          SECURITY GUYS in dark suits and dark glasses get out. They
          check that the coast is clear, then give the signal. Out
          steps Richard Hertz. He mutters something to one of the
          security guys, and walks towards the Freak House.
                         
          IN THE FREAK HOUSE
                         
                          RICK
           (under his breath)
           I don't believe it. What's Hertz
           doin' here?
                         
          The door to the Freak House opens. Hertz enters, unzips his
          fly. Finding no toilet, he shrugs and relieves himself on
          the floor. Rick steps out of the shadows towards him.
                         
                          RICK
           So EES is in bed with Elijah C.
           Skuggs, eh? Figures.
                         
          Hertz is momentarily startled by Rick. He collects himself.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Rick! Thank God I got to you in
           time!
           80.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Cut the crap, Hertz.
                         
          Hertz relieves himself as he talks.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Ricky, you have no idea how your
           misfortune has touched our hearts.
           When you disappeared we almost gave
           up hope. But we'd heard reports of
           Skuggs's reckless abuse of Noxon,
           and when the story broke in the
           tabloids, I decided to personally
           come down and get to the bottom of
           things.
                         
          He zips up and heads to the door.
                         
                          RICK
                          (SKEPTICAL)
           Really?
                         
                          HERTZ
           No.
                          (BEAT)
           AHA HA HEE HEE HO HO HA HA HEE HEE
           HO HO HO HA HA HA HA!
                         
          The cackle is unmistakable--Rick's face twists in horror as
          he realizes... Hertz is THE LAUGHING MAN! Hertz ducks out
          the door. Rick looks after him, stunned.
                         
          We hear a nearby SNORE cut off, and the Human Torch stands up
          from the spot where Hertz relieved himself. He's dripping
          wet and no longer on fire. He sniffs his soaked, smoldering
          clothing.
                         
                          TORCH
           Peuw! Hey! Of all the... That
           really pisses me off!
                         
          POOF! He catches fire again and walks off. Rick is doing a
          slow burn, still looking after Hertz. He erupts and his
          monster eye glows briefly. He screams in anguish.
                         
                          RICK
           AAARRGGGGHH!
                         
          Dejected, Rick leans against the wall. JulieErnie walk up
          behind him. Julie puts a hand on Rick's shoulder to comfort
          him. As they look into each other's eyes, a loud CRASH
          distracts them. Rick peers through the crack.
           81.

          A caravan of EES trucks crash through the front gate and
          drive up to the lab. There's a few cargo trucks and a huge
          NOXON-24 tanker.
                         
                          RICK
           Holy shit.
                         
          A forklift drives out of the back of one of the large trucks,
          carrying the old corporate farts on a wooden palette.
                         
          One of them falls off, and a bunch of WORKMEN scramble out to
          prop him up and push him back into place.
                         
                         
          INT. LAB - DAY
                         
          Elijah switches on the lights, and turns to face his
          audience. Hertz is accompanied by his stone-faced security
          men and various executives. Workmen are busy installing the
          old board of directors and their arm-raising pulley system.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Nice to see you in the flesh,
           Laughing Man.
                         
                          HERTZ
           No need to use codenames, Elijah.
           We're all friends here. And just
           to prove it, I brought you a little
           present.
                         
          Hertz snaps his fingers and nods to a security guy, who
          produces a wriggling canvas sack. He dumps its contents onto
          the lab table--it's Stuey Gluck! His glasses come tumbling
          out after him. He squints at the security guy.
                         
                          STUEY
           Rick? Is that you?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Who's the troll?
                         
                          HERTZ
           He was asking questions about
           Coogan, causing trouble. We
           figured he was one of yours.
                         
          Stuey puts on his glasses. Elijah looks him up and down.
                         
                          ELIJAH

           yourself, mister.
                          (CALLS OUT)
           Rick! Riiiick! Riii--
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          Rick hears Stuey's voice in his head, all echoey.
                         
           STUEY(V.0.)
           --iiiiiick!
                         
                          RICK
           Oh no, not now, Stuey!
                         
          The ghostly image of STUEY gradually takes shape in front of
          Rick. Rick can make out the lab table Stuey's on, and some
          shadowy figures in the background.
                         
                          RICK
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Hey. That's Elijah's lab!
                          (TO STUEY)
           Stuey! Are you really in the lab?
                         
                         
          INT. LAB
                         
          Stuey is still wailing, and everybody else is getting pretty
          damn annoyed.
                         
                          STUEY
           Yes! I'm in the lab! I'm in the
           lab!

           Not only ugly, he's crazy too.
                         
          Toad grabs Stuey and slaps a piece of tape over his mouth.
          He throws him into one of the chicken cages along the far
          wall. A two-headed chicken starts to peck at him.
                         
                          HERTZ
           So, where were we?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Gentlemen, I'm not going to
           bullshit you. I know my setup here
           at Freakland looks like small
           potatoes.

          He pulls the cover off a small scale model of Freakland,
          about ten inches high. It shows the stage, lab, outhouse,
          the head, everything.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           But thanks to your Noxon and my
           genius, tonight I will turn Ricky
           Coogan into a freak so hideous,
           it'll be enough to turn your
           stomach inside out, boil your brain
           in its own juice, and cause cold
           sores you thought had healed up to
           start buggin' you again.
           (the EES men shift
                          UNCOMFORTABLY)
           It's the dawning of a new age for
           us all. Behold, Super Mega Freak
           World!
                         
          He whisks the cover off another scale model--it's exactly the
          same as the little model except it's a lot bigger.

           It's really somethin', huh?

          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          Rick is watching all of this in a ghostly image.
                         
                          RICK
           Stuey! Stuey, can you hear me?
                         
          Stuey's image, still with his mouth taped shut and the
          chicken pecking at him, nods yes.
                         
                          STUEY
           Mmm hmmm!
                         
                          RICK
           I want you to try and escape. Get
           the cup from underneath the
           instrument table and bring it to
           me, okay?
                         
                          STUEY
                          (NODS)
           Mmmm mmmmm!
           84.
                         
                         
          He gives Rick the old trademark Coogan thumbs up. Rick
          halfheartedly returns the gesture.
                         
                          RICK
           Yeah, right. Get movin'.
                         
                         
          INT. LAB
                         
          Stuey checks to make sure nobody's watching him. They're
          not. He removes the spring from a pocket pen and picks the
          lock. Stuey searches the floor, and spots the Pepsi cup.
          He'll have to crawl through several pairs of legs to reach
          it.
                         
                          HERTZ
           At EES, our plans for your Gene
           Machine include everything, except
           shoes that is. Ha-ha-ha.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Ha-ha. Gee, I'd love to see your
           plans.
                         
                          HERTZ
           We'd love to show you.
           (to his assistant)
           Bill, if you'd be so kind.
                         
          BILL BLAZER, a slick and dashing EES marketing executive,
          strides confidently up to the podium.
                         
          Stuey has to duck the fast approaching legs. Bill steps over
          him, not even noticing he's there.
                         
          Bill takes Elijah's "Freak World" graphic off an easel, and
          replaces it with his own. Finding no place to deposit
          Elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor. Elijah looks a
          little hurt.
                         
                          BILL
           What does today's businessman want?
           How about a receptionist with six
           arms, five mouths, and a knockout
           figure? That'd sure speed things
           up, wouldn't it?
                         
          With a big smile, Bill reveals an illustration of a multi-
          limb secretary (in a sexy dress) talking on three different
          phones, taking notes, and typing, all at once.
                         
          Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup. He brushes against the
          back of Hertz's legs. Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him,
          who smiles politely. Hertz smiles back, invitingly. Maybe
          there's a few things we don't know about him.
           85.
                         
                         
                          BILL
           In the factory, how 'bout a worker
           with twelve busy hands, no mouth to
           talk back, and no genitalia or
           digestive system to distract him
           from his work?
                          (HE CHUCKLES)
           Sure! It's what we all dream of!
                         
          The EES guys all nod along. Except for the workmen, who
          exchange worried looks. Elijah's still not sure what to make
          of it all.
                         
          Meanwhile, Stuey has the Pepsi cup of sludge in hand, and
          he's crawling under the table towards the door. He brushes
          up against the back of Elijah's legs.
                         
          Elijah looks over to Hertz, who gives him that smile again.
          Elijah looks away quickly, panicky.
                         
                          BILL (CONT'D)
           Well, with this Skuggs-based Noxon
           technology, it's not only possible,
           it's just the beginning! Of
           course, what happened to our
           expensive spokesman Ricky Coogan
           was an unfortunate coincidence, but
           profits from these new markets
           could total in the billions.
                         
          All the executives turn to Hertz. He cracks a smile.
                         
                          HERTZ
           Ricky who?
                         
          The executives laugh heartily. Stuey glances across the room
          to the door. He has to make a break for it, so he does.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Hey! Hold on!
                         
          Stuey freezes. He's right out in the open, in plain view.
          Still, nobody seems to see him. They're still watching-
          Bill's presentation.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Secretaries? Worker drones?
           Where's the fun? Where's the
           spark? Where's the unspeakable
           evil?
                         
          Bill laughs pleasantly.
                         
                          BILL
           Ha-ha. I was just getting to that.
           86.
                         
                         
          Bill launches back into his speech with more intensity than
          even the best infomercials. Meanwhile, Stuey inches towards
          the door, moving as imperceptibly as possible.
                         
                          BILL
           We'll impact every field.
                          COSMETICS--BREAST ENLARGEMENT
           creams, nosejobs in a bottle.
           Military--human death machines that
           make Schwarzenegger look like a
           pansy! And why stop at consumer
           products? Hell, we can design a
           whole new consumer! A few well
           placed drops in the water supply,
           and bingo! It's a new master race,
           and we own the copyright! An
           entire planet of freaks owned and
           operated by us! Every part of
           their bodies comes from an EES
           supplier, every thought they think
           is EES policy! From now on
           gentlemen, it's EES uber alles!
           EES uber alles!
                         
          The EES guys clap and shout approval. Elijah's impressed
          too. He leans over to Hertz.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           This guy's good.
                         
                          HERTZ
           We lured him away from A.T.&T.
                         
          Stuey is finally out the door. Of course, now they spot him.
                         
                          SECURITY GUY
           Look! The troll!
                         
                          HERTZ
           After him!
                         
                         
          EXT. LAB
                         
          Stuey is outside the lab. Inexplicably, (actually it's just
          because he's so stupid) he's still moving inch by inch. He
          calls to Rick through the tape on his mouth.
                         
                          STUEY
           Mmm! Mmmmm!
                         
                         
          INT. FREAK HOUSE
                         
          Rick sees the image of Stuey inching away from the lab.
           87.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Take the tape off your mouth,
           idiot! They didn't tie your hands!
                         
          Stuey realizes this is true, and pulls the tape off his
          mouth.
                         
                          STUEY
           I got the cup, Rick!
                         
                          RICK
           Great! There's no time to waste.
           Are you being followed?
                         
                          STUEY
           Yeah. But if I don't move, they
           won't see me.
                         
          Two big EES security guys are standing watching Stuey's odd
          behavior. They pick him up and carry him away.
                         
                          STUEY
           Riiiick!
                         
          Rick sees this all in his holographic image. It fades.
                         
                          RICK
           What a geek.
                         
          He turns to the other freaks, who've woken up and are
          gathered around on the floor. Rick shakes his head.
                         
                          RICK
           Stuey got caught. There's no way
           to get the ointment before the
           show.
                         
                          WORM
           So, that's it then? We're all to
           die... And by your hand no less.
                         
                          RICK
           No. It won't be me. It's some
           inhuman monster Elijah used me to
           create. As for me, the real me,
           I'll always be your friend. Before
           I have to rip your heads off, I'd
           like to say goodbye to each of you.
           (He turns to Worm.)
           Worm... I'll miss your brains, the
           smell of your pipe, and the funny
           way you always go on talking until
           everyone wants to strangle you.
                         
          He pats the Worm on the head tenderly, and turns to Cowboy.
           88.
                         
                         
                          COWBOY
           Hi, Rick.
                         
                          RICK
           Cowboy, I'll miss your good humor,
           your down-home wisdom, and of
           course, the frothy milkshakes were
           udderly delicious, heh-heh...
                         
          He smiles and playfully tugs Cowboy's udder. He turns to the
          Bearded Lady.
                         
                          RICK
           Bearded... Lady... I dunno.
           We'll always have Paris...
                         
          Bearded lady is kind of confused, Rick shrugs.
                         
                          RICK
           Nosey, I never really liked you.
                         
          He moves on to Frog Man.
                         
                          RICK
           Frog Man, I think death is probably
           the best thing for you now.
                         
          Frog Man nods in agreement. Rick rpaches JulieErnie.
                         
                          RICK
           Ernie... Julie... I have mixed
           feelings.
           (He turns to Ernie)
           On one hand, I'll remember you as
           the best friend a jerk like me ever
           had, and a low down repulsive
           slimeball.
                         
          He turns to Julie. ROMANTIC MUSIC swells up.
                         
                          RICK (CONT'D)
           On the other hand, I really respect
           you, and more than that, I, uh,
           well, I wish we'd had the chance to
           boink.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh, Rick...
                         
          They embrace. Rick calls out to the assembled group.
                         
                          RICK
           Today I make the proudest boast a
           man can utter: "Ich bien ein
           Freak!"
           89.
                         
                         
          They're all ready to cheer, but they're confused by his bad
          German. Rick has to explain himself.
                         
                          RICK
           Uh, I'm a freak.
                         
          Oh. They all get it. Beat. Then they cheer.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT..CARNIVAL TENT - NIGHT
                         
          A huge banner reads "NEW IMPROVED BEAST BOY SLAUGHTERS HIS
          LOVED ONES! SPECIAL GUEST: FUNNYMAN DOM IRERRA! TONIGHT
          ONLY!". We can hear the sound of the crowd inside.
                         
          INSIDE THE TENT
                         
          There's a typically smallish crowd in addition to the EES
          executives who occupy the front seats. The security goons
          are strategically situated throughout the tent, and two of
          them sit on either side of Stuey in the second row. Elijah
          is onstage.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           And now the moment you've all been
           waiting for. Ladies and gentlemen,
           meet the lucky young man who's
           about to be become the monster with
           the mostest! Here he is, the Beast
           Boy!
                         
          Toad pulls a rope and the curtain opens, revealing Rick
          strapped to an operating table. On stage left there's a
          large cage containing all the other freaks. Including the
          unconscious, half-naked Milk Man who Rick knocked out in the
          freak house. The Milk Man domes to, looks around in a panic,
          grabs the bars of the cage, and screams--
                         
                          MILK MAN
           AAHHHH! WE'RE IN A ZOO!
                         
          Rick searches the cheering audience for Stuey, who waves the
          Pepsi cup full of glop in the air. Rick hears Stuey's voice
          echo in his head telepathically.
                         
           STUEY (V.0.)
           Rick! Over here!
                         
          Stuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed
          BIKER sitting behind him. Elijah quiets the crowd and holds
          up a beaker of ointment.
           90.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           With this remarkable ointment of my
           own design, I will now turn this
           half-finished ghoul into the
           ultimate super freak, dedicated to
           evil!
                         
          Elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick,
          who squints under the spotlight, still searching for Stuey.
          He calls out telepathically.
                         
           RICK (V.0.)
           Stuey! Where are you?!
                         
          Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally
          blocking the biker's view. He telepathically replies.
                         
           STUEY (V.0.)
           Here I am, Rick!
                         
                          BIKER
                          (TO STUEY)
           Goddammit, kid! Would you sit
           down!?
                         
          The biker grabs the cup and dumps it over Stuey's head. The
          "good ointment" runs down all over Stuey's body.
                         
                          STUEY
           AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
                         
          All eyes turn to Stuey, who falls down and disappears onto
          the floor screaming.
                         
                          RICK
           Oh no!
                         
                          BIKER
           What the hell!?
                         
          Suddenly an EIGHT FOOT TALL MONSTER VERSION OF STUEY leaps to
          its feet and snarls down at the biker. The biker pulls a
          switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade
          crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He
          drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. He
          leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah.
                         
                          STUEY MONSTER
           YOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS!
                         
          Rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey Monster on.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Uh-oh, that kid looks pissed. EYE
           AND EYE! KILL HIM!
           91.
                         
                         
          Eye and Eye rush the stage, Uzis firing.
                         
           EYE AND EYE
           RASTAFARI!
                         
          The bullets bounce off Stuey's hide. He doinks them with his
          big monster fingers and sends them flying through...
                         
          THE TENT ROOF
                         
          across the compound, and THWOPP! Into the Giant Head's eye
          sockets, where they spin around and come to a stop, cockeyed.
          CRASH! The head's foundation crumbles and it keels over
          backwards.
                         
                         
          INT. CARNIVAL TENT
                         
          Elijah calls out to Toad.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           TOAD!
                         
          Stuey Monster roars at Toad. Toad smiles weakly.
                         
          THE TENT ROOF
                         
          Toad catapults through it, follows the path of Eye and Eye
          across the compound and CRASH! Lands head first into the
          neck of the Giant Head. He gets up with the Giant Head stuck
          on his own head, making him look like one of those big headed
          caricatures. He runs blindly across the yard and into...
                         
          THE ELECTRIC FENCE
                         
          ZZZAAAAPPP! BOINNGG! Eye and Eye zing out of the sockets,
          and Toad's tongue sticks ten feet out of the Giant Head's
          mouth. It's the biggest Tex Avery cartoon take ever!
                         
                         ELIJAH
                         
          looks worried. He scoops up some "evil ointment".
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Looks like it's time to roll out
           the big gun.
                          (TO RICK)
           Sayonara, kiddo. Any last words?
                         
          Rick considers it. He can't think of anything.
                         
                          RICK
           Nahh.
           92.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Suit yourself.
                         
          He raises the ointment over Rick. Rick has an idea for a
          last word.
                         
                          RICK
           Wait! Wait!
           (Elijah pauses. Rick
                          RECONSIDERS)
           Nahh.
                         
          Elijah glops Rick. His skin starts to smoke.
                         
                          RICK
           AHHHHRRRGGG!
                         
          Stuey Monster stalks Elijah onstage. Rick is smoking and
          shaking violently on the table.
                         
                         HERTZ
                         
          turns to his EES cronies in the audience. He looks bored.
                         
                          HERTZ
           What a waste of twelve bucks.
           Let's get the machine and go.
                         
          The other executives nod.
                         
                         RICK
                         
          starts to transform. FWOOP! His ears spring out into huge
          monster ears, kinda like in Pinocchio. FWAAP! His mouth
          grows into a massive, Big Daddy Roth style monster mouth.
          FWEEP! His upper head does the same.
                         
          His body follows suit. He bursts' out of the straps and
          grows into a drooling TEN FOOT TALL RICK MONSTER. He snarls
          at Stuey Monster.
                         
                          RICK MONSTER
           TIME TO DIE, TROLL!
                         
          The crowd and the other freaks look on, tense. Stuey Monster
          instinctively whips out a Ricky Coogan publicity photo and a
          pen.
                         
                          STUEY MONSTER
           Rick! Rick! Could you sign
           this!?
                         
          Rick Monster snarls and bashes Stuey Monster in the face.
          Stuey Monster jams the pen through the photo and snarls back.
           93.
                         
                         
                          THE CROWD
           FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
                         
          Even Julie is screaming "Fight! Fight," beside herself with
          bloodthirsty glee. Ernie smacks her.
                         
          The crowd goes nuts as the monsters trade a series of cliche
          pro-wrestling moves. Stuey bashes Rick. Rick bashes Stuey,
          etc.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Give him the skull cracker, ya big
           goon!
                         
                          ERNIE
           No way! The skull cracker is an
           illegal move!
                         
          Stuey grabs Rick's hair and marches him around the stage.
          The crowd is taking sides, screaming out advice, and foaming
          at their mouths.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Let's get this over with. Hey
           Hertz, tell your goons to
           (he turns to Hertz and is
                          STUNNED)
           What the hell-!?
                         
                         HERTZ
                         
          stands in front of the a group of EES HARDHATS who are using
          forklifts to move the Tasty Freekz Machine towards the exit.
          He notices Elijah and taps his executive ASSISTANT.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
                          (TO ELIJAH)
           Ahem. At this point in time we at
           EES regret that we must leave this
           performance prematurely.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           What are you saying!?
                         
                          HERTZ
           What we're saying is... get
           stuffed, yokel.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I figured I couldn't trust you
           corporate greaseballs!
                         
          Elijah turns to an alarm box on the wall which reads "BREAK
          GLASS IN CASE OF DOUBLECROSSING CORPORATE GREASEBALLS." He
          breaks the glass and pulls the lever inside.
           94.
                         
          A trapdoor on the stage opens and a large chemical tank rises
          out of it. Elijah jumps into the seat of the gun turret
          nozzle atop the tank. He aims the nozzle at the EES group.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Let me proudly introduce the latest
           in our product line, Noxon 25--now
           available in a convenient pump!
                         
                          HERTZ
           Bullshit! The Everything Except
           Shoes corporation releases no new
           products unless I give the order!
                         
                          ELIJAH
           I think it's time EES branched out
           a little.
                         
          He presses the plunger and the nozzle spews a torrent of
          yellow glop on the EES people. They scream in agony as their
          bodies melt together into one big mutating blob.
                         
          Alistair Cooke stands up in the audience--he's got a head
          bandage and a crutch from being trampled at the last show.
                         
                          ALISTAIR COOKE
           Ahhh! Head for the hills before he
           gets all of us!
                         
          The crowd goes berserk and rushes the exits, trampling poor
          Cooke like a roach.
                         
                         RICK MONSTER
                         
          flips Stuey onto the ground and starts stomping on him.
          Stuey is knocked out cold. Rick leaves him on the floor and
          stalks the freak cage murderously.
                         
                          RICK MONSTER
           NOW I RIP FREAKS TO PIECES!
                         
                          JIMIE
           No! We're your friends!
                         
                          RICK MONSTER
           Oh. NOW I RIP FRIENDS TO PIECES!
                         
          He rips some bars off the cage and is about to spear
          JulieErnie with a jagged steel bar when Stuey Monster grabs
          his leg and trips him. Stuey summons all his remaining
          energy to wrestle Rick, delaying him, for the moment, from
          slaughtering the freaks.
                         
          Meanwhile, Elijah is watching as
                         
          THE EES BLOB
           95.
                         
                         
          solidifies into... A GIANT SHOE made of living flesh. It's
          got eyeballs where the eyes should be, a tongue where the
          tongue should be, but it's helpless and immobile.
                         
          Elijah looks at it with pride. He does his best Ed Sullivan
                         IMPRESSION:
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Now that's a really, really big
           shoe. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmmm, I think
           I'd like a pair of those!
                         
          He swivels the nozzle turret towards the cage full of freaks
          and is about to glop them when Rick stands up above Stuey,
          blocking Elijah's trajectory at the freak cage. Rick raises
          the jagged bar above Stuey, ready to drive it down through
          his chest.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           (to Rick monster)
           Would you hurry up and waste the
           troll, please!? I got a lonely

                          KATHIE LEE
           Sorry to interrupt Rick, but you've
           been talking for almost ninety
           minutes, and we've just got to go
           to a commercial.
                         
                          RICK

          A BURLY HAND swipes all the cheese off the block and slams
          down an aluminum can labeled "MACHEESMO."

           And now back to the exciting
           conclusion of Ricky Coogan's
           incredible story.
                         
                          RICK
           Well, let's see, the other freaks
           were lined up in Elijah's sights,
           and I was about to shove a pipe
           through Stuey's skull, when all of
           a sudden, I heard a voice...
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CARNIVAL TENT - NIGHT
                         
          Rick stops the spear inches from Stuey's chest. Their eyes
          meet.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Kill him! Kill him!
                         
          Elijah's bloodthirsty goading fades away, and Cowboy's voice
          reverberates in Rick's head.
           97.
                         
                         
           COWBOY (V.O.)
           I reckon that troll could help you
           if you just let him into your
           heart... your heart... your
           heart...
                         
          The voice keeps echoing. A tear wells up in Rick Monster's
          eye. He looks over at Cowboy, who is actually calling out to
          him from the cage.
                         
                          COWBOY
           Your heart... your heart... your
           heart...
                         
          Rick Monster loses his murderous glare. He breaks into a
          warm smile, throws the pipe away and helps Stuey Monster up.
          They hug. The rest of the Freaks cheer wildly.

           Hey, ain't that somethin'?
                         
          The Worm is gushing sentimentally. He tries to hide his
          tears.
                         
                          WORM

           (Sniff) Shameless, maudlin--Baaa!
                         
          He can't hold it in anymore. He bawls like a baby.
          Meanwhile, Elijah is hopping mad.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Cut the lovey-dovey bullshit, and
           start mutilating each other!
                         
          He aims at Rick Monster and presses the fire button. The
          Glop starts to flow, but before it can make it out of the
          tip, Rick grabs hold of the nozzle, and twists it around to
          face Elijah.
                         
                          RICK
           Raarrrrrrgh!
                         
          Elijah manages to duck just in time. A stream of yellow
          Noxon 25 glop flies over his shoulder, and lands in the DUNK
          TANK full of carbolic acid that sits off to one side of the
          tent.
                         
          The acid and the Noxon mix together and bubble up menacingly.
                         
          Elijah hops down out of the gunner's chair and squares off
          against Rick Monster.
           98.
                         
          Meanwhile, Stuey Monster has released the other freaks from
          the cage. They watch the confrontation from a distance.
                         
          Elijah rolls up his sleeves. Rick growls and advances
          slowly.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           You think I made you strong? HA!
           I've cranked my DNA up so high, you
           won't know what hit you. I'm a
           wrecking machine! Aaaaaaa!
                         
          He rushes at Rick and delivers a flurry of punches to his mid
          section. They have absolutely no effect. Rick brings one
          heavy fist slamming down on Elijah's head, stopping him cold.
                         
                          ELIJAH
                          (WEAKLY)
           Ow! I think you crushed my spinal
           cord. I can't feel anything in my
           fingers.
                         
                          RICK
           Maybe you'll feel this ...
                         
          Rick rears back to kick him.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Qait--if you kill me, you'll never
           find the antidote.
                         
          The freaks all perk up. Rick's skeptical.
                         
                          RICK
           What antidote?
                         
                          ELIJAH
           A time release serum--I baked it
           into a delicious batch of
           macaroons.
                         
          A slow smile grows on the Freaks' faces, especially Rick's.
                         
                          RICK
           If you ask me, you skimped on the
           coconut!
                         
          THWAK! Rick boots Elijah between the legs, sending him
          flying through the air. He lands on the DUNK TANK SEAT over
          the bubbling Noxon/Acid. Dazed, he looks at the bullseye
          target, and back at Rick. Summoning up his last ounce of
          bravado, Elijah makes a last stand.
           99.
                         
                         
                          ELIJAH
           Come on, Coogan! Come oooon! You
           haven't got the guts to kill me!
           Go on! I dare ya'!
                         
          Rick ponders for a second. He looks over to Julie. Then...
                         
                          SCRAPPY

           Scrappy!
                         
          Scrappy the dog rushes in. He leaps up and presses the
          bullseye, dropping Elijah into the hideous mixture.
                         
                          ELIJAH
           AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!
                         
          Elijah struggles in agony. His body bubbles and mutates in
          the thick toxic soup. He sinks lower and lower into the
          gunk, until he and his cries are buried for good.
                         
          Scrappy leaps into Rick's arms and licks his face.

          Another FBI GUY investigates the dunk tank, sees Elijah's hat
          floating on top of the bubbling ooze.
                         
           ANOTHER FBI GUY
           Looks like they took care of
           Skuggs, chief.
                         
          The chief nods. They put away their guns, and approach Rick
          and the rest of the jubilant freaks.
                         
                          CHIEF
           Nice work, Ricky. You'll get a
           medal from the Vice President for
           this.

           far his sick plans would've gone.
                         
           ANOTHER FBI GUY
           Hey chief, look at this!
                         
          The FBI guy has peeled the decal off the Pepsi machine,
          revealing that it's actually a Coke machine! The chief is
          sickened to the core.
                         
                          FBI CHIEF
           Is nothing sacred?
                         
          Suddenly, the agents are distracted by a terrible scream.
          They turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see.
                         
                          FBI CHIEF
           Oh, my Lord!

          We SWISH PAN over to reveal a DRIPPING BLOB climbing out of

          him/them ELIJUS and ELLY LEE. They both have glowing red
          demon eyes and speak in Elijah's voice.

          The lights come on--no more silhouettes. Ricky looks
          perfectly normal, his old self. His weird silhouette was
          caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile
          behind him.

           for Ricky Coogan!
                         
          The audience applauds and hoots wildly.
                         
                          KATHIE LEE
           Can we bring out the other freaks
           now?
                         
          The audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from
          the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience.
          They all look clean cut and happy. They wear T-shirts with
          their former identities printed on them. "I was NOSEY," "I
          was COWBOY," "I was the BEARDED LADY" etc. Except the Worm,
          who's still a worm. His T-shirt says, "I'm Still THE WORM".
           102.
                         
                         
                          WORM
           Ridiculous... Just because a man
           doesn't like macaroons...
           Nonsense.
                         
          Suddenly a squirrel runs across stage, followed by Juan. He
          pounces and catches the furry little bugger.
                         
                          JUAN
           Gotcha! Damn, it's about time!
                         
           ALL THE EX-FREAKS
           (happy to see him)
           JUAN!
                         
                          JUAN
           Hey guys! Jeez! You look great!
                         
          They all hug.
                         
                          REGIS
           That's just great. What a story.
           And what an ending! Elijah
           transformed by the goop!
                         
                          KATHIE LEE
           And he really looked like--?
                         
                          RICK
           Exactly like you two, I swear.
           Same faces, same outfits, except
           they had these really big, hideous
           feet...
                         
          He looks down at Regis and KATHIE LEE's feet--they're big,
          hideous monster feet! Suddenly their eyes glow bright red--
          It's Elijus and Elly Lee! They speak with Elijah's voice.
                         
                          ELIJUS
           Show's over, Ricky!
                         
                          ELLY LEE
           I'm gonna drink your blood!
                         
          Elly Lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on
          Rick's throat when...
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG! Elijus and Elly Lee's eyes go funny.
          They look at each other, spit up some blood, wave to the
          audience one last time, and collapse to the floor. Julie
          stands behind them, smoking gun in hand. She rushes to Rick.
          They embrace.
                         
                          JULIE
           Rick! It's finally over!
           103.
                         
                         
                          RICK
           Yes... Yes it is.
                         
           STUEY(O.C.)
           Rick! Rick!
                         
          Rick and Julie turn and see Stuey, still a ten foot tall
          monster, running towards them. He's carrying a garbage bag
          dripping blood.
                         
                          RICK
           Stuey!
                         
                          STUEY
           Look! I found the real Regis and
           Kathie Lee!
                         
          Rick and Julie look at the bag, mortified. Stuey chuckles.
                         
                          STUEY (CONT'D)
           No, this is just my lunch!
                         
          Rick and Julie sigh with relief. Stuey pulls out a similar
          leaking bag and holds it up.
                         
                          STUEY
           (matter of fact)
           This is Regis and Kathie Lee.
                         
          Rick and Julie nod casually--"Oh."
                         
                          AUDIENCE
           Awwww!
                         
          Suddenly Elijus and Elly Lee pop up from behind the couch,
          bloodied, but still fierce. They're about to stab Rick and
          Julie when...
                         
          BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Five more shots ring out
          and they fall dead--again.
                         
          Ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Oh, like that wasn't totally
           predictable.
                         
                          JULIE
           Well, now it really is over.
                         
          Sappy END OF THE MOVIE MUSIC wells up.
                         
                          RICK
           Thank God. You know, this
           adventure has taught me something.
                          (MORE)
           104.
                          RICK(CONT'D)
           When man starts impinging on the
           subtle perfection of the earth's
           natural order, the only thing he'll
           create is havoc.
                         
                          ERNIE
           Right, Coog. I learned somethin'
           too. That men and women truly are
           equals. That the human spirit
           transcends gender and physical
           appearance, and thus it is immune
           to the petty degradations men may
           devise. I believe it was Moliere
                          WHO SAID--
                         
          Julie's had enough. She socks Ernie square on the jaw.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh, shut up.
           (She turns to Rick)
           Let's go fuck.
                         
          Rick gives her the thumbs up. They turn to the audience.
                         
           RICK/JULIE/ERNIE/STUEY MONSTER
           Good night, everybody!
                         
          The audience cheers. The HIT SINGLE from the soundtrack
          album kicks in as we...
                         
                         ROLL CREDITS
                         
          As the credits roll, and everybody continues to smile and
          wave at the cheering audience, Elijus and Elly Lee attack
          again. Ernie hands the gun to Stuey, who shoots them dead.
          Well, dead-ish. Seconds later, after some more waving, they
          attack again. This time Nosey and the Bearded Lady stab them
          to death, sort of. A little more waving, before Elijus and
          Elly Lee make another pathetic attempt. They can barely
          stand. Cowboy clubs one with a mic stand. Worm head-butts
          the other. A few seconds later, Elijus's bloodied hand
          gropes its way over the top of the studio couch. Stuey has
          to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down
          to punch him in the chops. Ernie stands off to the side,
          charging everyone five bucks per blow.
                         
          As we fade, everyone's having a go flipping, throwing,
          kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of America's favorite
          morning show hosts.
                         
           THE END?!
