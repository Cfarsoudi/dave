                          THE WILD WILD WEST

     FADE IN:

A1   EXT. ALFALFA FIELD - NIGHT                                    A1

     A slight breeze gently sways the green and purple crop.
     The CHIRP of CICADA is the only sound.

     SUPERIMPOSE:   1868 - ST. TAMMANY PARISH, LOUISIANA

     But suddenly the CHIRPING GETS LOUDER and LOUDER --
     BZZZZZ! -- until we realize it's not the cicadas, but
     a --

     SWOOOSH! A lethal, razor-sharp DISC BUZZES up over the
     horizon, swoops TOWARD the CAMERA and OUT OF FRAME!

     The CAMERA SPINS AROUND to see the disc flying away,
     chasing a man, THADDEUS MORTON, wearing a strange
     metallic collar -- exhausted, horrified, about to die.


     NEW ANGLE - MORTON

     He looks over his shoulder, panting -- he's been running
     forever.

                              MORTON
                       (mumbling)
                Madman... Hideous spider... Run...
                Run! Warn the President...

     Morton zig-zags through a grove of trees, a desperate
     attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc. But the
     ruse is futile. The disc goes straight through the
     trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies.


     NEW ANGLE - OLD WAGON

     dilapidated, broken down, weathering away in the field.
     Morton runs around the wagon -- but the DISC BUZZES
     straight through the sideboards! Wood shavings spit
     everywhere! There's no stopping this thing.


     NEW ANGLE - MORTON

     running for his life -- stops, turns. He turns,
     incomprehensibly mumbling, pleading for his life,
     cowering.

                                 MORTON
                Noooooooo!!!!!

     And the DISC SWOOSHES TOWARD the CAMERA -- BZZZZZZZ!

                                                     CUT TO:


     BLACK

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:


     NIGHT SKY FULL OF STARS - LOW ANGLE

     A man leans INTO FRAME. This is GENERAL McGRATH.      And
     he's there to collect the silver death disc.

                                McGRATH
                         (to the unseen,
                          dead Morton)
                  And they says you scientists are
                  supposed to be smart.


1    EXT. DUSTY ROAD - LOW ANGLE - NIGHT                              1

     HOOVES THUNDER by. Then bouncing, skidding wagon wheels.
     Up on the empty buckboard is a pair of murderous ex-Rebs.
     As the Rebs pass a pint of whisky, lash the six-horse
     team on, PAN WITH the wagon to see it's headed for...


2    EXT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                         2

                                SALOON GIRL (O.S.)
                  The legendary Captain James West
                  and I finally got him all to
                  myself.


3    INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                         3

     WEST is bathing with the beatiful SALOON GIRL.

                                WEST
                  That's right, sugar, and you
                  should feel free to treat him
                  just bad.

     She moves in and kisses him, long and hard. West hears
     the CLATTER of the APPROACHING WAGONS. He stops the
     kiss and peeks out the knothole.


4    EXT. WAREHOUSE - WEST'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT

     Down below, West sees the wagon with the Rebs.

    WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                            3.

5   INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                      5

                            WEST
                     (to himself)
              General McGrath's boys. I thought
              y'all was never gonna show up.

                            SALOON GIRL
              Mister West, you wouldn't be here
              workin' tonight, now would you?

                             WEST
              No, no. 'Course not. Not tonight.
              Would you be working if you were up
              here with you?

                               SALOON GIRL
              Good.

    They start kissing again. He surreptitiously peeks out
    the knothole, while continuing his kiss.


6   INT. FAT-CAN CANDY'S - NIGHT                                  6

    This two-story, Victorian building across town is a
    "gentlemen's sporting house" in name only. Drunken
    roughnecks and ex-Confederate soldiers goose and maul
    the rouged-up tarts.

    AT BAR - WOMAN

    shrinks back from the moronic ribaldry. The Toulouse
    Lautrec lighting only accentuates her garish hair and
    makeup, identifying her as a SOILED DOVE. A whore -- not
    to put too fine a point on it. She's trying not to make
    eye contact with two men seated at a table across the
    parlor.


    SOILED DOVE'S POV - GEN. McGRATH AND HUDSON

    HUDSON is a fearsome-looking Indian in a well-tailored
    suit. Long black braids descend incongruously from under
    a homburg hat. As for his companion...

    McGRATH is a mountain of drunken pus. Six foot, sweating
    like a Devonshire hog with his tattered, undersized
    Confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top.
    His ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to
    be a miniature leather Victrola horn. McGrath smiles at
    our Soiled Dove and makes a little kissing gesture.

    ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE

    Eyes widened in revulsion. What evil abides in this
    Godforsaken place? Now a drunkenly EYE-CROSSED REB
    licks Dora's ear, then whispers something in it.
    Something unspeakably vile, by Dora's expression.

                              DORA
                 I'm sorry. That won't be
                 possible. I have... tonsillitis.


7   EXT. WAREHOUSE - WEST'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT         7

    The Rebs load the boxes onto the wagon. We see the wheel
    of the wagon up against the rotted leg of the water
    tower.

                               BIG REB
                 Pack'er up good, Virgil.    Next stop
                 N'Orleans.


8   INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                     8

    West is unaware that she's watching him, not watching
    her.

                               SALOON GIRL
                        (admonishing)
                 Jim!

                               WEST
                 Ah, this hole is a safety issue.
                 I'm thinking, what if it starts to
                 rain and the water level goes up.
                 It could suck you right up. I'm
                 protecting you. (variations)

    Saloon Girl frustrated, has grabbed West's boxer shorts
    (with little horses on them) and plugs the hole with
    them.

                               SALOON GIRL
                 Problem solved.

                               WEST
                 Belle, you don't just ram a man's
                 underbritches into a knothole.
                 You wanna plug the hole, you ram
                 your own britches in there.

    West is at a loss.    She moves in for another kiss.

     WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                             4A.

9    EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         9

     The HORSES SPOOK as a crate is dropped onto the wagon.


     CLOSE - AXLE

     caught on the WATER TOWER LEG.    It CREAKS.


10   INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                       10

     West hears the CREAK.    He breaks the kiss.

                                SALOON GIRL
               Oh, Jim.

                             WEST
                      (serious)
               Much as I'd like to take credit
               for that you might need to hand
               me my gun...

     The tower starts to topple.

                             WEST
               ... Hand me my gun.

     It CRASHES...

                                                    CUT TO:


11   EXT. WAREHOUSE SKYLIGHT - NIGHT                                11

     West crashes down into the tarp covering the boxes. The
     only people more shocked than he is are the guards and
     the Rebs he just dropped in on. West picks himself up,
     smiles coolly at the drenched slack-jaws.

                             WEST
               Okay, who just made a wish?
               Was it you?

     He looks up at the freaked-out Saloon Girl, still in the
     tank. She hangs on with one hand, the other hand
     clutches his clothes.

                             WEST
               I could sure use those clothes
               now.

     She responds by Frisbee-ing his hat down. West picks it
     up, with a look... uses it to cover his genitals.

                                BIG REB
                  Well, we got us a shy nig...

     But he never gets that word out. Bang! West lashes a
     lightning martial arts kick to the Reb's jaw.

                                WEST
                  Fought five long years with the
                  Union Army not to hear that word
                  again. And you boys lost,
                  remember?

     As the other Reb comes at him, he spins, still holding
     the hat in front of him... and whap! Down that one goes.
     West looks up at the none-too-bright water tank woman.

                                WEST
                  How 'bout some pants!?

     As she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap...

                                                              5.

12   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT (SAME TIME)                            12

     General McGrath checks a pocket watch, looks up
     impatiently at the Indian, Hudson. His eyes drift
     upwards... to the balcony where...


     ANGLE ON UPSTAIRS BALCONY - TWO MORE EX-REBS

     have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk.

                             McGRATH
               I'm still waiting on my guns and
               ammo, but I see my men have
               brought your merchandise.

     McGrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for
     Hudson to confirm. Hudson nods.

                             McGRATH
               I had expected to be delivering it
               personally to Mr...

     Hudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name.
     The Indian speaks in a very precise King's English.

                              HUDSON
               My employer, here in a brothel?
                      (a small ironic
                       smile)
               That would be quite... redundant.


13   EXT. STREET - ON CARRIAGE - NIGHT                             13

     MOVE IN ON an elegant brougham driven by a very large,
     very striking woman in livery.

     As the carriage passes under the gas lamp, we can make
     out the top-hatted silhouette of McGrath's "employer,"
     DR. ARLISS LOVELESS. Clustered around him inside the cab
     are three more beautiful women. As he strokes the cheek
     of the ORIENTAL one with the back of his hand like a
     cat...


14   INT. FAT-CAN'S - McGRATH AND HUDSON - NIGHT                   14

                             HUDSON
               You'll meet him when the time --
               and place -- are appropriate.
               Now...
                      (stands)
               ... shall we go upstairs to check
               the 'merchandise'?

                                                              6.

14   CONTINUED:                                                     14

                                 McGRATH
                  Frankly, Mr. Hudson, I wasn't
                  planning to walk those oaken
                  stairs with you. Direct me to the
                  poot, sir. Something young and
                  creamy. A gamer that takes to the
                  crop and spur.

     McGrath looks to the singer (Rita), who beats a hasty
     retreat from him after her song. So, once again, McGrath
     lays his rheumy eyes on...


     ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE

     She's oblivious, more intrigued by the ex-Rebs on the
     balcony with the trunk. As she starts for the stairs...
     a man's hand grabs her. It's the Eye-Crossed Reb again.

                                EYE-CROSSED REB
                  You drive a hard bargain, lady.
                  All right, fifty cents to take
                  them big juicy lips and...

                                DORA
                  Still not interested.

     She tries to pull away.    But the Reb won't let go.

                                EYE-CROSSED REB
                  But you gotta be interested.
                  You're a whore.

     Suddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage.
     The falsetto becomes a baritone growl.

                                DORA
                         (baritone)
                  That doesn't mean a girl can't
                  have high standards.

     Just as the Reb registers the odd new voice... wham!    Her
     corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw.    The
     Reb's eyes roll back... and he slumps to the ground.

     Whooa, hoss... the Soiled Dove is a man! He's ARTEMUS
     GORDON and his true profession will be revealed to us
     shortly. But now, as he/she stashes the unconscious Reb
     behind the bar, straightens bosom and wig...


15   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         15

     West is trying to get dressed.

     As he pulls on one leg of his pants, a guard lunges at
     him with a knife. West hops up on one leg, smacks the
     guy with a mule kick.

     Now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve. When the
     hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist --
     which coldcocks the other guard.

                                WEST
                  Could I have a little privacy
                  here?

     As if in response, the water tower, still hovering above,
     now crashes to the floor -- obliterating his opponents.

                                WEST
                  Thank you.

     He calmly looks up in time to catch the falling, naked,
     screaming Saloon Girl in his arms.

                                WEST
                  You'll have to excuse me,
                  darlin'... but my evidence is
                  getting away.

     West gallantly puts her down, jumps up, grabs the
     overhead block and tackle system and slides through the
     warehouse. As the HORSE TEAM, which has spooked,
     THUNDERS past...


     CLOSEUP - WEST

     sails onto the runaway wagon. As he pulls himself into
     the back, he gives the shivering Saloon Girl a tip of his
     hat -- now on his head.

                                WEST
                  Sorry about there not being any
                  towels.


16   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT (SAME TIME)                            16

     General McGrath   leers down a line-up of Fat-Can's girls.
     Just as he gets   to the beautiful singer, who looks sick
     at the thought,   suddenly Gordon intrudes. He/she blocks
     out the singer,   poses coquettishly -- sucking a
     lollypop.

                                McGRATH
                  What's your name, missy?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                 8.

                                GORDON/DORA
                         (demurely; back to
                          his falsetto)
                  Dora. Would you like to go
                  upstairs?

                                McGRATH
                  Oh, indeedy I would.

     Gordon/Dora starts to go as the Eye-Crossed Reb wakes up.
     He grabs him/her, very pissed.

                                 EYE-CROSSED REB
                  Hey, c'mere!   Who the hell are you
                  anyway?!

                                   McGRATH
                  She's... mine!

     Blam! McGrath emphasizes his claim by gut-shooting the
     Reb. The shot makes Dora/Gordon jump and the room go
     quiet. As the Reb crumples, McGrath turns back to
     Gordon/Dora, oddly inspired.

                                McGRATH
                  I feel like... a ditty!

                                GORDON/DORA
                  A ditty? But General...
                         (trying to be
                          coquettish again)
                  ... my talents really lay
                  elsewhere.

                                McGRATH
                  Nothing stokes the fire in my
                  loins like a ditty.

     McGrath hauls him/her over to the piano player.

                                McGRATH
                  You've got some pretty fair lungs
                  on ya, girl, now use 'em!

     He punctuates with a slap to Gordon/Dora's rump.      The
     other singer (Rita) watches too.


17   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT                                           17

     Gordon/Dora is sweating. Reluctantly, he/she whispers
     something to the piano player. He clears his throat and
     begins singing.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                  'Buy a drink for the boys
                  In the backroom for me...'


18   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - WILD WAGON RIDE - NIGHT                     18

     West spots the contents of an open box.    Eyes widen.


     CLOSE - BOX - DOZEN GLASS VIALS

     stuck in sand. But clinking together ominously as the
     wagon races over the cobblestones.

                                WEST
                  Backwards-ass bumpkins got a wagon
                  full of nitro...!

     West tries to steady the glass vials with his hands...
     but it's no use. He quickly climbs over the boxes, onto
     the buckboard seat. But the reins are dragging on the
     ground beneath the frothing horses.

     West leaps onto the horses as the wagon careens down the
     street. He pulls himself over the first one's neck...
     onto the next horse. And as he tries for the lead horse,
     he falls between them!


19   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT                                          19

     Gordon/Dora singing. He/she struggles through the song
     in a very tough room.

                                GORDON/DORA
                  'And tell them I tried...
                  And tell them I cried...'

     Just when it looks like the stone-faced rowdies might rip
     him/her apart, McGrath starts tapping a mud-caked toe.
     Encouraged, Gordon/Dora belts out the next verses OVER...


20   EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - WILD WAGON RIDE - NIGHT                     20

     West's custom boots drag in the dirt as he's about to be
     trampled under the hooves of the freaked-out horses. And
     if he hasn't got enough problems, the lynch pin attaching
     the team to the wagon has almost worked its way out.


     CLOSE - BACK OF WAGON - NITRO VIALS

20   CONTINUED:                                                     20

     CLANKING together like chimes...


     CLOSE - WEST

     Straining with every ounce of strength in his body, he
     pulls himself up by the harness onto...


     CLOSE - WILD-EYED LEAD HORSE

     West grabs for the halter.

                                 WEST
                  Whoa now...!

     But it doesn't whoa. The wagon goes around a corner up
     on two wheels! It's about to tilt over when West grabs
     both the horses' ears, yanks them back -- screaming into
     them.

                                WEST
                  I said, whoa!!!

     This approach seems to work.


21   EXT. RISE ABOVE FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT                              21

     The team comes to an abrupt stop... and with it the wagon
     hanging over the edge of a steep drop.

     Jim carefully climbs off. He slaps the dust on his
     jacket, straightens the crease in his trousers. When he
     looks up, a bitter smile.

                                WEST
                  Well, well, this is workin' out to
                  be a perfect day. My man...


     HIS POV - VICTORIAN BUILDING - ACROSS STREET

     The tasteful sign under the red light reads: "FAT-CAN
     CANDY'S." And framed in the window, General McGrath with
     his singing soiled dove.

                                WEST (O.S.)
                  ... General Bloodbath McGrath.

     McGrath is clapping with the crowd of misfits who are now
     singing along with Gordon/Dora. He/she's won over the room.

                             GORDON/CROWD
                      (rousing finish)
               And tell them I tried just the
               same...!

     He/she curtsies to rousing applause. McGrath beams like
     a man with the fire in his loins roaring. He grabs his
     little songbird and up the stairs they go.

     Out the WINDOWS, we see West tracking them.    Simul-
     taneously going up outside steps.


23   INT. FAT-CAN'S - UPSTAIRS - GORDON/DORA                       23

     leads the sweating, leering General down the hall.
     He/she quickly opens and closes boudoir doors --
     ostensibly to find a free room for their assignation.
     The real agenda is to find the mysterious trunk.


     ANGLE ON DOORWAY #1

     Quick peek. He/she registers a mild reaction of shock.
     Closes that door and moves on to...


     ANGLE ON DOORWAY #2

     Quick peek. The two rebs sitting on the trunk. At their
     feet is a wriggling burlap sack. The "merchandise" is alive.

     Gordon/Dora giggles like a schoolgirl.

                             GORDON/DORA
               Well, that's a new one.

     McGrath slams the door, drags Gordon/Dora roughly...


24   INT. BOUDOIR - CONTINUOUS ACTION                              24

     Our soiled dove has her back to the door as if steeling
     herself for the task at hand. McGrath beckons her over
     to the bed.

                             McGRATH
               Don't let the ear scare you.    I
               lost it at Chickamauga.

     Gordon/Dora squints at the jerry-rigged ear.

                  Oh really. One can hardly
                  notice...
                         (fiddles with her
                           belt buckle)
                  Would you mind...? I... I...
                  can't seem to release the clasp of
                  my belt.

     Say no more. McGrath is on her like a flash, fidgeting
     with it. But it pops open, revealing a spiraling screen
     courtesy of Dr. Mesmer. His eyes lock onto it.

                                McGRATH
                  Wha... what's this?

                                GORDON/DORA
                  It's a deep, deep pool. Maybe
                  your old swimmin' hole. Getting
                  sleepy, General?

                                 McGRATH
                         (ga-ga)
                  Yes, I'm sleepy.

     McGrath sits on the floor.        Gordon smiles... this is
     gonna be easy.

                                GORDON
                         (normal voice)
                  Good. You're going to be my
                  little doggy. And when I say
                  'speak,' you tell me everything I
                  want to know. Understood?

                                    McGRATH
                          (barks)

                         (as he does)
                  Now tell me who's in the sack next
                  door. Is it the scientist, Dr.
                  Escobar? Speak!

                                    McGRATH

                  him for...

     But McGrath doesn't answer. Gordon's Mesmer spiral slows
     to a stop. McGrath is coming out of the trance. McGrath
     starts to growl, rip at his/her petticoats.

                                 GORDON
                  Watch the swirling spiral!   Lie
                  down, bad dog!

     As Gordon notices that his contraption's failed...

     McGrath reach for his boot knife. Just as the deranged
     general's about to plunge it into Gordon/Dora...

     ... the WINDOW EXPLODES. Jim West comes tumbling into
     the room, kicks the knife out of McGrath's hand in one
     smooth move. West rolls to his feet, fixes a gallant
     smile on Gordon/Dora.

                                WEST
                  Didn't mean to startle you, ma'am.
                  Looked like you could use some
                  help.

     It takes Gordon a moment to recover. He stares at this
     black Samaritan, obviously having no clue who he is.

                                GORDON
                         (clears throat to
                          recover falsetto)
                  Looks can be deceivin'... dark
                  stranger. I am perfectly fine.

     West quickly pats McGrath down, removes a revolver and
     his bag of gold coins.

                                WEST
                  I can see that, darlin'. Woman of
                  your caliber probably gets top
                  dollar, too. So here you go.
                         (flips her McGrath's
                          coin bag)
                  You can run along. I'll take care
                  of McGrath.

     As West sticks the barrel of his gun in McGrath's
     gramophone ear, Gordon's eyes pop.

                  C'mon, lady. You got the money.
                  Have a little dignity.

     Gordon jerks West's gun hand away from McGrath's head
     just as the dog-soldier comes around. McGrath suddenly
     lunges at him.

                                McGRATH
                         (bellows ferociously)
                  West...!!!

     He drives his full weight into Jim's back, pushing him out
     into...

     McGrath's rebel yell brings help from all directions.
     DOORS BANG open all along the hallway. Not just
     McGrath's men, but Hudson and his crew. A melee will
     ensue.

     West pushes the monster off of him, rolls as a BULLET
     SPLINTERS the WOOD where he just was. The SHOT STARTS...


     ANGLE - STAMPEDE OF SEMI-CLAD WHORES

     all screaming hysterically and heading for the exits.
     The beautiful young singer, who'd been coming up the
     stairs alone, is now swept back down them.

     Gordon, still in character, pushes his way upstream to the
     room where the scientist is held.


28   INT. FAT-CAN'S - ADJACENT ROOM - NIGHT                        28

     Hudson, his back turned, barking orders at his henchmen.

                                HUDSON
                  Get Escobar out of here!

     The henchmen heft the wriggling sack, when:

                                GORDON (O.S.)
                  Leave him right there.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             15.

28   CONTINUED:                                                    28

     Hudson whirls to see the gruff-talking Gordon/Dora holding
     the perfume bottle on him like it's a Colt 45. Now Gordon
     shakes one of the heavy bracelets off his wrist, CLICKS a
     LOCK, snapping it open. He's accessorized with custom
     handcuffs.

                                GORDON
                  Let's go, Hudson... hands!

     Hudson gives a sick little smile, reaches for his gun
     when... WSSSSHT!

     Gordon sprays him in the eyes with the second bulb of the
     atomizer. (The first Mace!) Hudson howls in pain, drops
     the gun, rubs his eyes madly with both hands.

                                  GORDON
                  Thank... you.

     Gordon starts to snap the cuffs on the perfectly
     presented wrists when...


29   FAT-CAN'S - UPSTAIRS HALL - WEST - NIGHT                           29

     brawling a dozen attackers. West spots McGrath trying to
     escape down the stairs. He uncorks a lethal kick, sending
     a thug flying through the doorway and into the back of
     Gordon.

     Gordon staggers, drops the perfume/mace BOTTLE which
     SHATTERS. Hudson recovers his vision enough to send a
     fist into Gordon's mascaraed face, pile-driving him back
     into the hall. While Hudson and his men make their
     escape down the back stairs with the scientist sack...


     CLOSE - WEST AND GORDON

     West is blocked from chasing McGrath, Gordon from going
     after Hudson. West tries to push her aside.

                                WEST
                  U.S. Army... Now get outta my
                  way, lady!

                                 GORDON
                         (the baritone
                          growl)
                  I'm no lady! I'm a U.S. Marshal!
                  You get out of my way!

     Gordon whip off his wig, reaches inside it for something.
     West blinks at the weirdness, reflexively draws his Colt.
     As Gordon withdraws not a gun, but a badge, from his
     wig...

                                                            16.

30   EXT. RISE ABOVE FAT CAN'S - CARRIAGE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)     30

     is waiting at the top of the hill beside the nitro wagon.
     Dr. Loveless is beside it, face still shadowed.


     INSIDE CARRIAGE - FAIR-SKINNED BEAUTY

     has opera glasses trained on the second story of Fat-
     Can's. Her name is LIPPENREIDER. And now we'll see why.

                             LIPPENREIDER
                      (in a monotone)
               Get out of my way... get out of my
               way... U.S. Army... U.S. Marshal.

                             LOVELESS
               Oh, dear...

     The lip-reading is interrupted by the arrival of...


     ANGLE - TOP OF INCLINE - HUDSON AND HIS HENCHMEN

     who come racing up with the scientist-in-the-sack.

                             HUDSON
               Federal agents inside, sir!

                              LOVELESS
               So Miss Lippenreider informs me.
                      (sighs)
               Still, I believe good manners
               dictate we should send out...

     His cane telescopes out and Loveless pokes the lynch pin
     out of the harness on the nitro wagon. Then he gives the
     wagon the slightest push.

                             LOVELESS
               ... the welcome wagon.

     Once started, the wagon rolls downhill, toward the back
     door of Fat-Can Candy's, picking up speed...

     Then, as his female coterie pulls the burlap sack into
     the carriage, Loveless steps in behind. And they're off.


31   INT. FAT CAN'S - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT                       31

     West and Gordon, oblivious to the impending disaster...

                             WEST
               So now what...?

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                17.

     The answer is provided as the NITRO WAGON hits
     downstairs.

     KABOOOOOOM!!!    THEME MUSIC UP... as we roll...

     The titles are the familiar animated freeze frames from
     the TV show. In the two corners are our heroes -- Upper
     left shows West with his gun levelled toward... upper
     right -- Gordon with his wig in one hand and his badge in
     the other, pointed across toward West.

     The cowboy/agent in the middle square fights and defeats
     the various bad guys. Then as he exits, QUICK ZOOM ON
     main title: "THE WILD WILD WEST."

33   EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY (1869)                               33

     West rides his magnificent black stallion down
     Pennsylvania Avenue.

     Besides horse-drawn carriages, West shares the dusty road
     with people on bicycles -- the latest craze. He finally
     pulls his steed up at his destination...


     EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

     West dismounts, ties his horse to a hitching post and
     winces as he puts his weight on a sore leg.


34   INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY                                           34

     West limps past black floor scrubbers. They stop working
     to marvel at this handsome black man dressed in custom
     cowboy duds walking in there like he owns the place.

     But not everybody's so impressed. As West heads toward
     the Oval Office, four self-important house detectives
     block his way.

                                HOUSE DETECTIVE
                  Whoa there, 'pardner.'
                         (as West stops)
                  Winning the war may have got you
                  forty acres and a mule, but you
                  can't just traipse into the
                  President's office. Now gimme
                  that gun.
                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               18.

34   CONTINUED:                                                      34

     He nods at the six gun on West's hip. West coolly flexes
     his hand above it, like he's about to draw...

                                 WEST
                  This gun?

     Then like lightning, with his other hand, he whips out a
     sawed-off shotgun hidden by his jacket. He pokes the
     12-gauge barrels up against Pinkerton's surprised crotch.

                                 WEST
                  Or this one?

     A voice stops the situation from escalating further.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.)
                  Gentlemen!

     The detective's head swivels around to see...


     ANGLE - OVAL OFFICE DOOR - PRESIDENT GRANT

     stands in the doorway.

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  Don't make Captain West any later
                  for his appointment than he
                  already is!

     The detectives back away from the hair-trigger cowboy as
     fast as they can. West reholsters the gun and
     continues...


35   INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE                                  35

     President Grant goes over to his desk, lights a cigar.
     Backlit in the haze, the portly bearded figure lives up
     to the myth.

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  Been a lot of death threats lately
                  ... Cabinet made me hire some damn
                  detectives.
                         (by way of apology)
                  Drink, cigar?

                                WEST
                  Thank you, sir.

     West limps across the room to the bar, pours himself a
     glass of whiskey, takes a cigar out of the humidor.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               19.

35   CONTINUED:                                                      35

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  I hear you let General McGrath
                  get away?

     Now West's blood is up.

                                WEST
                  Sir, I had him right in my hands
                  when some half-a-sissy wearin' a
                  dress ruined...

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                         (cuts him off)
                  Artemus Gordon.

                                WEST
                  You... know him?

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                  Of course I know him, he's the
                  best marshal I've got! He's a
                  genius.
                          (off West's
                           incredulous look)
                  Gordon has proven himself time and
                  again as a very cunning operator
                  with a rapacious intellect.
                  Nothing will stop him from
                  completing a mission for his
                  President... except the impulsive
                  actions of a headstrong cowboy!

     West just looks at him soberly. Draws his gun and
     places it against the President's head. Grant's eyes
     widen.

                                  WEST
                  Who are you?

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  I am the President of the United
                  States!

     West points the GUN to the ceiling and pulls the trigger.
     BLAM!!! As Grant jumps a foot and plaster rains down...

                                  WEST
                  Wrong answer.    Who are you?

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  I am the President of...
                         (as West cocks gun)
                  ... I'm Artemus Gordon.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               20.

35   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               35

     West lowers his gun, nods at Gordon's class ring.

                                WEST
                  The President went to West Point
                  ... not Harvard.

                                PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.)
                  Will somebody tell me what the
                  hell this stunt is all about!?!


36   INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - SIDE DOORWAY -                 36
     PRESIDENT GRANT - DAY

     (the real one) stands in the doorway, hands on hips,
     surrounded by his house detectives -- their guns drawn.
     West nudges the fake Grant in the fake belly with his gun
     barrel -- go ahead. Sheepishly, Gordon starts peeling
     off his primitive, but effective, facial prosthetics.

                                GORDON
                  Sir, in perilous times like these,
                  I was simply illustrating how
                  someone impersonating you could
                  actually walk right into the very
                  bowels of the White House...

     Just as Gordon makes his intestinal allusion, West takes
     a ceremonial bayonet off Grant's desk and pokes a hole in
     the inflated bladder that was his fake paunch. The AIR
     HISSES out, finishes deflating with a flatulent R-R-RIP.
     (Hey, the first whoopee cushion?)

     Gordon scowls at him.

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  You're clever, Gordon. One day
                  it'll get you killed.

     West smirks as Grant looks up at the bullet hole in the
     ceiling, then fixes West with a disapproving eye.

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  ... And you, West -- not every
                  situation calls for your patented
                  approach of shoot first, shoot
                  later, shoot again -- then when
                  they're all dead, try to ask a
                  question or two.
                         (shakes his head)
                  Working together will be good for
                  both of you.

                  You work the way your Commander In
                  Chief tells you to work.

     Grant turns and EXITS FRAME.


37   INT. WHITE HOUSE - WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY            37

     The place is a buzzing intelligence operations center --
     state-of-the-art for the 1860's. Maps of the U.S. and
     the world are on the wall. Various staff and military
     people work CLACKING TELEGRAPHS, PRINTING MACHINES that
     GRIND out reports, etc.

     Grant stops at a display of daguerreotype photos, all
     depicting distinguished bewhiskered men.

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  Ten of our country's best
                  scientists... all kidnapped in the
                  last year. By General McGrath, it
                  now seems.
                         (turns to them)
                  The fact is, gentlemen, you've
                  both been working on the same
                  case all along. Why did it take
                  you so long to realize it?

                                WEST
                  Well, sir, one of us was still
                  trying to figure out if he was a
                  man or a woman.

     The detectives snicker over that one.    Grant's had
     enough.

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  I don't have time for this
                  bickering! One week, if we're to
                  believe this...

     Grant holds out a letter to Gordon and West.      Gordon
     snatches it, reads:

                                PRESIDENT GRANT (CONT'D)
                  -- Creating a weapons system
                  beyond the pale of contemporary
                  imagination. History and justice
                  are on my side. I suggest you put
                  your affairs in order. You have
                  one week before you will surrender
                  the U.S. Government.'

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               22.

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  This letter was delivered inside
                  this.

     An aide presents a glass case.     Inside is a cake in the
     shape of the White House.

                                GORDON
                         (reaching inside)
                  Marzipan, isn't it?

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                          (grabs his hand)
                  Wait!

     Suddenly dozens of deadly-looking spiders swarm out from
     inside the cake. Gordon jerks his hand back.

                                WEST
                  It's McGrath, sir. The South is
                  rising again. I'm gonna stop it.

                                GORDON
                  Sir, West's obsession aside,
                  McGrath may be a vicious killer,
                  but a mastermind he is not. So
                  whom do we seek? After consulting
                  with Intelligence...

                                WEST
                         (cuts him off)
                  McGrath's headed for New Orleans.
                  The longer we stand here talkin',
                  the farther away he gets. I don't
                  need 'Intelligence' to tell me
                  that.

                                 GORDON
                  Ah, so that would mean you rely on
                  ... Stupidity?

     Grant's had enough.

                                PRESIDENT GRANT
                  Gentlemen! I'm leaving today for
                  Utah where the transcontinental
                  railroads will be joined at
                  Promontory Point.

     Grant points to a map of the United States. The railroad
     lines have been drawn in... still a gap between them.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

37   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               37

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                  For the first time the United
                  States will truly be united.
                         (turns, holds up
                          letter)
                  Someone wants us divided. Now
                  look, you two are the best I've
                  got. Put aside your differences
                  and stop this madman... whoever he
                  is. If you fail, well... we may
                  never know how great this country
                  could've been.
                         (snaps off a salute)
                  You have a week. Dismissed!

     They both return Grant's salute as the President stomps
     off. His AIDE now approaches.

                                AIDE
                  The President has put a private
                  train at your disposal. Engine
                  number five, track six.
                         (holds out a
                          wrapped box)
                  Mr. Gordon, the item you
                  requested.

     Gordon takes the box, hurries to catch up with West.


38   EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY                                          38

     West and Gordon, walking toward the hitching post. West
     is so beside himself he can barely untie his high-voltage
     stud. He glowers at Gordon who goes over to where...


     ANGLE - STRANGE-LOOKING BICYCLE

     Is parked on the other side of a bush. It has the
     customary big wheel in the front, little wheel in the
     back. (Hidden from sight is a motor on the front tire.
     Dual manifolds that sling under the rider's legs.)

     West shakes his head in disgust.

                                WEST
                  Figures.

                                GORDON
                  I call it the Bi-axle Nitro-
                  Combust...

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                           24.

38   CONTINUED:                                                  38

                                 WEST
                  Save it.   I've gotta train to
                  catch.

     West swings into the saddle. He looks at the SNORTING
     wild HORSE under him, then down at Gordon attaching the
     box onto the seat of his Nitro-whatever.

                                WEST
                         (snaps off a smug
                          salute)
                  Yee-haaa!!

     West spurs his horse and leaves Gordon in the proverbial
     cloud of dust.

     Although West's intentions are clear, for some reason,
     Gordon's in no particular hurry. He sighs, climbs on the
     bike, takes out a hankie and cleans a pair of goggles.
     Then, finally ready...

                                 GORDON
                  Avant!!!

     VROOOM! An ENGINE KICKS IN and Gordon rockets forward.
     (Yep, Artemus has invented the first motorcycle!) Fiery
     exhaust blasts out of the manifolds as the bike propels
     him down the street at about 60 mph right past...


     ANGLE ON WEST AND HIS STALLION

     who both look over in wide-eyed shock. The horse rears
     as Gordon SCREAMS by -- leaving them in a cloud of
     internal combustion.


39   EXT. C STREET TRAIN STATION - TRAIN ENGINE - DAY            39

     From in front, as it CHUGS TOWARDS us. Sitting up in the
     spanking new steam engine (No. 5) is a white-haired
     Coleman. The Wanderer is his pride and joy. Coleman
     pushes the throttle forward and the ENGINE ROARS PAST
     us... followed by a tender, and two gleaming passenger
     cars.

     Then comes West THUNDERING past in a desperate effort to
     catch up.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               25.

39   CONTINUED:                                                      39

     ANGLE - WITH WEST

     riding like hell. Getting the last ounce of speed out of
     his well-lathered steed, he finally pulls alongside the
     rear passenger car. He looks up... In the window, we see
     Gordon engrossed in what he's doing... which appears to
     be sewing.

                                WEST
                  Stop this train!! You hear me!?!

     If Gordon hears him, he pretends not to.    He just
     casually makes the next stitch.

     West's horse has had it. They're losing ground to the
     train. At the last second, West leans over at full
     gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train. He
     swings out of the saddle, hanging on for dear life,
     blowing in the breeze like laundry.

     Finally, his boot finds a small metal plate to put its
     weight on. Just as West stands safely on it... whoosh!
     He flies up in the air and drops through a sliding
     partition in the roof.


40   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                                40

     The car is like a classy Victorian men's club. Bar
     stocked with crystal decanters, a pool table, decorative
     pistols on the wall, books, etc. Gordon, seated in a
     club chair, looks over as West falls from the ceiling
     into a seat. He's hot, dusty and very pissed off. He
     glowers at Gordon murderously.

                                GORDON
                         (calmly)
                  Thanks for dropping in.

                                 WEST
                  Forget the bikes, the beards, the
                  fake boobies. Put down the
                  needlepoint and let's settle
                  this like men!

     He takes off jacket, starts rolling up his sleeves.
     Gordon remains remarkably cool, continues sewing.

                                GORDON
                  As a matter of clarification, this
                  isn't needlepoint. This is.

     He shows him some real needlepoint.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               26.

40   CONTINUED:                                                      40

                                GORDON
                  Right now, I'm putting the final
                  touches on a new invention of my
                  creation. I call it... The
                  Impermeable. It's a vest that,
                  when worn under the clothing, can
                  stop any modern bullet fired even
                  at close range.

     West draws his gun, aims it at Gordon's stomach and cocks
     the trigger.

                                 WEST
                  Really?

     Gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach.

                                GORDON
                  But it hasn't been really
                  tested empirically yet.

                                 WEST
                  Get up!

     West takes off his guns and puts them on the table.

                                GORDON
                         (yawn, yawn)
                  Guns. I find them so primitive
                  and unnecessary... if one has done
                  one's proper planning.

                                 WEST
                  Yeah?   How do you feel about a
                  fist?

     Gordon puts down The Impermeable, stands with a weary
     sigh.

                                GORDON
                  I must tell you, Mr. West, I've
                  always felt that allowing a
                  situation to degenerate into
                  physical violence is a failure on
                  my part.

                                WEST
                  Well then, 'Mr.' Gordon, you
                  failed.

     Whap! West unleashes a lightning punch that drives
     Gordon across the train car. He dabs at his bloody lip.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                              27.

40   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              40

                                GORDON
                  I'm sorry, Mr. West, you brought
                  this on yourself.

     Then to West's utter amazement, Gordon puts his hands
     together as if praying while at the same time, crooking
     his right leg stork-like. Is this some kind of martial
     art? Then, he bends at the waist, and like a ballet
     dancer, extends his leg out to the wall and flips a
     switch.

     It immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down
     from the ceiling. It whacks West on the side of the
     head, and sends him spinning back onto the pool table.


     ANGLE ON POOL TABLE - WEST

     shakes it off and is about to attack again. Gordon
     calmly pokes a hidden button. Suddenly the pool table
     revolves. West is gone.

                                GORDON
                  I love this train!


41   EXT. UNDERNEATH WANDERER - DAY                                 41

     West, eyes wide, is clinging on for dear life, staring at
     the ties racing by, inches from his face.


42   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - GORDON                            42

     Gordon pours a fine Bordeaux, speaks loudly toward floor.

                                GORDON
                  The President asked for my
                  suggestions on how to make the
                  Wanderer both comfortable and
                  functional...

     As he swishes the wine in his mouth...


43   EXT. UNDER WANDERER - DAY (SAME TIME)                          43

     West reaches up to get a handhold in the myriad of tubes
     and wires on the underside of the car. As he rips one
     tube out of the undercarriage...

                                                              28.

44   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                               44

     Gordon has just settled into the club chair, puts his wine
     down on the table.

                             GORDON
               And while you're down there,
               you may want to avail yourself
               of my Sub-carriage Inter-rail
               Egressor...

     Suddenly SHACKLES SNAP out of the arms of the chair,
     pinning Gordon's wrists. Before he knows what hit him,
     the floor opens and the club chair disappears.


45   EXT. UNDER WANDERER - DAY                                      45

     Gordon appears upside down in the chair, chagrined at
     his predicament. West looks from the escape trolley
     Gordon was talking about back to his partner.

                             WEST
               Only one doin' any 'egressin'
               is gonna be you.

                             GORDON
                      (wide-eyed)
               Perhaps the President was right
               about us putting aside our petty
               differences.
                      (recites above the
                       CLATTER)
               'The opposite is beneficial, from
               things that differ comes the
               fairest attunement.' Aristotle.

     Suddenly they flip OUT OF FRAME and back into the car,
     shocked to find themselves facing...


46   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                               46

     Coleman's a scowling, grizzled old man in a coal-stained
     suit. He's got a fire in his eye, brown spittle in the
     corner of his mouth where a cigarette butt lives
     permanently, and a large copper pot in his hand.

                             COLEMAN
               Knock each other about all ya
               please, but harm my train and
               I'll douse ya like dogs.

     He threatens them with the pot of steaming liquid.   Now,
     for the first time, Gordon really looks troubled.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              29.

                  Shall we let Professor Morton
                  decide?

                                 WEST
                  Who?


47   INT. WANDERER LAB CAR - DUSK                                   47

     A severed human head is in a vise.

                                GORDON
                  Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton,
                  expert in the field of metallurgy
                  ... discovered in a field of
                  alfalfa. Kidnapped from M.I.T.
                  six months ago.

     West looks from the head to the open box.

                                WEST
                  That's a man's head!

     Gordon holds up a strange, circular metallic object.

                                 GORDON
                  ... And this magnetic collar was
                  around it when his body was
                  discovered. Haven't figured that
                  one out yet...

     But West is still staring in disbelief at the head.

                                WEST
                  That's a man's head.

     Gordon starts fiddling with a lantern positioned behind
     the head.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               30.

                                GORDON
                  According to the Retinal Terminus
                  Theory... a dying person's last
                  conscious image is burned into the
                  back of the eyeball like a
                  photograph.   Perhaps there's a
                  clue there...

     Excited, Gordon turns on the lantern attached to the back
     of his head. Beams of light are coming through his
     eyeballs, creating a blurry color image on the wall.

                                GORDON
                  Morton's last image!

                                WEST
                  That's a man's head!

     West turns his head sideways to try to view the inverted
     image projected on the wall. Gordon realizes the
     problem.

                                GORDON
                  Ah. The refraction of the lenses
                  causes the image to appear upside
                  down. We simply...

     He turns Morton's head in the vise.      It's right side up,
     but still blurry.


     ANGLE ON WALL - FUZZY IMAGE

     appears. It's a man who has a tiny Victrola horn for an
     ear. He's holding a bloody metal boomerang.

                                  WEST
                  It's McGrath.    I was right all
                  along.

     Gordon sees something in McGrath's pocket.

                                GORDON
                  He seems to have something in his
                  pocket... too fuzzy to read,
                  though...

     Gordon drums his fingers on his great frontal lobe,
     stymied.

                                GORDON
                  Mortification of the aqueous humor
                  seems to have led to the loss
                  of...

     West takes the bifocals out of the box, casually puts them
     on Morton's nose. West now gestures to the wall.


     CLOSE - IMAGE ON WALL

     The white blur in the man's pocket is now focused. We
     can see that it's the top of a piece of paper. He reads
     the writing on it.

                                WEST

48   EXT. NEW ORLEANS TRAIN SIDING - NIGHT                        48

     We see the Wanderer parked on the siding as we hear voices
     over.

                                GORDON (V.O.)
                  How about this? You could come
                  as my man servant?


49   INT. WANDERER - LAB CAR - NIGHT                              49

     Gordon has his wardrobe open. Selected from his vast
     array of costumes and disguises is a full livery outfit.

                                GORDON
                  How about this? You could come
                  as my man servant.

                                WEST

                  Oh yes, Massa Gordon, dats what
                  I'll do. And I'll jus' smile

     West is right in Gordon's face.

                         (then, cheery)
                  You could be the head.

                                WEST
                  The only thing I need to wear is
                  this.

     West straps on his holster.

                                GORDON
                  Okay, if you insist on carrying a
                  firearm, I have something I think
                  you'll find intriguing...

     Gordon displays a belt with a silver buckle. He taps the
     buckle... a Derringer pops out. West stares, impressed.

                                GORDON
                  And it would go nicely with this...

     Gordon takes out a sequined dress, holds the Derringer up
     against it.

                                WEST
                  Jim West does not wear a dress.

                                GORDON
                  Then what's your plan?

                                WEST
                  How 'bout this: I'll go as a
                  government agent who's gonna
                  kill McGrath.

                  An armed, Negro cowboy costume,

                  white Southerners, you oughtta
                  fit right in. You might even win
                  first prize!

     West starts to walk away.    Gordon grabs him.

                                 GORDON
                  Listen to me. The art of disguise
                  is what's going to get us into
                  that party, thus allowing us to

                  Now you and I are the chosen ones,
                  Jim. We're under direct orders
                  from the President himself. And
                  our mission is clear: Save our
                  country. Our freedom is at stake
                  and this is our duty as men. Now,
                  you go as a riverboat captain and

                                WEST
                  Let me tell you a little something
                  about beloved 'art of disguise'...
                  That night at Fat-Can's, I knew you
                  weren't a woman.

                                GORDON
                  But I was propositioned by three
                  men.

                                WEST
                  Gordon, you looked nasty. Your
                  breasts were all hard and stiff,
                  and were sticking straight out
                  like two rusty cannons on a
                  sunken ship.

     Gordon grabs his fake breasts off the rack.       He puts
     them on.

                                GORDON
                  These are a work of art.
                  Scientifically and aesthetically
                  perfect.

                                WEST
                  They look like shit.

                                GORDON
                  Touch them.

                                WEST
                  I don't wanna touch 'em.   I can
                  see I don't like 'em.

                                GORDON
                  What, are you afraid you're
                  wrong? Touch my breasts.

     West touches Gordon's fake breasts.

     walking through the next car, carrying a tray of tea.
     Gordon's last line got his attention. What the...?
     Coleman peeks around the corner to see West eyeing
     Gordon's "chest."

     West is thwapping Gordon's breasts.

                                WEST
                  There, Gordon, you happy?
                  I'm touching your breasts.

                                  GORDON
                  Not so rough.    The buckwheat'll
                  come out.

                                 WEST
                  Buckwheat?   That's your problem.

     West takes one of the cow udders out of Gordon's bodice
     and dumps the buckwheat onto the ground.

                                GORDON
                  What are you doing?

     West goes over to a wash basin, picks up a water pitcher
     and fills the cow bladder. West squeezes the cow bladder
     shut and holds it up to his chest.

                                WEST
                  Now, squeeze this. This is what a
                  breast should feel like.

     Passing back through the next car. When he hears that
     last line, he can't believe it. He peeks in again to

     Coleman's mouth drops.     He's sweating.

                                WEST
                  Now touch yourself.

                                 GORDON
                  You win.   I'm hard.

     Coleman walks off, shaking his head.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Suddenly, Gordon shoots the cuffs off his jacket. Out of
     one sleeve comes a pen. Out the other, a small pad of
     paper. They are both connected to a spring-loaded metal
     gizmo up his sleeve. West reacts, drawing his pistol up
     into Gordon's face.

                                GORDON
                  I was just going to jot down a
                  thought.

                                WEST
                  You know something, that's a good
                  place to put a gun.

                                GORDON
                  But then, where would I keep my
                  notepad.

                                WEST
                  You know, Artemus, I think you
                  underestimate the convenience of a
                  pocket.

51   EXT. LOVELESS MANSION - CARRIAGE - NIGHT                       51

     Jim West drops to the ground from where he'd hitched a
     ride underneath. He rolls into the shadows of the house.
     When he stands, he's face to face with a huge GUARD with
     a gun.

                             GUARD
               You got about as much chance of
               havin' an invitation as him.

     He smirks at a lawn jockey.    West reaches into his coat.

                             WEST
               Matter of fact, got it right here.

     He withdraws his hand. While the Guard squints at his
     empty palm, West grabs his head with his other hand and
     smacks it into the lawn jockey's fist... clang! West
     leans the cold-cocked Guard against the house, uses his
     shoulder as a step, boosting him up to...

                                                             34.

52   EXT. LOVELESS MANSION - BALCONY - NIGHT                       52

     West grabs the ironwork underneath and acrobatically
     swings himself over the rail. As he BREAKS the PANE on
     the French door with his gun butt...


53   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - UPSTAIRS ROOM - NIGHT                 53

     West lets himself in. Then just as he's about to part
     the heavy drapes... he hears women's voices approaching.

                             WOMAN (O.S.)
                      (in a Spanish
                       accent)
               Hey... get your hands off me!

     Now Miss Lippenreider, Amazonia and Munitia (bewigged and
     wearing costumes) wrangle a beautiful and defiant Latina
     into the room. When she turns we recognize she's the
     singer from Fat-Can's. Rita is in her early 20s, wearing
     a 19th-Century camisole so scanty, it makes it hard to
     concentrate on what she's saying.

                             RITA
               Put me in the dungeon with all
               those smelly, dirty bearded men
               ... but I am not goin' in there.

                             AMAZONIA
               You applied for the position.

                             RITA
               Yeah, a standing up position.   I'm
               an entertainer, not a...

     Amazonia grabs her by the throat, choking the word off.

                             MISS LIPPENREIDER
               Do not be selfish and stupid. He
               always spoils his new girl.

                             RITA
               Yeah. Well gimme a simple diamond
               bracelet instead of that...


     POV - THROUGH DOOR - INTO BEDROOM

     A ramp leads to a large bed. A leather and steel
     prosthesis is hanging from pulleys attached to the
     ceiling.

                             MUNITIA
               It is not so bad... once the metal
               warms up.

     Amazonia just picks her up and drags the hapless Rita
     into the room. West emerges from behind the curtains,
     shakes his head. Weird. He eases out the door and
     into...


54   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT                54

     West hears the PARTY DIN coming from down below.     He
     goes to the balcony.


     WEST'S POV - OVER STAIR LANDING - DOWNSTAIRS

     The scene below is hallucinogenically surreal. A Babel
     of foreign languages is the first thing that strikes us.
     Avant garde MUSIC is coming from two 10x10 quartet boxes
     on either side of the room to create stereo.

                                SULTRY WOMAN (O.S.)
                  An authentic cowboy outfit...
                  complete with six-guns!

     West turns to see who busted him. Coming his way is a
     ravishing Chinese girl dressed up as a DRAGON LADY.

                                DRAGON LADY
                  What a terribly clever costume,
                  Mr...?

                                 WEST
                  ... West.   Jim West.

                                DRAGON LADY
                  Well... West meets East. Mae Lee
                  East.
                         (holds out
                          delicate hand)
                  Are you here alone, Mr. West?

                                WEST
                  Actually I'm, uh trying to
                  surprise an old friend -- General
                  McGrath. Seen him around
                  anywhere?

                                MISS EAST (DRAGON LADY)
                  I don't believe that name was on
                  our guest list. And I would know.
                  I'm Dr. Loveless's personal
                  assistant.

     The name means something to West.

                                WEST
                  Dr. Arliss Loveless...? One of
                  the great founders of the
                  Confederacy with Jefferson Davis.
                  Funny how most people think he's
                  dead.

                                MISS EAST
                  Tonight's his coming-out party.

     We FOLLOW them as she takes his arm and leads him down
     the stairs, into the party.


55   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - DOWNSTAIRS - PARTY - NIGHT             55

     West surveys the crowd.

                                MISS EAST
                  See anybody that looks familiar?

     West scans the room.    Stops.

                                WEST
                  Matter of fact, I do.


     WEST'S POV - WOMAN WITH BIG HAIR

     She's got the mole, too.    Gordon has apparently encored
     his Soiled Dove get-up.

     Miss East sees who he's looking at. She makes a pouty
     face as there's a flourish from the STEREO QUARTET.

                                MISS EAST
                  I'm... jealous.
                         (blows a little
                          kiss at him)
                  Meet me later... in the foyer.

     West watches as she joins...


56   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - DOWNSTAIRS - PARTY - REST OF           56
     LOVELESS' WOMEN - NIGHT

     Miss East leads them in a sober rendition of "The Battle
     Hymn of the Republic" in front of a large doorway.

                                DISTAFF CORPS
                         (singing)

     From behind the doors we hear the WHIR of an ELEVATOR.
     It stops with a CLUNK. Suddenly...


     NEW ANGLE - DOORWAY

     bursts open and Abraham Lincoln in a mini-float appears.
     It's decked out like Lincoln's box at Ford's theater. On
     its own power, it moves past the laughing party-goers in
     the foyer. Now the women throw grapes on the floor.

                                DISTAFF CORPS
                         (singing)
                  'He has trampled down the vintage
                   Where the grapes of wrath are
                   stored!'


     WEST'S POV - ANGLE ON WHEELS OF WHEELCHAIR

     are what's trampling down the vintage. West takes in the
     whole man. Very curious. Then suddenly... KABOOM!


     ANGLE ON ABE'S HEAD

     It explodes like a pinata. Up from the hole in his neck
     peeps... DR. ARLISS LOVELESS.

                                LOVELESS
                         (impishly)
                  Don't you just hate that song?

     The Southern crowd gasps at Loveless's dramatic appearance.

                                LOVELESS
                  Why, y'all look like you've seen a
                  ghost! It's me, dear friends,
                  alive and kicking! Well, alive,
                  anyway...

     As he giggles, the distaff corps surround him and remove
     the Lincoln paraphernalia. Then step aside, revealing...


     NEW ANGLE - DR. LOVELESS

     is half a man. Literally. Cut off at the waist and
     mounted on a wheelchair platform that is powered by an
     engine, he is a man bereft of tuchus, kishkes and
     everything else in that vicinity that makes life
     interesting.

                         (chuckles)
                  We may've lost the war, but heaven
                  knows... we haven't lost our sense
                  of humor!

     Dr. Loveless looks down at himself, smoothes half of his
     Fritz Lang Metropolis-style suit. His face turns dark as
     he surveys the crowd.

                                LOVELESS
                  Not even when we've lost a lung...
                  a spleen... a bladder... two
                  legs... thirty-five feet of small
                  intestine and our ability to
                  reproduce...
                         (like a preacher)
                  All in the name of the South...
                         (then quietly)
                  ... do we lose our sense of humor.

     You can hear a pin drop.    Loveless turns to the foreign
     dignitaries.

                                LOVELESS
                  I owe a deep debt of gratitude to
                  my friends across the sea for
                  their comfort and... succor.

     He suddenly seems distracted by the comely beauties that
     surround him. Then abruptly, manically...

                                LOVELESS
                  So...! Mi casa es su casa! Ma
                  maison est a vous! Let the party
                  begin!!!

     Loveless signals to the quartets to resume playing. Miss
     East leans down and whispers in his ear. Loveless looks
     in West's direction.

     Now Loveless wheels over to West. West isn't hiding.
     He's cocky in the face of rolling danger.

                                LOVELESS
                  Mr. West, how nice of you to join
                  us tonight... and add color to
                  these monochromatic proceedings.

     West keeps a lid on his temper.    Two can play at this
     game.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                WEST
                  Well, when a man comes back from
                  the dead, it's an occasion to
                  stand and be counted.

     Loveless smiles slightly.

                                LOVELESS
                  Miss East informs me that you were
                  expecting to meet General McGrath
                  here. I knew him years ago... but
                  haven't seen him in a coon's age.

                                WEST
                  I bet a man like yourself would
                  find it difficult to keep in touch
                  with even half the people you
                  know.

     Danger flickers in Loveless's eyes.    He looks to Miss
     East.

                                LOVELESS
                  Perhaps the lovely Miss East will
                  keep you from being a slave to
                  your disappointment.

                                WEST
                  Well, you know beautiful women...
                  they encourage you one second, cut
                  the legs out from under you the
                  next.

     Loveless's face drops. He is no longer amused. Miss
     East winks at West, then accompanies Loveless in the
     direction of the study where...


57   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT                   57

     General McGrath waits impatiently. He takes two
     champagnes off a passing tray, guzzles them, then
     wipes his mouth on Dolly Madison's bustle. As his
     eyes sweep the room...


     ANGLE - WEST

     He ducks behind a mountain man carrying the French
     tricolor. When Loveless and General McGrath disappear
     into the study and close the door, West eases after
     them. He pauses as he passes the "Soiled Dove," leans
     into her big bouffant. He regards a stained-glass window
     patterned with a spider over her shoulder.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                  Hey, honey... I see a big ole
                  spider up on the wall. Hope it
                  doesn't drop down your pretty
                  dress.

     As the Soiled Dove jumps a little, West continues over to
     the study door. Now the Soiled Dove turns, and we see
     the scared/confused expression. Maybe it's because she
     is not Artemus.


     ANGLE - GORDON - ACROSS ROOM

     He's the mountain man in the fringe jacket. And right
     now he's shaking his head as he watches West resort to a
     decidedly low-tech surveillance method of Loveless's
     study.

                                GORDON
                  Peeking through the keyhole...?
                  So 18th Century.


58   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - STUDY - WEST'S POV THROUGH             58
     KEYHOLE - NIGHT

     McGrath paces in front of Loveless's desk.

                                McGRATH
                  Dr. Loveless, my men are ready to
                  go to war with no weapons to
                  fight. Ever since the nitro and
                  the guns were destroyed at Fat-
                  Can's, lice and demoralization
                  have set in!

                                LOVELESS
                  Your men will have their weapons
                  tonight. And my promise that they
                  will be part of the greatest
                  military victory of this century!

     McGrath's face relaxes into a pyorrheic grin.

                                McGRATH
                  Oh, you're a pip, sir! I'd follow
                  you into the maw of Cerberus
                  himself!

     Loveless takes pencil in hand and draws a map on the
     desk.

                  Have your men here at... 10
                  o'clock tonight.

     Loveless wheels his chair toward the door with McGrath
     behind him folding up the map...


59   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - OUTSIDE STUDY - WEST - NIGHT           59

     ducks out of the way as Loveless and McGrath emerge from
     the study. As they disappear into the throng of well-
     wishers, West takes a thin lock-pick out of his hat band.
     It takes him a moment or two, but the LOCK finally
     CLICKS. Then West slips inside, apparently undetected --
     except by an unimpressed Gordon.

     moves quickly to the desk past walls filled with oil
     portraits of various Loveless relatives. The one behind
     the desk is in the style of Gainsborough. A Loveless
     uncle is standing on a windswept grouse moor, two English
     setters by his side, a Holland and Holland double held in
     the crook of his arm.

     West turns his attention to the desk blotter. There's a
     faint imprint where Loveless drew the map. West takes
     his penknife and a pencil -- grates some graphite into
     the depressions. He's just about to do a rubbing on a
     piece of paper when... someone swipes it out of his hand.


     ANGLE ON MISS EAST

     Hands on hips, she gives him a "naughty, naughty" look.

                                MISS EAST
                  I said to meet me in the foyer.

                                WEST
                  Oh, the foy-aay. Sorry, I've
                  never been much good at French.

     But instead of scolding him further, Miss East plants an
     over-heated kiss on him. Tongues are involved. As they
     break, she gives a little nod of approval.

                                MISS EAST
                  Au contraire...

                                                    (CONTINUED)

60   CONTINUED:                                                     60

     She pushes him down into Dr. Loveless's chair.

                                MISS EAST
                  So let's see, Mr. West... are you
                  a dangerous spy of some sort? Or
                  just a handsome cowboy who likes
                  to... poke around.

                                WEST
                  Um... that second one.

     She starts to undo the buttons of his trousers. But
     West has a job to do. Well, maybe he can do two jobs at
     once...


61   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - PARTY - GORDON - SAME TIME -           61
     NIGHT

     is being the perfect party guest, moving through the
     crowd chit-chatting with this person and that (in
     French, Spanish, German) when he sees something of
     interest.

     Munitia and Lippenreider come out of an upstairs bedroom,
     lock it behind them. Hmmm. What's in there? As he
     starts upstairs, Amazonia appears, blocking his way.

                                GORDON
                  Howdy there... big sturdy gal.
                  Yer dance card full?

     Amazonia stares at him, then spiels off a couple lines
     in a foreign language that makes Gordon's eyes widen.
     He understands what she said and it's not flattering.
     Gordon moves off in a shock.


62   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - STUDY - WEST AND EAST - NIGHT          62

     are locked in a passionate embrace. West manages to
     position her nearly-naked rear end over the graphite
     powder. Very carefully, he stands, pushing her buttocks
     onto the desk and then rolling her off. The imprint on
     her left cheek is perfect. But unfortunately, it's
     backwards!


     CLOSE - WEST

     Damn. He lets Miss East concentrate on what she's doing,
     which from the SOUNDS O.S., doesn't appear to be a
     demonstration of the correct way to butter corn.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

62   CONTINUED:                                                     62

     West spies a mirror on the other side of the room and
     raises her ass up into position so he can see the
     corrected reflection.


     ANGLE ON MIRROR - MAP

     COMES INTO VIEW. It clearly shows the meeting place to
     be Malheureux Point, northeast of New Orleans. But the
     mirror reflects something else of interest...


63   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - STUDY - PAINTING - NIGHT               63

     The painting behind him has come to life. The Loveless
     in the painting swings a real shotgun around and is
     pointing it at the back of West's head.


     CLOSE - WEST

     suddenly contorts his upper torso just as an EXPLOSION
     rips the back of the chair where his head would have
     been.

     He draws and SHOOTS the would-be assassin, who falls out
     of the painting, dead. West turns to see...


     ANGLE ON MISS EAST

     A surprised look on her face. A hole in her forehead.
     He lowers her head gently to the ground, regards her
     map-imprinted rear end.

                                WEST
                  Thanks for helpin' me get to the
                  bottom of this case.


64   EXT. LOVELESS MANSION - OUTSIDE STUDY - WEST - NIGHT           64

     emerges just as a Kentucky reel starts up. He weaves his
     way through the dance floor and spots the Soiled Dove
     look-alike out on the floor. West reluctantly
     straightens his shoulders and cuts in. This bold move
     gets some looks of disapproval from the pecan pie crowd.


     ANGLE ON WEST AND SOILED DOVE RINGER

     dancing. Both look straight ahead, not at each other.
     West so as not to attract any more attention. His partner
     because she's scared shitless of this strange Negro who
     keeps hounding her.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

64   CONTINUED:                                                      64

                                 WEST
                  Real impressed the way you got the
                  dance floor staked out. Maybe one
                  of your missin' scientists'll cut
                  in.
                         (dip)
                  Thought you should know that while
                  you were trying to decide what
                  shoes to wear tonight...
                         (twirl)
                  I found that our host, Dr.
                  Loveless...

     West looks over to where Loveless is leading a contingent
     of foreigners out a side exit.

                                WEST
                  ... is meeting McGrath and his
                  troops at Malheureux Point in an
                  hour.
                         (bends her back)
                  So you enjoy the party. I'm gonna
                  go save the Republic.

     The Soiled Dove look-alike is speechless.    Before he
     goes, West leans in, smirks.

                                WEST
                  But I will say, good work on your
                  bladders tonight... they're damn
                  perky.

     And just to dig the grave deeper, West lays hands on them
     and gives them a little squeeze. This immediately
     elicits a scream and a slap in the face that shocks the
     bejesus out of the black cowboy. And he's not the only
     one.


     ANGLE ON CROWD

     staring at him. We know what they're thinking, but the
     Mountain Man behind West says it for everyone.

                                GORDON/MOUNTAIN MAN
                  Hang him!

     And with that, Gordon opens his deerskin jacket to reveal
     his own rope, which he throws to the mob. West looks
     back at the character in amazement. That's Gordon?!
     Before West can say or do anything, guns are at his
     temple, and he's swept out of the room.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     Gordon calmly straightens his coonskin cap, seemingly
     uninterested in West's imminent hanging. In the hubbub
     of everyone rushing out for the hanging, Gordon heads up
     the unguarded stairs to the locked room.

     As he pulls out his high tech auto-wind lock-pick and
     quickly gains entrance to the door...


65   EXT. LOVELESS MANSION - COURTYARD - NIGHT                       65

     Hand-held torches illuminate. The rope is tossed over a
     lamp post. PAN DOWN TO where one of the mob, dressed as
     GEORGE WASHINGTON, is binding West's hands behind his
     back.

                                GEORGE WASHINGTON
                  Looks like we're gonna have to
                  teach y'all a little lesson on how
                  to behave in polite society.

                                WEST
                  Don't grab a white lady's boobies
                  at the big redneck dance. Is that
                  the lesson? Well, I learned it.
                  Don't scratch your head with the
                  shrimp fork. I got that one too.
                  So whaddaya say we call this off?


66   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - GORDON -             66
     NIGHT

     eases in, stops at what he sees. And it sure ain't
     scientists. Beside the bed, locked in an iron disco-like
     cage, is Rita, still wearing her scanty outfit. Gordon
     squints at her, gives a charming smile.

                                GORDON
                  I feel as if we know each other
                  from someplace...?

                                RITA
                  Try again, buster...!

     She takes a breath as if she's going to start screaming.
     Gordon quickly holds up a hand.

                                GORDON
                  Ma'am, please! While I realize I
                  look like something straight out
                  of James Fenimore Cooper... I mean
                  you no harm. My name is Artemus
                  Gordon. And you look like you're
                  in trouble.

                                      RITA
                            (dryly)
                  Really?

     To Rita's amazement, Gordon opens his jacket and
     unbuttons his vest to reveal... a complete miniature tool
     shop. Quickly he pulls out a thin cable and attaches it
     to a tiny wheel on the spur of one of his boots.

                                 RITA
                  I'm Rita. I was hired here as an
                  entertainer. Not that I'm
                  complaining, but what are you
                  doin' in here?

                                GORDON
                         (looking up miles
                          of leg)
                  Looking for some missing
                  scientists... not that I'm
                  complaining.

     Gordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe. It becomes a pedal
     that operates the wheels' rotation. Now he removes a bit
     and handle from his vest and attaches the cable. Starts
     to pump his foot. It's a foot-powered drill.

                                GORDON
                  I'm a special U.S. Marshal on
                  assignment from the President.

                                RITA
                         (almost impressed)
                  If you're so special, how come
                  you're lookin' up here when
                  Loveless has 'em all workin' down
                  in the dungeon?
                         (rattles bars
                          impatiently)
                  Get me out of here and I'll take
                  you down there.

                                GORDON
                  Too late. The 'dungeon' is
                  cleaned out. It was the first
                  place I checked, right after I
                  sampled the gumbo. Bit heavy on
                  the okra.

     But Rita isn't listening to the food review. Her mind's
     racing. Finally, the LOCK CLICKS and the cage door
     swings open. Gordon takes the distressed damsel in his
     arms, lifts her out.

                                 RITA
                         (suddenly a coquettish
                          smile)
                  Thank you... Artemus, was it?

                                GORDON
                  One doesn't forget a smile like
                  that. Now where in the world was
                  it...? Have you ever played the
                  Empire Room... the Bijou Cafe
                  perhaps...?


67   EXT. LOVELESS MANSION - COURTYARD - NIGHT (SAME TIME)         67

     West is lifted onto the back of a wagon. With the noose
     dangling in front of his nose, West addresses the crowd.

                                WEST
                  Can I have everyone's attention
                  please. I think we've had a
                  series of major misunderstandings
                  and I'd like to take a moment to
                  clear them up. First, the whole
                  drumming on the boobies thing.
                  In my native land, Africa, my
                  ancestors used drums to
                  communicate between villages. I'm
                  sure y'all can see that this young
                  girl here can communicate all the
                  way down to Baton Rouge. Hell, on
                  a clear day, we might even get
                  Galveston. All I was saying was,
                  'How're you doing,' 'My name's Jim,'
                  'How's your mama?'

                  Second misunderstanding. That
                  redneck comment. I'm getting the
                  sense that some of you took that
                  negatively. You know, some of my
                  best friends are whiskey-guzzling,
                  pot-bellied rednecks just like
                  y'all here.
                         (then)
                  That slavery thing, I don't see
                  what the big deal was. Hell, who
                  wouldn't want somebody to run
                  around for them doing chores. Are
                  you going to get your big, fat,
                  lazy ass out of bed every morning
                  and pick your own damn cotton.
                  I don't think so.
                         (then)
                  Let's head on inside and knock back
                  some shine. Come on, back inside.
                  No. Okay.
                         (to Soiled Dove)
                  I stand before you as a man who
                  realizes he has done something
                  wrong and I am prepared to do the
                  right thing. Will you marry me?

     Soiled Dove gasps.

                                WEST
                  I'll take that as a no. Darling,
                  would it help at all if I said I
                  thought you were a man?

     The CAMERA FINDS the Soiled Dove.    She faints.


     BACK TO SCENE

                                WEST
                  Guess not.

     As West searches desperately for signs of rescue by his
     "partner," suddenly the wagon lurches forward...

     NEW ANGLE - WEST'S FEET

     As they plummet toward the ground.


     CLOSE - WEST'S NECK

     The rope catches... and stretches!


     CLOSE - WEST'S FEET

     As they slowly touch the ground.

     Nobody is more confused than West.


     ANGLE ON CROWD

     How the fuck did that happen? But before anybody can
     figure out Gordon's trick rope, speak of the devil...

                               GORDON (O.S.)
                  Hey-yaa!!!

     The crowd turns with alarm to see...


     ANGLE ON TEAM OF CHARGING HORSES

     Nostrils flared and wild-eyed, are having their rumps
     snapped by Gordon's reins. Rita holds on for dear life
     as the mad Mountain Man drives the carriage at full speed
     right into the crowd -- scattering them.


     ANGLE ON WEST

     He sees his opportunity for rescue, puts a foot into the
     back of George Washington, grabs his gun, and somersaults
     into the air...


     ANGLE ON GORDON AND CARRIAGE - WEST

     lands squarely in the back. And just as the rope starts
     to stretch around his neck again, Gordon whirls around
     with a Bowie knife and cuts it.

     West leans into Gordon's ear.

                  Hang 'm...!

     Suddenly, there's a VOLLEY of SHOTS from some cracker
     sharpshooters. West responds with an amazing display of
     RAPID-FIRE marksmanship, picking off half a dozen of
     Loveless's shooters, even while the carriage bumps wildly
     on its getaway. BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM!!!

                                WEST
                         (still pissed,
                          to Gordon)
                  Hang'm!?!

                                GORDON
                         (to Rita)
                  Meet my trigger-happy partner,
                  James West... who doesn't seem to
                  realize that my carefully planned
                  diversion gave me the opportunity
                  to search for the missing
                  scientists.

     Now West notices the half-dressed bombshell in the
     carriage.

                                WEST
                  Scientist, huh.

                                GORDON
                  This is Rita. I found her locked
                  in a cage in Loveless's bedroom.
                  She's an entertainer.

                                RITA
                  Um, maybe I haven't been quite
                  honest about that... My name is
                  Rita Escobar. I came to find
                  Guillermo Escobar, the scientist,
                  my... father.

     Gordon's eyes pop.

                                 GORDON
                  Professor Escobar?! He was the
                  one I almost rescued that night
                  when...
                          (lightbulb)
                  That's where I know you from!

     Gordon starts singing the song... West rolls his eyes,
     cuts off the chit-chat.

                                WEST
                  Look, Rita, I'm sorry you had the
                  wrong agent working on your case.
                  When I find your father I promise
                  I'll send him back safely...

     And with that... West suddenly leaps over Rita -- lands
     on the back of one of the horses. He grabs a handful of
     mane, leans over and unclips the harness. And with a
     kick in the ribs, West is off at a gallop -- leaving
     Gordon, one remaining horse and an awed Rita behind to
     chew his dust.

                                RITA
                  He's impulsive, James.


69   EXT. OFFSHORE - LOVELESS BOAT - NIGHT                           69

     Dr. Loveless and his visiting foreign dignitaries are
     sipping champagne. One of them is holding a little DOG
     in his arms, BARKING at something in the dark. General
     McGrath stands at the railing, uncharacteristically
     pensive. Loveless rolls over, hands him a glass of
     champagne.

                                LOVELESS
                  Well, General, it's been a long
                  journey from New Liberty.

     McGrath visibly winces at the sound of it.

                                McGRATH
                  Sir, there isn't a day that passes
                  that I don't contemplate it.

                                LOVELESS
                  Yes, and so do I. So do I.
                         (reflexively reaches
                          for missing legs)
                  If I'd only had the scientific
                  understanding of gunpowder and
                  primers that I have today...

                  That's not what I meant.

     Loveless looks at him, puzzled, then gets it.

                                LOVELESS
                  Oh, you mean the stomach-churning
                  carnage that earned you your
                  unfortunate nom de guerre...

     Loveless speaks for the benefit of the others.

                                LOVELESS
                  What was that nickname again?

                                McGRATH
                         (reluctantly)
                  'Bloodbath' McGrath... the Butcher

70   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - MARSH - NIGHT                       70

     A reb battalion waits in a foggy meadow that slopes down
     to marsh. Beyond that is the Gulf of Mexico. We
     recognize one of the REBS from the cathouse. He opens
     his pocket watch.

                                REB #1
                  They oughta be here by now.

                                REB #2
                  Maybe we're in the wrong place.

                                REB #1
                         (rechecks map)
                  No, we're supposed to wait 'xactly
                  on this here spot.

     Suddenly they hear a CLANKING and SCREECHING coming from
     the marsh. They ready their arms and get in defensive
     positions. What they can't see through the fog is...


     ANGLE - MARSH - ARMORED TANK

     amphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds,
     passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the
     center of the field. The contraption has a large cannon
     and Gatling guns bristling from several ports. The Rebs
     cheer their new weapon.

71   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT                    71

     Now a MORTAR appears through the turret and FIRES a
     ROCKET that EXPLODES over the Reb soldiers, illuminating
     the field. As soldiers shield their eyes from the
     blinding light...


     ANGLE - AERIAL SHOT - LOOKING DOWN ON FIELD

     Unbeknownst to the Rebs, Loveless has mowed and stained
     the field with concentric lines to give it a giant dart
     board appearance.

     Suddenly the TANK TURRET OPENS FIRE on them. Once over
     their initial shock, the Rebs FIRE BACK with their
     Springfield RIFLES. But the BULLETS PING off the tank's
     impenetrable skin like goober peas.


72   EXT. OFFSHORE - LOVELESS BOAT - NIGHT                          72

     Lippenreider is viewing the carnage through large
     binoculars on a stand.

     General McGrath turns from the rail and faces Loveless,
     outraged.

                             McGRATH
               Why you sawed-off sadistic
               bastard! You've betrayed us!

     Loveless turns to him, cocks his head.

                             LOVELESS
               My dear General, after donating
               half my physical being creating a
               weapon capable of doing this...
               how did you and General Lee repay
               my loyalty? You surrendered at
               Appomattox! So, who betrayed whom?

     Loveless turns to Munitia holding a steno pad.

                             LOVELESS
               Munitia, make note. Turret speed
               needs to be accelerated!

                             MUNITIA
                      (to Amazonia)
               Change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8!

     Amazonia pushes a sick dignitary away from the rail so
     she can get a sight line to the tank with her lantern
     semaphore. She begins flashing the new gear ratio.

     Now in the b.g., we hear the GATLINGS OPEN UP.
     Lippenreider is reading the lips of the tank's victims.

                               LIPPENREIDER
                  Scream. Scream. My head. I'm
                  dying. Scream. Moan. Scream.

                                McGRATH
                  Loveless, I demand you give the
                  order to stop this slaughter now!

                                LOVELESS
                         (ignores him)
                  ... We're going to need more
                  loading drills! I'm hearing too
                  much time between screams.

     As Munitia scribbles dutifully, McGrath shoves her aside.
     He pulls his pistol.

                                McGRATH
                  For the last time, give them the
                  order to desist!

     Loveless, his back to him, is seemingly unconcerned at
     having a gun barrel pressed against his skull.

                                LOVELESS
                  General, I understand your
                  distress. But believe me, those
                  men are not dying senselessly. It
                  is for a far greater cause than
                  you can imagine.

     As Loveless's right index finger finds a black button on
     the arm of his wheelchair...


     CLOSE ANGLE - LOVELESS'S WHEELCHAIR ARM

     The steel tubes that comprise the armrests are actually
     shotgun barrels facing fore and aft. McGrath's finger

     BOOOM!!! McGrath has a very startled expression as he
     looks down at the aftereffects of DOUBLE-OUGHT BUCKSHOT.
     As he crumples to the deck, Loveless sniffs.

                                LOVELESS
                  Bloodbath McGrath indeed.

     The dignitary's DOG starts BARKING, jumps to the deck.
     It sits next to the fallen General's gramophone ear and
     cocks his head. With the RCA logo invented we MOVE BACK

     He sighs at his pale guests. They don't seem to
     appreciate the efficiency of his slaughter.

                  But, my friends, that tank is just

73   EXT. TRAIN SIDING (NEAR MALHEUREUX POINT) - NIGHT                 73

     A black waits ominously on the tracks. It's less a
     traditional train car than a riveted, armored, turreted fortress
     on wheels. Also, it currently lacks an engine.

     Loveless, over his shoulder to the foreign contingent...

     He looks dotingly at the TANK, which CLATTERS up from the
     battlefield on its treads... then drives onto the tracks.
     Wheels drop down out of the chassis, the treads retract
     up, and the TANK BACKS INTO the rest of the TRAIN.
     CLANK. It's a neat modular fit. Black death on rails.

     The foreigners watch with awe as...


     ANGLE - LOVELESS

     wheels up onto the tank/train. He drops the
     expansiveness, fixes them with a viper's eye.

                  If you don't want to miss the

                  gold in my hands no later than

                          of his hat)
                  Au revoir, adios, and ta-ta!


74   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - BATTLEFIELD - STRAIGHT-DOWN             74
     ANGLE - NIGHT

     It's quiet.    The dead men are all in the #9 or #10 ring.

     Now a rider ENTERS FRAME...


75   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT                     75

     West slowly dismounts, transfixed by the slaughter on the
     pre-fab battlefield. There's something hauntingly familiar
     about all this for him -- the mangled bodies, the tread marks...
     But we'll find out about that later.

     West draws his weapon and begins walking through the
     victims. The pace of his search quickens when he isn't
     finding what he's looking for -- General McGrath.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

     NEW ANGLE - GORDON AND RITA

     have arrived in the one-horse carriage. Gordon is trying
     to recreate the crime scene. Rita trails behind him, his
     coat thrown over her shoulders, trying not to gag as she
     passes the mangled corpses.

                                GORDON
                  It came up out of the lake...
                  from the way these corpses are
                  positioned, laid down a 360-degree
                  pattern of cannon fire... then
                  disappeared in moments.
                         (puts a foot on a body,
                          scratches his chin)
                  My God, what kind of weapon is it?

     Rita can't handle Gordon's clinical posturing.

                                RITA
                  Excuse me, I think I'm going to be
                  sick.

     As she walks quickly away, West comes over, a haunted
     look on his face.

                                WEST
                  It just rolls on and on. Makes a
                  screeching sound -- like a wounded
                  animal. Got a 'cabin' on top with
                  a cannon... swivels 'round like an
                  eagle's head.

                                GORDON
                  You saw it?

                                WEST
                  Heard about it. Thought it was
                  crazy survivors' stories.

                                GORDON
                  What survivors? There aren't any
                  here.

                                WEST
                  New Liberty, Illinois -- the free
                  slave town just over the border.
                  Just one week before the War ended
                  in '65. I was in the 9th Cavalry
                  that discovered it. Old men,
                  women, children... they used them
                  for target practice...

     He looks out at the battlefield as if reliving it.
     Gordon is sympathetic to his obvious pain -- just shuts
     up. West's grim reverie is interrupted by MOANING coming
     from the shoreline. They all follow the sound to find...


76   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - MARSH - NIGHT                          76

     General McGrath, washed up on the shore. West looks down
     at him. Now Rita, still looking green around the gills,
     rejoins the party.

                                WEST
                  That's when I vowed to follow
                  McGrath to the end of the earth.

     As grey as four-day-old mullet, McGrath manages a smile
     for his relentless pursuer.

                                McGRATH
                         (barely audible)
                  What's the matter, West? Thought
                  you'd be happy to find me... like
                  this.

                                WEST
                  I was hoping to kill you myself.

                                RITA
                  That's a nice way to talk to
                  people.

                                McGRATH
                  You'll have to live with it... As
                  I've lived with the blame for New
                  Liberty.

     McGrath fades out.    West grabs him and shakes him.

                                WEST
                  What do you mean?

                                McGRATH
                         (opens eyes)
                  It was Loveless... his plan. He
                  operated the killing machine
                  there. Smarter now... left it to
                  others here.

     With the meaning of it all sinking in, West grabs McGrath
     by the collar and pulls him toward him.

                                 WEST
                  Where is he?   Where did he go?!

     The General tries to speak. West puts his ear to the
     General's mouth. But before he can say it, McGrath
     closes his eyes for the last time.

     West's shoulders sag.    Then from behind...

                                RITA (O.S.)
                  Well, I know that.

     West turns to her... well?

                                RITA
                  I'll tell you if you take me
                  along.

                                WEST
                         (in no mood)
                  Just tell me.

                                RITA
                  The girls at the mansion. They
                  talk.

     West and Gordon climb up onto the Wanderer and enter...


78   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - ENGINE STOPPED - NIGHT             78

     West and Gordon burst in, surprising Coleman, who's got
     his feet up, perusing the Playboy of the day -- a mail
     order catalogue.

                                WEST
                  Coleman... let's go!    Full speed
                  ahead!

     West snatches the catalogue out of his hands, does a take
     at the pictures of chunky models in bloomers.

                                COLEMAN
                  Aye, sir!

     As Coleman quickly exits, Gordon looks out the window,
     onto the platform.

                                GORDON
                         (wistful)
                  I don't see why we couldn't have
                  given her a ride back home to
                  Texas. It is on the way...

                                WEST
                  On the way to Utah where our
                  President happens to be. Maybe we
                  oughta be worryin' about that
                  little coincidence!

                                GORDON
                  We wouldn't have known where
                  Loveless was going if it wasn't
                  for her. Seems a bit ungracious.
                  Possibly perilous.

                                WEST
                  Look, all that would happen would
                  be she'd get in our way and I'd
                  probably wind up gettin' in the
                  saddle with her.

                                GORDON
                  Funny that you say that. Because
                  I thought she was more interested
                  in me.

     Rita disappears from view in a cloud of steam...


82   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - NIGHT                             82

     West has every weapon on the train out for cleaning and
     loading. Gordon is in the galley where he continues
     his conversation with West while preparing dinner.

                                GORDON (O.S.)
                         (from gallery)
                  You know, I've been trying to
                  place myself in Loveless's
                  shoes...

                                WEST
                  Good luck on that one.

                                GORDON
                         (weakly)
                  Ha, ha, ha... You know, I can't
                  imagine what Loveless -- a man
                  without any reproductive organs
                  could possibly want with Rita.

     Suddenly there's a WHOOSH and Rita falls through the
     ceiling and plops in the chair just like West did
     earlier. He instinctively pulls his gun. Puts it
     away as Gordon muses about her anatomy.

                                 GORDON (O.S.)
                         (not realizing she's
                          there)
                  Not that Rita doesn't have a
                  figure that would inspire a
                  Botticelli... or a Raphael.

     Rita raises an eyebrow, looks to the galley as Gordon
     comes out with a platter of food. He still doesn't
     see her there.

                                GORDON
                  ... especially her breasts. Did
                  you notice the way one of them...
                         (cups his hands)
                  Both of them actually... to say
                  nothing of her buttocks...

     Gordon turns and looks into the car. Finally sees her.
     Changes gears without missing a beat.

                                GORDON
                  ... and the group of foreign
                  ministers at Loveless's party...
                  What were they doing there?

     Gordon gestures for West to join him at the pool table.
     Rita immediately goes for the food.

                  Here's France, Spain and
                  Britain...
                         (sotto voce)

                                WEST
                  Since the first breast.

     Gordon turns to her, exasperated with himself.

                                GORDON
                  I am so embarrassed.

                                WEST
                  I'll spare you.
                         (to Rita)

                  you know? Something about a
                  real bad deal in Louisiana on
                  purpose.

                                GORDON
                  The Louisiana Purchase?

                                GORDON
                  Queen Isabella of Spain.

     West rolls his eyes.

                                WEST
                  Gordon, this is crazy. She
                  doesn't know what she's talking
                  about!

     West picks up the speaker horn and calls Coleman.

                                WEST
                         (into speaker horn)

                  Not out here in the middle of
                  nowhere.

     West looks out the window. Nothing but sagebrush and
     animal skulls out there. Rita comes up close to Jim,
     fire in her big, brown eyes.

                                RITA
                  Please, Jim. My father's the only
                  family I've got. What am I
                  supposed to do? Sit home and wait
                  for news he's been killed? Or go
                  do something! What would you do,
                  Jim?!

     That gets the man of action where he lives.

                                WEST
                  Look, I got nothing against you,
                  Rita. It's just that... What's
                  going to happen when we catch up
                  to Loveless... with you on the
                  train?

     She grabs West's hand.

                                RITA
                  I know you'd never let him take me
                  back. I've seen you shoot.

     West kinda melts a little. This girl does have her
     charms. Gordon, a little jealous, puffs his chest out.

                                GORDON
                  I assure you, Rita, an attack by
                  Loveless would be an exercise in
                  futility.
                         (stands for tour)
                  ... Allow me to demonstrate how my
                  design suggestions have made the
                  Wanderer impervious to attack.

     West draws his guns, twirls them and reholsters.

                                WEST
                  I'm the impervious part.

     Artemus raps his knuckles on the wall making a METALLIC
     sound. Then he smugly demonstrates that the light
     fixture is actually a Gatling gun.

                                GORDON
                  An attacker would find the
                  lighting inside extremely...
                  unflattering.

     Finally he moves to the billiard table, while Rita nods
     ... and keeps eating.

                                GORDON
                  And if, by some inconceivable
                  fluke, they did manage to gain

                          into bumper)

                  sleeping gas bomb. Effective in
                  under three seconds.

     Gordon unclicks it, triumphantly rolls it into a pocket.

                                GORDON
                  So rest assured, Rita... you are
                  completely safe within these
                  walls.

     West snorts at his obvious play for Rita's attentions.

                                 WEST
                  I don't know about you, ma'am, but
                  I know I'll be sleeping a whole
                  lot better tonight...
                         (yawns)

                  here and feels like a game of
                  pool.

                                RITA
                  Speaking of sleeping, I'm pretty
                  tired. Artemus, do you think I
                  could borrow something to wear?

     West jumps in before Gordon can answer.

86   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - NIGHT                                 86

     West and Gordon have bunked down on opposite couches,
     both deep in thought.

                                WEST
                  Loveless kidnapped two chemists,
                  that means there's gonna be
                  explosives. He's got a metallurgist,
                  so there's gonna be heavy armor.
                  And he's got Rita's father, who --
                  according to you -- is the world's
                  foremost specialist in hydraulics.
                  Which means, whatever it is... it's
                  gonna move.

     West sits up.

                                WEST
                  So what, is he building that's
                  gonna make the President fall to
                  his knees and surrender the country?

                                GORDON

                  Rita. She    needs a bedside heater.
                  I mean, it   gets cold in there, you

     Gordon and West react as Coleman's voice booms out of
     the pipe.

                                COLEMAN (V.O.)
                         (over pipe)
                  We have Loveless, gentlemen!
                  Seven hundred yards and closing!

     As they scramble for boots, weapons, Rita comes out of her
     room.

                                RITA
                  What's going on?

     Gordon ushers her to the back.

                                GORDON
                  Stay back here, take cover!

     Meanwhile, West pulls on his boot. When he stands on it,
     a three-inch STILETTO SNAPS out of the toe.

                                WEST
                  What the hell is this?

                                GORDON
                  I took the liberty of installing
                  it while you were sleeping.

     West looks at him incredulously.

                                WEST
                  Leave my stuff alone!

89     EXT. MOUNTAIN TUNNEL - TRACKS - TRAIN CHASE - DAY              89

       Loveless's TANK/TRAIN CHUGS into a mountain tunnel. The
       Wanderer is just behind it... and goes into the tunnel
       seconds later.


90     EXT. OTHER SIDE OF TUNNEL - TRACKS - TRAIN CHASE - DAY         90

       The Wanderer BLASTS out of the tunnel. (In the f.g. we
       might notice a metal post that extends up OUT OF FRAME.)


91     INT. WANDERER - ENGINE - DAY                                   91

       Coleman squints ahead.   He sees the tracks up ahead are
       empty. No Loveless.

       Up on metal stilts. It lets the Wanderer pass underneath
       it. Then it lowers itself back down onto the tracks.
       The legs fold to the side, and the tank/train pursues its
       pursuers.

                   Then perhaps you could explain
                   what they're doing behind us.

      As West looks out the back too... KA-BOOM!! A SHELL
      EXPLODES just to the right of them. Now ANOTHER
      EXPLOSION to the left of them. The Wanderer rocks
      precariously from wheel to wheel, throwing a screaming
      Rita back and forth between West and Gordon.

                                 WEST
                   They couldn't fire the cannon at

      With a shrug, Gordon tosses West a rope and hits the
      same hidden button he had during their fight. Whoosh!
      West is gone as the pool table flips over. As Rita
      covers her mouth in amazement...

      West hanging upside-down. He hand-over-hands himself
      back to the escape trolley. He slides his back on top of
      it -- then lowers it onto the track.

      Little wheels fit on the inside of the track. Once
      coupled, West releases the cable and he shoots backwards
      -- OUT OF FRAME.

102   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                               102

      Gordon opens a panel in the floor and snaps up a winch
      with a large handle. He starts to crank it, slowly
      letting out cable.

      Suddenly there's a PING! BONG! PING! POP! The TEETH
      of the GEARS can't take the pressure and they're flying
      off the WINCH.


105   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                              105

      Gordon, realizing another invention of his needs some
      tweaking, snaps out his pen and pad. As he scribbles a
      note, Rita considers the exotic pen holder.

                              RITA
                You know you could put a gun on
                that thing.

      Gordon looks up at her disapprovingly... not you too?
      Meanwhile, on the tracks...


106   EXT. TRACKS - TRAIN CHASE - WEST ON TROLLEY - DAY             106

      Off his wire tether, he flies backwards at 80 mph.

      It looks like his head's about to be smashed by
      Loveless's tank/train.


108   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                              108

      Rita turns away, buries her head in Gordon's shoulder
      just as...


109   EXT. TRACKS - TRAIN CHASE - DAY                               109

      West slides under the train! He lies flat as the death
      MACHINE ROARS over him. At the last second, he lassos
      the rope around the rear axle. It slows him for a
      beat... then stretches. He's gotten Gordon's trick rope.
      We see his silent scream -- "Artemus!" He slides way
      behind the tank/train, then springs back... past the
      tank/train. Finally, West slides back underneath and
      manages to grab hold of their caboose. He swings his
      legs up, pulls himself around onto the step.

      THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 6/15/98                       70.

110   EXT. LOVELESS'S TRAIN - ROOF - MOVING - DAY                   110

      West makes his way forward to the smokestack. He tries
      to flip the flue closed, steam scalding his hands. He
      doesn't see Hudson come at him from behind. He wraps a
      garrote around West's neck, pulls it tight -- practically
      crushing his larynx...


111   INT. LOVELESS'S TRAIN - ENGINE - DAY                          111

      Munitia is bent over, has her eye to the cannon sight.
      As she squints through the smoke at the Wanderer up ahead,
      Loveless, sitting behind her, has his full attention
      focused on her tuchus.

                              MUNITIA
                I have them square in my sights,
                sire.

                              LOVELESS
                       (distracted)
                As do I, Munitia... as do I.
                       (looks up, wry smile)
                Fire away!

      But it's a little difficult with him stroking her
      buttocks. BOOM! The CANNON FIRES...

113   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                              113

      Gordon and Rita are looking out the back when they see
      the latest missile headed their way. Gordon pulls Rita
      down at the last second as a huge steel arrow shoots
      through the door, past their heads... and into the parlor
      wall.

      As metal barbs flick out, locking the tip in, and the
      steel chain it's attached to draws tight...


114   EXT. LOVELESS'S TRAIN - ROOF - MOVING - DAY                   114

      West and Hudson roll around precariously. West claws
      desperately at the garrote. It looks grim for our hero
      until he knocks his boot heels together. CLICK... his
      STILETTO BLADE appears.

      Summoning his last ounce of strength, he mule-kicks...
      sinking the blade into Hudson's leg. West grabs him and
      shoves him head first into the smokestack. The big
      Indian plugs it up like a cork in a bottle.

                                                               71.

115   INT. LOVELESS'S TRAIN - ENGINE - DAY                           115

      Loveless has only a moment to gloat over his marksmanship
      before the compartment begins filling with smoke.
      Choking clouds that send Loveless et al into coughing
      fits.

                              LOVELESS
                Close the fire door!

      Just in time, Amazonia swings it shut as the unvented
      BOILER EXPLODES, sending a FIREBALL ripping through the
      back of the train, destroying it. Up ahead...


116   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                               116

      Gordon and Rita are thrown across the car, along with
      everything else inside, as Loveless's train's sudden
      stop... jerks them with it. The SCREECH of STEEL WHEELS
      SCRAPING on IRON RAILS is sickening. They clutch onto
      one another... as the Wanderer skids to a stop.

      As they pick themselves up, Gordon looks to Rita who's
      shaken up and scared. Now FOOTSTEPS coming up the
      stairs.

                              RITA
                I won't let Loveless take me
                again! I'd rather be dead!

                               GORDON
                       (recalling West's
                        words)
                That's not a good one to wish for.

      To defend herself, Rita grabs one of the sleeping-gas
      pool balls rolling around on the ground. Gordon leads
      her into the stateroom to lock her in, but she grabs his
      hand.

                              RITA
                Please, Artemus, don't leave me
                alone!

      Rita closes the door behind him and locks it.


117   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - STATEROOM - DAY                   117

      Gordon and Rita on the bed. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH. Gordon
      gestures to be still. The door handle jiggles. Rita gets
      ready to arm the POOL BALL.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                          (hoarsely, not
                           sounding like him)
                   It's me, Jim. Open up!

                                 RITA
                   It's a trick, I know Loveless.

      CLICK, she pushes the number.     Gordon makes a grab for
      it.

                                  GORDON
                   Rita, no!   It's just...

      CLUNK... she drops it to the floor.


      ANGLE - WEST

      standing in the doorway. He rubs a raw welt on his neck
      from the garrote, smirks when he sees Gordon on the bed
      with Rita. But his smirk drops when he sees the pool
      ball roll between his feet -- spewing a purple cloud of
      sleeping gas.

      West gives Gordon a Wile E. Coyote look, croaks...

                                 WEST
                   Too damn late, is what it is.

      A sea of corn tassels waving in the wind. Loveless's
      destroyed train is in the b.g. The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to
      find...


      ANGLE ON WEST AND GORDON

      lying on the ground with their BACKS TO us. They stir.
      West props himself up, looks over at Gordon, who has just
      regained consciousness.

                                 WEST
                          (mimicking him)
                   An innocent billiard ball this
                   way, but depress the number and on
                   impact... a sleeping-gas bomb.

      West shakes his head disparagingly and stands. He feels
      the metal band around his neck and surveys the 18-inch
      wire fence which has been laid around them in a circle.
      West is about to step over it. Gordon grabs his leg.

119   EXT. WANDERER - BACK PLATFORM - DAY                            119

      Loveless is sitting in his wheelchair, fifty yards from
      West and Gordon. On Loveless's elbow sits Miss
      Lippenreider. She looks through binoculars and lip reads
      West and Gordon.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Continue, Miss Lippenreider...

                                 MISS LIPPENREIDER
                          (doing both voices
                           in a monotone)
                   West. Let go of my leg! Gordon.
                   Listen to me. Loveless collared
                   us with the same metal device we
                   found on Morton.

      Loveless turns to Munitia, who is loading two 36-inch-
      diameter metal discs into what looks like a CD
      changer/clay-pigeon-thrower.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Oh, Munitia... I hope we're not
                   going to leave evidence behind
                   like we did last time.

                                 MUNITIA
                   Nitro this time, sire.

      As she arms the device, and a red light comes on...

                                 LOVELESS
                          (through megaphone)
                   Good morning, gentlemen! I trust
                   you slept well.


120   EXT. CORNFIELD - PERIMETER - DAY                               120

      West and Gordon squint through the corn, see Loveless on
      their train.

                                 GORDON
                   What have you done with Rita?

                                 LOVELESS
                   Rita, is it? How familiar! Rita
                   is sleeping off the after-effects
                   in the stateroom.
                          (looks toward bedroom)
                   Quite lovely, isn't she? Who
                   knows... I might even become
                   'familiar' with her myself.

      Gordon takes a step.    West stops him.

                                 WEST
                   And that would become one more
                   reason why I'm going to kill you.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Yes, Mr. West, I'm sure a well-
                   endowed blackamoor like yourself
                   must find it absolutely
                   impossible... that a freak like me
                   could fully enjoy the pleasure of
                   a woman. But having witnessed my
                   use of mechinology so far...
                   wouldn't you think I could provide
                   myself with something for the
                   lower half of my body that was
                   hard-pumping and indefatigably
                   steely?

      Loveless looks O.S.

                                 LOVELESS
                   ... And speaking of 'hard

      Loveless takes his last shot at them from the back.

                                 LOVELESS
                   What a marvelous train! You don't
                   mind if I borrow it, do you,

                                 LOVELESS (CONT'D)
                   Other than a lack of wheelchair
                   access, I find it a most
                   comfortable way to pass the long
                   miles from here to my laboratory
                   in Spider Canyon...
                          (louder, as they

                   I'll be seeing President Grant
                   soon at Promontory Point. What
                   shall I tell him for you? I'm
                   afraid it can't be that you're
                   alive and well...

      And as his maniacal giggle hangs in the air...


123   EXT. CORNFIELD - PERIMETER - GORDON AND WEST - DAY             123

      frustrated, as the train pulls away from them.    West tugs
      at the metal collar around his neck.

                                 WEST
                   Gordon, get out your little tool
                   kit and get this damn thing off of
                   me!

      Gordon unbuttons his shirt to reveal his leather tool
      kit... empty except for a note. Gordon opens it and
      reads.

                                 GORDON
                   'Gentlemen, welcome to the
                   Loveless Experimental Camp for

      Miss Lippenreider is still eavesdropping for Loveless,
      through binos.

                                 MISS LIPPENREIDER
                   West. How do you know it's not
                   just bullshit? Gordon. Step over
                   the fence and find out. Rita and
                   I will put flowers on your grave
                   every year.

                                                               76.

      stands next to the little fence, watching Loveless
      escape.

                              WEST
                I don't have time for this.

                              GORDON
                Wait, I have an auxiliary tool
                kit!

      Gordon peels back the top of his boot revealing it. But
      it's too late. West has jumped over the fence. Then he
      hops back inside it. He holds his hands out to Gordon.

                                 WEST
                See?     Nothing happened.

      West grabs Gordon by the back of his vest and yanks him
      over the fence. Now they hear a slight BUZZING in the
      air and it's not a bee.


      NEW ANGLE - DISC

      comes whipping over the corn straight for West's head.
      In a split second, he ducks and the disc cuts the tops of
      the corn off and banks around for a new attack.

                                 GORDON
                Oh, really...?

      Now both of them step over the fenced perimeter and start
      running like hell through the cornfield.

                              WEST
                Is it too late to take it off of
                me now?

      The second disc machine light turns green and the second
      disc is launched.


127   EXT. CORNFIELD - WANDERER BACK PLATFORM - MOVING - DAY         127

      Loveless is laughing his head off. Certain of Gordon's
      and West's impending death, he rolls his wheelchair
      inside.

       is awakening from the effects of the billiard ball gas
       and tries to control her sense of dread and loathing.
       She smiles nervously at Loveless, who's being fawned-over
       by his women.

                 Rita, my dear, not that I'm
                 ungrateful to Providence for
                 bringing you back to me...

       Rita jumps as the champagne CORK POPS.

                               LOVELESS
                 ... I'm just a wee bit curious as
                 to how you managed to wind up with
                 them.

                               RITA
                        (scrambling)
                 Well, they uh... seemed so... sure
                 that they could find you... and I
                 thought if I stayed with them...
                 they'd lead me back to... all my
                 friends...

       Munitia shoots a look at Lippenreider.

                         to Loveless)
                 I kinda missed you.

                               LOVELESS
                        (not buying it)
                 Isn't that a coincidence?    I miss
                 me, too.

       come running TOWARD us. Behind and above are two discs
       about to make a dive at them.

      The discs, like giant razors, are mowing off the tops of
      the corn stalks, heading straight for their heads!

      West and Gordon dive to the ground... the discs just
      missing them. West stands to run again. We see the back
      of his head's been buzzed.


129   EXT. CORNFIELD - AERIAL SHOT - WEST AND GORDON - DAY              129

      running a zigzag pattern toward the end of the cornfield.
      West sees a gully fifty yards ahead of them.

                                 GORDON
                   Head for that gully!

      West zigs out of the cornfield one way. Gordon zags out
      the other. They're both beat-up and exhausted from
      running and flopping on the ground.

131   EXT. RIVER CANYON - GORDON'S POV - DAY                            131

      It's no gully. It's a canyon that drops 100 feet down
      to a ribbon of brown water. And that's not the worst of
      it...


132   EXT. RIVER CANYON NEAR CORNFIELD - DAY                            132

      West is on the other side of the precipice.       They're
      separated by about 15 feet of air.

      They both see the discs closing in.       Think fast.

                                 WEST
                   When I give the signal.   Jump off
                   the cliff into my arms.

                                 GORDON
                   Are you crazy?! Do you see what's
                   down there?

                                 WEST

      West holds out his arms.

      West takes a leap of faith... and finally, so does
      Gordon.

                                  GORDON
                   Oh shit!

      meeting mid-air. They drop OUT OF FRAME, just as... the
      two discs collide with a MIGHTY EXPLOSION that is heard

      Loveless raises his glass to Rita, makes a little kissing
      gesture. She looks like she'd like to kill herself.

      They drop OUT OF FRAME and we hear a LOUD THUK THUK.

A137   EXT. STREAM - DUSK                                             A137

       West and Gordon, caked in mud, are coming up a ridge,
       below which is a stream.

                               WEST
                 All right, Gordon, what's your
                 plan? How are you gonna get this
                 damn thing off my neck?

       Gordon turns to West, simmering, controlling himself.

                               GORDON
                 Excuse me?

                               WEST
                 Isn't that why you're here?
                 'Cause you're the master of,
                 you know, mechanical stuff?

                               GORDON
                        (smiles)
                 Oh. Oh, I see. Now I'm the master
                 of... 'mechanical stuff.' As opposed
                 to five minutes ago, when I was trying
                 to collect my thoughts and figure
                 out a way to get us out of these
                 contraptions! But no!

       Gordon starts moving towards West, who is forced to back
       up -- looking a tad nervous for the first time in the
       movie.

                               GORDON
                 -- That wouldn't have been any
                 fun for a certain somebody, and I
                 won't mention any names -- Jim
                 West! -- who decided to take me on
                 a bracing romp through a cornfield
                 and play a fanciful game of hide
                 and seek with serrated, spinning
                 death discs, while our only mode
                 of transportation is in the hands
                 of a sadistic madman with weapons
                 of mass destruction, who kidnapped
                 Rita, and is on his way to kill
                 our President and take over the
                 country!

                    help YOU! Because you're the

                    Oh, but I do.

       Gordon grabs a rock and smashes West's collar.
       Suddenly --

       ZIIIINNG! West's collar emits a LOW HUM. Suddenly,
       West is thrown into Gordon, their collars locking.
       CLANG!

                                  GORDON
                           (suddenly calm)
                    That's odd. What did you do?

                                  WEST
                    I didn't do shit!

                    No, you must've reversed the

                           (he's had enough)
                    That's it --

       West lifts his leg to Gordon's collar to push him
       away, but then -- CLANG! The stiletto in his shoe
       dislodges and instantly sticks to Gordon's magnetic
       collar.

       For a mega-millisecond, West -- his foot stuck to his
       partner's neck -- is stunned. But before he knows what
       even happened, West flips upside down onto his shoulders.

                                  GORDON
                    Are you all right?

                                  WEST
                    Oh, I'm peachey. Now help me get
                    my boot off!

       First, Gordon -- trying to get some leverage -- puts his
       foot in West's crotch and pulls the boot.

                                   WEST
                    Ahhhh!

                    Apologies, apologies.

       Gordon struggles to free the writhing West from the boot
       (attached to Gordon's collar).

       Finally, West's foot comes free. But when he sits up
       -- THWAP! His collar is sucked into Gordon's belt buckle.
       West is face to face with his partner's crotch.

                                  WEST
                    Do me a favor. When you're

                    Don't worry.

       West starts unbuttoning Gordon's belt.

                                  WEST
                    Now, when I undo your belt,
                    I'm going to run as fast as I

       The men run in opposite directions. (Gordon's belt on
       West's collar, West's boot on Gordon's). They get about
       thirty, forty yards. Then --

       They're yanked backwards into each other.

       SPLASH! They fall in the water -- back to back. Every
       time one rolls up and catches his breath, the other is

       Finally they roll out of the stream and onto dry land.
       They sit up, out of breath, stuck together, back to back.

                                  WEST
                    I do not want to spend the rest
                    of my life looking like a meatball
                    on a plate.

                                  GORDON
                    We're going to have to discuss
                    bathroom etiquette soon. Very
                    soon.

       ANGLE ON TOOL KIT

       bobbing in the stream.    Gordon grabs it out of the water.

                                  GORDON
                    Aha. My auxiliary tool kit.
                    I forgot all about it. It must've
                    slipped out of my pocket.

                                  WEST
                    Your pocket? Why wasn't it
                    attached to some spring-loaded
                    something-or-other that shoots
                    out of your ass?

       Gordon, lips parched, clothes tattered, peers impatiently
       over the metal collar as West works on it with some lock
       picks. West's collar is already off.

                   Why didn't you tell me you had an
                   'auxiliary' tool kit?

                                 GORDON
                   I did tell you, but in your zeal
                   to run and leap off a two-hundred-
                   foot cliff, I don't think you
                   heard me.

      West eats the grilled Gila monster voraciously. And
      eats. And enjoys it more. And eats. He notices Gordon
      watching him.

                                 WEST
                   What?!

      Gordon looks to the heavens and recites.

                                 GORDON
                   '... Take physic, pomp; Expose
                   thyself to feel what wretches
                   feel, That thou mayst shake the
                   superflux to them, And show the
                   heavens more just.'

      Gordon's quote has gone on.       And on.   And on.   He notices
      West watching him.

                                 GORDON
                   What?!

                                 WEST
                   You know, Gordon, you can be quite
                   annoying -- flaunting that fancy
                   education.

                                 GORDON
                   Well, truth be told, I never had a
                   fancy education -- not a formal
                   one, anyway.

                                 WEST

                   The Harvard thing seems pretty
                   formal to me.

                                 GORDON
                   This ring? This ring isn't real.

                   A prop. I'm an actor. Or was. I
                   gave it up. I went by the name of
                   Arthur Gordon. Ever hear of me?

                                 WEST
                   No. How did you wind up in this
                   line of work?

                                 GORDON
                   The pinnacle of my life in the
                   theater came in a production of
                   Our American Cousin -- a light
                   comedy -- at Ford's Theater in
                   Washington. There was this one
                   line I had... always got the
                   biggest laugh in the show. One
                   night, it drowned out the
                   gunshot that killed President
                   Lincoln.
                          (beat)
                   I decided to devote my talents to

                   again.


      CLOSE - TARANTULA

      walks slowly across West's outstretched hand.

                                 GORDON
                   Uh... There's a spider on your
                   hand. Doesn't that bother you?

                                 WEST
                   She doesn't want any trouble.
                   She's just trying to get warm.

      He puts the spider down into the sand.

                                 GORDON
                   How come you know so much about
                   the desert, anyway?

                                 WEST
                   The Indians taught me. I lived
                   out here when I was a boy.

      Gordon starts to ask West something but West doesn't want
      him to pry further.

      He points toward a small black wasp flying from above.

                                 WEST
                   The desert wasp... one of the
                   world's great hunters. She'll
                   kill the tarantula -- and lay her
                   eggs on it, so her babies can have
                   something to eat.

                                 GORDON
                   Now I'm really hungry.
                          (beat)
                   How did your parents, who I assume
                   were Negroes, feel about you being
                   raised by Indians?

                                 WEST
                   They didn't have much to say about
                   it. I was sent to another
                   plantation when I was little. Ran
                   away as soon as my legs were
                   strong enough to take me.

      West can see the effect his story has had on Gordon.

                                 GORDON
                   Did you ever see your family

                   They were at the camp at New
                   Liberty.

      Now they both stare into the fire.    Finally Gordon
      speaks.

                                 GORDON
                   I'll help you get him, Jim.


138   EXT. UTAH - DESERT - MORNING                                   138

      West and Gordon trudge through an endless sand dune,
      side by side, chests out, jaws set. They're partners,
      goddammit!

                                  GORDON
                   You have no idea where you're
                   going, do you?

                                 WEST
                   I know exactly where I'm goin'
                   ... Spider Canyon.

      Gordon stops to catch his breath.

                                 WEST
                          (stops, looks back)
                   But I'm never gonna get there
                   with you draggin' that damn
                   thing around!

      Now we see Gordon's got the heavy metal collar in his hand.
      West grabs him and they start to walk away -- Gordon
      listing noticeably.

                                 GORDON
                   While a magneto of this power
                   may not inspire your scientific
                   curiosity, it does mine. Besides,
                   you never know when it might come
                   in handy.

      Gordon suddenly disappears OUT OF FRAME. West stops
      to see what's happened to his partner now...

      ANGLE - GORDON

      He's on his back, arm holding the metal doughnut
      straight out over his head, being dragged across the
      desert floor by some unseen force.

      Gordon snowplows backwards through the sand for 40 feet,
      finally coming to an abrupt stop with a metallic klang!

      West deadpans this bit of insanity, walks over, and with
      the toe of his boot, uncovers the explanation -- iron
      railroad tracks covered by drifting sand.

                                 WEST
                   Arte... when you're right, you're
                   right.

                                 GORDON
                   Well I think our partnership is
                   taking a big step forward. You
                   finally admitted I was right about
                   something.

      West helps him up. Then, as or two heroes follow the
      tracks into the distance... towards Spider Canyon...

                                 GORDON
                   Now... how about admitting you
                   were lost?

139   EXT. SPIDER CANYON RIM - DAY (LATER)                              139

      West and Gordon trudge past the Wanderer.     It's parked
      at the end of the line, looks deserted.

                                 GORDON
                   Jim, I know I've hallucinated
                   it several times before, so is
                   that really the Wanderer?

                                 WEST
                   That's the Wanderer.

      Gordon seems relieved to know his beloved train is not
      another mirage. They continue on to the rim of the
      canyon, peer over the edge. Reacting to what they see...

                                 GORDON
                   And would it be too much to
                   hope that I'm simply seeing a

140   EXT. SPIDER CANYON - POV FROM RIM - DAY                        140

      A natural bowl that appears to have been made by a
      meteor, is gouged out of the desert floor. In the bowl
      are several spectacular Victorian-style buildings made
      almost entirely of glass, plus a huge silo. Ant-sized
      figures are moving around.


141   OMITTED                                                        141


142   EXT. SPIDER CANYON - DAY                                       142

      Now they hear a strange sound. To modern ears, a WHINE
      as from a jet engine. Loveless appears in the f.g. He's
      rising on a steel platform as if on some unseen elevator.
      Up, up, up he goes... as now more of the contraption comes
      INTO VIEW. Alloy girders, multi-levels, control boards...
      all open in an Eiffel Tower-like effect.

      West and Gordon scramble for cover behind a rock as a
      giant metal Tarantula steps over the rim in full
      terrifying glory. Eight legs, five stories high.

      The thorax of the giant spider bristles with Gatling guns
      and all manner of weaponry. As the shadow of the monster
      passes over their faces...

                                 GORDON
                   Now that's impressive.

                                 WEST
                   Nice to see an invention that
                   actually works.


143   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DAY                                  143

      Loveless is sitting in a captain's seat 60 feet in the
      air. He's surrounded by his adoring crew Amazonia,
      Munitia and Lippenreider. He spreads his arms wide,
      world at his feet.

                                                               86.

144   EXT. SPIDER CANYON RIM - ANGLE - GORDON AND WEST - DAY         144

      They watch the Tarantula head toward a narrow opening
      between two red-rock outcroppings.

                              GORDON
                       (dismissive)
                We'll see about that. The fool
                doesn't even realize he's trapped.


145   EXT. MESAS NEAR SPIDER CANYON RIM - DAY                        145

      Suddenly... a VOLLEY OF CANNON FIRE EXPLODES the
      impediment to dust. The Tarantula marches on.

148   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR (STOPPED) - DAY                     148

      West is dressing for battle. He straps his six guns
      on his hips, flips the pool table over, grabs a coach
      gun, tucks that behind his chaps.

      He belts on his shotgun shell bandolero. An extra six
      gun gets tucked in the belt. Another in his boot.
      Pocketfuls of shells. The man's ready for war.

                               WEST
                Gordon, let's ride!
                       (pause)
                You do know how to ride...?

      He sticks his head through the door to...


149   INT. WANDERER - LAB CAR (STOPPED) - DAY                        149

      Gordon's Nitro-cycle is out.   Gordon fusses with it and
      some canvas.

                              WEST
                ... A horse, I mean.

                              GORDON
                       (distracted)
                Yes... I know how to ride a horse.
                When the situation calls for
                something primitive.

149   CONTINUED:                                                   149

                                 WEST
                   How about now? There's a big
                   spider stompin' towards our
                   President!

      But Gordon won't be hurried. He has a big book out,
      studies it, then looks back to his Nitro-cycle.

                                 GORDON
                   I was just thinking about another
                   spider. Remember in the desert,
                   when that little wasp killed the
                   tarantula...?

      West rolls his eyes impatiently.

                                WEST
                   Yeah. Well, the wasp had a small
                   advantage. It could fly.

                                 GORDON
                   Exactly!

      Gordon excitedly shows the book to West. Pictured is an
      archaic sepia diagram of a weird aircraft. West looks at
      it in disbelief as Gordon prattles on manically.

                                 GORDON
                   In 1540, Leonardo Da Vinci
                   invented a flying machine called
                   the 'Ornithopter.' Though he
                   never actually flew it...

      West's heard enough.    He grabs Gordon, shakes him.

                                 WEST
                   Artemus! There's no time for
                   plans or half-cocked inventions!
                   They don't work. We gotta stick
                   to what we're each good at!

      As West drags Gordon to the wardrobe...


150   EXT. DESERT (UTAH) - DAY                                     150

      Two riders galloping TOWARD CAMERA. As they THUNDER
      PAST, we see West is in the lead, jaw set. And right
      behind him comes... President Grant...?! (It's Artemus
      in disguise, of course. And he actually can ride a
      horse.)

      THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 6/15/98                       88.

151   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - CLOSE ON GOLDEN SPIKE - DAY           151

      being held in the stubby fingers of Ulysses S. Grant.
      He's reading an inscription on it.

                              PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.)
                May God continue the unity of our
                country...

      CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a crowd present to watch
      President Grant knock in the famous spike. Behind him,
      two train engines are facing each other. The detectives
      scan the crowd for possible trouble.

                              PRESIDENT GRANT
                ... as this railroad unites the
                two great oceans of this world.

      Now he swings back the sledgehammer... but at the top of
      his swing...


      CLOSE - SPIKE

      starts to shake, wiggle, and actually pop out of its
      hole. Very curious. As it begins to hop on the ground,
      bounced by a RESOUNDING THUMPING...


      ANGLE ON GRANT AND CROWD

      look across the desert to see...


152   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - LONG SHOT - DAY                       152

      The Tarantula in full view. People start screaming
      in terror as it appears over a ridge, huge even at
      this distance. The metal beast closes the 200-yard
      distance in seconds.

      The citizens flee. The detectives are not far behind
      them. The soldiers take cover and ready their weapons.
      Grant stands his ground... even as a huge FOOT CLOMPS
      down in front of him, VIBRATING the CAMERA.


153   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DAY                                 153

      Loveless talks into a microphone which BOOMS his
      voice out through AMPLIFIED SPEAKERS.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Well, isn't this a coincidence!
                   I'm out for a little mornin' ride,
                   and right in the middle of
                   nowhere, I bump into General
                   Ulysses S. Grant himself!
                          (leans over edge,
                           mocking salute)
                   We've never been properly
                   introduced. I'm Dr. Arliss
                   Loveless, formerly with the
                   Confederate Army.


154   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - DAY (INTERCUT WITH TARANTULA            154
      BRIDGE)

      Cool and collected, Grant lights a cigar.

                                  PRESIDENT GRANT
                   Yes, Dr. Loveless, what can I do
                   for you today?
                          (to his military aides)
                   Flank him, left and right.

                                 LOVELESS
                   I have a humble abode nearby, and
                   I hope you'll accept my
                   hospitality. I have a little
                   proposition to make.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                   What proposition is that?

                                 LOVELESS
                   The unconditional and immediate
                   surrender of the United States of
                   America to the Loveless Alliance.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                   I didn't realize we were at war.

      Loveless gives the nod to Munitia.


155   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - DAY                                     155

      KABOOM! The CANNON blows the President's train to
      smithereens.


156   EXT. TARANTULA BRIDGE - DAY                                     156

                   How about now...?


157   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - BEHIND OBLITERATED TRAIN - DAY         157

      The crowd who'd taken refuge behind it runs away in
      panic. All but one of them. A second President Grant
      (Artemus Gordon). He calmly lights a cigar on the
      flaming train, strides up to the other Grant, and
      shouts up at Loveless.

                                 GORDON/GRANT
                   In matters of war, the person to
                   talk to would be me.

      If there's anyone more surprised than the President
      himself it's...


158   EXT. TARANTULA BRIDGE - DAY (INTERCUT WITH PROMONTORY          158
      POINT)

      Loveless, squinting down at the two Grants. This new
      wrinkle has also attracted the attention of the
      Love-lettes and everyone else aboard.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Now just who are you?

                                  GORDON/GRANT
                   The President.
                          (turns to President,
                           snorts)
                   He's just an actor hired to stand
                   in for me on public occasions. A
                   very bad actor, I must say... a
                   little puffy and overweight.

      As the President eyes him, puffs on his cigar,
      Gordon/Grant apes his every move, bigger, mockingly.

                                  PRESIDENT GRANT
                          (aside)
                   Gordon, you've got a lot of brass.
                   Where's West?

                                 GORDON
                   You know him, sir...

      Gordon/Grant shifts his eyes toward...

160   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - REAR OF TARANTULA - DAY                160

      West running undetected to the rear leg. As the lone
      cowboy starts to climb up toward the belly of the beast...


161   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - TWO GRANTS - DAY                       161

      Gordon/Grant turns to an Army officer, standing behind.

                              GORDON/GRANT
                       (loudly)
                Captain, get this man out of my
                sight! And next time get me a
                real actor!

      As the bewildered captain starts to lead the President
      away...


162   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DAY                                  162

      Loveless has had enough.

                              LOVELESS
                Take them both!!!

      Munitia, manning a sort of cannon, takes a bead on
      the two Grants. She pulls the trigger...


163   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - TWO GRANTS - DAY                       163

      ... and a sticky white silk shoots out covering both
      Grants with spider web material.

                              PRESIDENT GRANT
                Well, Gordon... was this part of
                your plan?

                              GORDON
                I'm by your side, sir.   That's
                what's important.

      Now Munitia hits a lever and they're hoisted up off the
      ground. They only get a couple of feet when... BLAM!
      West shoots the mechanism and it jerks to a stop.

      All eyes turn to the source of the sharpshooting...


164   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - TARANTULA LEG - DAY                    164

      West has almost reached the lowest deck. Now all the
      firepower of the Tarantula is trained on him.

                                                                92.

       Amazonia's on the Gatling gun. Munitia and several other
       goons on lower decks OPEN UP on West, too.


166    EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - TARANTULA LEG - DAY                    166

       West takes cover behind the steel girders, SIX-GUNS
       BLAZING. All his GUNS BLAZING.


167    EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - DAY                                    167

       covering FIRE, PING harmlessly against the Tarantula's
       ALLOY SKIN.

      West's body hasn't moved. The only change is that now
      a line of ants crawls across his face. We watch, hoping

      march over lifeless eyes, swarm onto the bloody cut on
      his head. If we're not convinced he's dead...


      ANGLE - VULTURE

      circles lower, finally landing right by West's head.   As
      the hideous carrion-eater leans over West's face...


      EXTREME CLOSEUP - WEST'S EYES

      A shadow falls across them. But instead of the pecking
      red beak, a human hand appears IN the FRAME. Brushes the
      ants away. We hear an INDIAN INCANTATION over. Then
      finally... West's eyelids flutter open.


      WEST'S POV - NAVAJO SHAMAN

      standing over him. BLURRY, back-lit by the sun, the face
      of West's Indian friend. The healer who can turn himself
      into a bird.

      As West sits up groggily, feels his head. Hey, it's
      okay. As he makes a mental note to always be kind to
      animals...


174   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK (SAME TIME)          174

      Loveless continues his speech to the foreign contingent.

                                 LOVELESS
                          (looks to Hudson
                           the indian)
                   Manhattan for a handful of beads?
                          (raises his hand;
                           injun-style)
                   How?
                          (to the Mexicans)
                   Remember the Alamo indeed!
                          (humbly to crowd)
                   Today I'm proud to be able to sit
                   before you and tell you the wrongs
                   will be righted... the past made
                   present... the United, divided!

      To thunderous applause. Loveless signals for the flag to
      be pulled down, revealing...


      ANGLE ON MAP OF "THE DE-UNITED STATES"

      There have been some significant internal changes which
      Loveless now describes. The delegation from each country
      stands when they hear their name.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Great Britain gets back the
                   thirteen original colonies...
                   minus Manhattan.
                          (off applause)
                   Florida and the Fountain of Youth
                   go back to Spain!
                          (off applause)
                   Texas, New Mexico, California,
                   Arizona revolve a Mexico!
                          (off applause)
                   And the Louisiana Purchase reverts
                   back to the King of France!

      In the front row Rita leans over to Gordon.

                                 RITA
                   Queen of Spain. King of France.
                   I was close.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                95.

174   CONTINUED:                                                      174

                           (jostles her)
                   Shut up and listen to a real
                   genius!

      Finally Loveless taps Colorado, Kansas, Utah and Nevada
      -- now labelled as "Loveless Land." Smiles impishly.

                                 LOVELESS
                   And a tiny piece for me to retire
                   on.

      There's appreciative laughter.


175   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - WEST - SAME TIME                   175

      stumbles in and looks around discouraged.

      The place has been ransacked. The gun cabinets are
      empty, the Gatling lamp removed. All that's left is
      Gordon's Nitro-cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses.

      West tries every secret hiding place. Nothing. Finally
      he finds Gordon's belt buckle/derringer. He opens the
      breech. Only one dinky bullet. He throws down the belt
      in disgust.


176   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - LOVELESS - DUSK           176

      sits behind a desk that has been brought to center stage.
      Loveless unrolls a document, signs his half of it.

                                 LOVELESS
                   My partner nations insist that we
                   make this as legal as possible.
                   Personally, I like the symmetry of
                   it. After all wasn't it you who
                   made us sign a surrender at
                   Appomattox?

      Loveless snaps his fingers. Amazonia drags Grant out of
      his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                   Never will I sign that paper,
                   never will the United States ever
                   surrender!

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               96.

176   CONTINUED:                                                     176

                                 LOVELESS
                   Well, sir, we're at loggerheads
                   then, aren't we? And I suppose
                   the threat of death to someone
                   with your valorous war record,
                   would mean nothing.

      Grant sets his jaw intractably.     He's right about that.

                                 LOVELESS
                   ... so, if you still refuse to
                   sign this surrender... we'll start
                   by shooting your man, Gordon.

      Loveless whirls, nods to Amazonia who drags the President
      back to his seat, pulls Gordon out of his. Rita can't
      help her outburst.

                                 RITA
                   Artemus!

      Artemus smiles at her, extremely brave under the
      circumstances. He whispers to Rita and the President.

                                 GORDON
                          (tugs at his vest)
                   Don't worry, I'm wearing the
                   Impermeable.

      Rita turns to Grant. What the hell is that? Gordon has
      no time to explain as Amazonia hauls him up on the stage.
      As Munitia aims her rifle... Gordon holds up a finger.

                                 GORDON
                   If I may have one request... it's
                   that she aim at my heart... which
                   has loved this great country so
                   much!

                                 LOVELESS
                          (considers for a moment)
                   Shoot him in the head.

                                 GORDON
                   Great.

      Munitia cocks her rifle, then just as Loveless holds his
      hands up for the signal to fire... the lights dim...

                                                                 97.

177   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK                       177

      A candle-powered spotlight swings across the stage and
      illuminates... a deep-throated, bluesy black CHANTEUSE
      who starts singing the popular cathouse song, "Hangtown
      Gals."

                                 CHANTEUSE
                          (singing)
                   'Ohhh... Hangtown gals are plump
                   and rosy...'

      Loveless wheels his chair around to take a gander and
      forgets Gordon's execution instantly. And why not?
      She's young and beautiful in a RuPaul sort of way. About
      six feet tall, wearing the blue sequined number Gordon
      had in his dressing room.

      Accessorized with black mesh stockings, big feather boa,
      silver-buckled belt, lots of frilly petticoats for those
      can-can moves.

                                 CHANTEUSE
                          (singing)
                   'Hair in ringlets, mighty cozy...'

      She winds her finger around her ringlets and sticks out
      her derriere to the crowd. They stare, mouths agape at
      this piece of ass worthy of Othello.


      CLOSE - LOVELESS

      Intrigued.    Well, maybe more than intrigued.

                                  LOVELESS
                   A new girl!   What a nice surprise!

      He motions to hold up Gordon's execution, rolls to her.

                                  CHANTEUSE
                   'Painted cheeks and frilly
                   corsets.'
                          (bends over showing
                           her undergarment)
                   Touch them...'

      Loveless hears this as an invitation, reaches out with
      his hand and whap! She slaps him right in the face.

                                 CHANTEUSE
                   '... And they'll sting like
                   hornets!'

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                                98.

177   CONTINUED:                                                      177

      There's a hush in the crowd. Loveless, a red handprint
      on his face, is a little nonplussed. Amazonia moves in
      threateningly, but Loveless stops her, starts to laugh.

                                 LOVELESS
                          (making her name up
                           on the spot)
                   Ebonia! Why are you so cruel to
                   me?

      Ebonia has escaped a head-cutting neck bracelet. But she
      probably shouldn't be teasing a man who's having "ghost
      aches" in certain amputated places.


      ANGLE - GORDON

      waiting to be executed.    Something's not quite kosher
      about her for Gordon.

                                 GORDON
                          (musing to himself)
                   I have a dress like that.


      ANGLE - CHANTEUSE

      Now with the crowd singing along, she pulls out all the
      stops. Her gestures and dance moves become more
      exaggerated, she's in the thrall of her audience.

                                 CHANTEUSE
                          (singing)
                   'Hangtown gals are lovely
                     creatures
                   Think they'll marry Mormon
                     preachers.'

      She sashays over to the French dignitary, pulls his
      monocle out of his eye and blows hot breath on it,
      steaming it up. As she pops it back on his face...

                                 CHANTEUSE
                          (singing)
                   'Heads thrown back to show their
                   features...'

      Now she puts her cheek next to Rita as if matching their
      relative beauty while picking the pocket of Lippenreider.

      Rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before Ebonia
      hands Coleman the keys to the cuffs. Coleman looks from
      the keys to Ebonia. He just caught on.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 99.

                                 COLEMAN
                   Go, Ebonia, go.

      Then Ebonia prances on stage to Gordon, cuddles up to
      him. Gordon looks at the big beautiful black woman with
      a mixture of amusement and relief. Of course, it's his
      "I'd rather be dead" partner, Jim West.

                                 WEST
                          (singing)
                   Ha... Ha... Hangtown girls...

                                 GORDON
                   Not to sound ungrateful, but you're
                   a little over the top.

                                  WEST
                          (sings)
                   Ha... Ha... Ha...

      West/Ebonia wraps the feather boa around Gordon's neck --
      hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand. Gordon looks
      worried. What's he going to do with a gun? As he tucks
      it up his sleeve...

                                 GORDON
                   Let me warn you about that
                   dress...

                                 WEST
                   Gotta go. Big finish...
                          (belts it out)
                   'Ha, ha, ha! Hangtown gals!!!'

      An immediate standing ovation. The diversion allows
      Coleman to unlock both Grant's and Rita's shackles.
      Grant looks at the keys.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                   Where'd those come from...?

                                 COLEMAN
                          (nods to Ebonia)
                   Captain West.

      Their eyes practically pop out of their heads.

                                 RITA
                   She's... no...!


      ANGLE - EBONIA/WEST

      Suddenly the tassels on his bosoms are spinning to the
      delight of the crowd.

                                 WEST
                          (suddenly blinks)
                   Wait a minute. What the hell
                   is this?

      He stops, but his tassels are still spinning on their
      own.


178   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK                      178

      Immediately two FLAME THROWERS EXPLODE from his cone-like
      bosoms.

      Maybe he should've listened about the dress. He turns to
      Gordon questioningly, and inadvertently incinerates one of
      Loveless's goons. He howls in pain, runs panicked...
      right into Rita.

                                 RITA
                   Serves you right for staring at
                   them.

      As she relieves the charred goon of his keys... Loveless
      turns to the rest of his goons.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Kill him!
                          (off their confused
                           looks, points)
                   Him! Him! The girl!

      Finally getting it, they rush Ebonia. Even his 4th of
      July breasts aren't a match for them. Desperate, West
      reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of
      Gordon's billiard balls. He depresses the number and
      rolls it at the guards.

                                 GORDON
                   Was that the eight ball?

                                 WEST
                   Mmm-hmm.

      Gordon grabs West and Rita, pulls them behind the bar.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                 GORDON
                   That one's an incendiary bomb.

      KA-BOOOOM! An EXPLOSION rips the place and a Santa Ana-
      sized fire starts immediately.

      Rita jumps up and makes her way through the smoke to a
      bearded SCIENTIST.

                                 WEST/GORDON
                   Rita!

      She unlocks his neck collar, turns to them and smiles.

                                 RITA
                          (disappearing into
                           the chaos)
                   Meet me after the show!

      Both West and Gordon look after her with yearning as
      three goons charge them. Coleman, amazed at their
      torpor, quickly grabs a RIFLE from the incinerated goon
      and OPENS FIRE. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

      Three goons drop. Gordon and West exchange looks.
      Not bad for an emphysemic old engineer.

                                 COLEMAN
                   Special Marshal... President
                   thought you needed some lookin'
                   after.

      Speaking of the President... he's grabbed a dead goon's
      RIFLE, and is LAYING DOWN a pretty good field of FIRE
      himself. Suddenly, he gets a tap on the shoulder from
      behind. It's Amazonia. Whap, she sends a right to his
      chin knocking him out. She throws him over her shoulder
      and carries him away.


179   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - BEHIND STAGE -            179
      DUSK

      As fire engulfs the place, Loveless has no choice but to
      retreat... for now. Surrounded by a cadre of his women,
      who carry the unconscious President Grant, Loveless heads
      through a round STEEL VAULT DOOR. As Amazonia swings the
      door closed, the foreign dignitaries BANG on the door
      begging for admittance.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                  FRENCH MINISTER

                    It's not the first time y'all have
                    been burned in America.

       He chuckles, nods to Amazonia, who SLAMS the DOOR closed.


180    EXT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - WEST, GORDON AND          180
       COLEMAN - DUSK

       emerge from the smoking lair, coughing and gasping for
       breath. They watch helplessly as...


181    EXT. AMPHITHEATER - TARANTULA - DUSK                            181

       CLAMBERS out of the bowl -- with Grant captive on the
       bridge.


A182   EXT. AMPHITHEATER - DUSK                                        A182

                                  COLEMAN
                    This is diabolical! They've got
                    the President and I've still got
                    that silly song in my head!

                                  GORDON
                           (freaking out)
                    C'mon we gotta go! We gotta ride
                    horse! Something!

       West is watching the Tarantula, turns to calm him.

                                   WEST
                    No, Arte.   Right now, we need
                    a plan.

       Gordon tries to compose himself.

                                  WEST
                    That flyin' machine idea of
                    yours... were you just acting like
                    you knew what you were talking
                    about... or could you build it?

184   EXT. NEAR SPIDER CANYON - WANDERER - STOPPED - DUSK             184

      PANNING an expanse of canvas comprising a 20-foot wing
      span. In the b.g., we hear Gordon SCRIBBLING.

                              GORDON (O.S.)
                Now Bernoulli's Principle states
                that the air flowing over a bird's
                wings... is moving at a lower
                pressure than the pressure below
                the wing... that's called 'lift.'
                Course, it's just a theory... it's
                never been tested.


      NEW ANGLE - GORDON'S DRAWING

      It depicts a wing cutting through the air. Arrows
      indicating airflow. Circular lines indicating "life."
      Only one problem, it's upside down. Gordon remedies
      that. Looks sheepishly to West who, like him, is wearing
      a leather flight jacket and goggles.

                              WEST
                You're not makin' me feel any
                better.

      Now they attach the wing to the frame -- which is
      connected to the Nitro-cycle.

      Coleman, his ever-present cigarette dangling from his
      mouth, readies bombs from the gunpowder of cartridges and
      Gordon's design. They look like Flash Gordon's
      spaceship. He passes them out.

                              COLEMAN
                Here's a coupla bon voyage
                presents.

                              GORDON
                Coleman! Must you smoke when
                handling explosives!

      Gordon grabs them away from him and sits in the saddle of
      the Nitro-cycle. West looks at Coleman apologetically as
      he stuffs the bombs into his jacket.

                              WEST
                He's just a little nervous 'cause
                no one's ever flown before.

      West is barely on the back when Gordon kicks it over and
      they BLAST OUT OF FRAME.

                                                              104.

185   EXT. DESERT AND CLIFF - NITRO-CYCLE - DUSK                     185

      builds ground speed. Gordon is nervous at the wheel.
      West gives him an encouraging pat.

                              WEST
                Avant...! Avant!!!

      But their speed is not enough to get them airborne.

                              GORDON
                We're not getting enough lift!
                We need more speed!

      Then in an uncharacteristic move by Gordon, he turns the
      machine around and heads for the cliff.

                              WEST
                Hey, uh... that's the cliff over
                there, you know?

      He guns the accelerator.

                              GORDON
                Yes, I do know.

      And with that, the Nitro-cycle goes off the cliff! It
      disappears for the count of five. Then suddenly it
      swoops up and PAST CAMERA. They're flying!


186   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP - IN FLIGHT - DUSK                      186

                              GORDON
                       (amazed)
                It worked...? It worked!!

                              WEST
                       (looking down)
                If you had to get one right, I'm
                real glad it was this one.

                              GORDON
                       (exhilarated, with
                        West-like abandon)
                Yeee-haaa!

      And with that, they bank the Desert Wasp around and fly
      off to save the Republic.


187   EXT. SILVERADO - TARANTULA - DUSK                              187

      is entering the town.

                                                               105.

188   EXT. BRIDGE - TARANTULA - DUSK                                  188

      Loveless turns to Grant, his face beaten and bruised.

                              LOVELESS
                Mr. President, I'll ask you once
                again. Sign the surrender or I
                decimate this town!

                              PRESIDENT GRANT
                You've had my answer.

      Loveless's face darkens as Amazonia hands him a tray of
      cotton balls.

                              LOVELESS
                       (as he puts in earplugs)
                I find the sound of people
                screaming while they get blown to
                smithereens, ruins the ear for
                music. Don't you?

      He offers them to the President.    Grant swats them away.

                              LOVELESS
                Commence firing!

      And with that the Tarantula OPENS FIRE on the town.
      There's a lot of stomping and smashing, too.


189   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - DUSK                       189

      high above the Tarantula. Gordon, lost in the joy of
      flight, turns to West who is more of a white-knuckler.

                              GORDON
                I think I'll call it...

                              WEST
                Lemme guess... an Elevation Enhancer?

                              GORDON
                       (why would you
                        call it that?)
                No, Air... Gordon.

      Now West points to the Tarantula and chaos below.

                              WEST
                Go down, down there!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               106.

189   CONTINUED:                                                      189

                                 GORDON
                          (as if to a child)
                   You can't just 'go down there.'
                   Flight depends on lift, which must
                   be calibrated to the angle of
                   descent...

                                 WEST
                   Shut up and go down there, will
                   ya?

      West reaches up, shoves the make-shift joystick forward.
      As the wasp plummets toward the bridge of the Tarantula
      and Gordon strains to keep control...


190   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  190

      Loveless and Grant are oblivious to our heroes above.    He
      unlocks one of Grant's handcuffs, presents him with a
      pen.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Well, Mr. President. Have you had
                   enough yet? Would you like to
                   sign the surrender or shall we set
                   a course for Denver? Wichita?
                   Washington, perhaps?

      Suddenly there's a LOUD WHOOOSH and...


191   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE SILVERADO -          191
      DUSK

      West and Gordon swooping down low. West unfastens
      BOMBS from his vest, waits for the right moment. As
      they swing past the Tarantula cannon, he drops them.
      BOOM! BOOM! The big gun falls limp.


192   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  192

      The dumbfounded Tarantula crew, which has been whittled
      down to Miss Lippenreider, Amazonia and Munitia. They
      never counted on having to shoot something in the air,
      and can't raise their weapons any higher than 90 degrees.


193   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE SILVERADO -          193
      DUSK

      West and Gordon banking around for another sortie.

                                                               107.

194   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  194

      Loveless wheels his chair amid the smoke and chaos,
      shocked. WARNING HORNS are GOING OFF.

                              PRESIDENT GRANT
                Well, I'll be damned... it's West
                and Gordon... flying!

      Grant chuckles at the dauntless pair's pluck.

                              PRESIDENT GRANT
                Keep that surrender handy. I
                think you're going to need it!

                              LOVELESS
                Don't be too sure...

      Loveless thinks for a moment, pushes Grant out of the
      way, and rolls over to the controls. He pushes a lever
      and the Tarantula bends down on its knees. He barks to
      Munitia.

                              LOVELESS
                I'm through with diplomacy... Take
                him away and kill him!


195   EXT. DESERT - TARANTULA - DUSK                                  195

196   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  196

      Now its rear end is tilted up in the air giving
      Amazonia at the Gatling gun a shot at...


197   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE SILVERADO -          197
      DUSK

      The BULLETS PERFORATE the Desert's Wasp's wings and BLAST
      through its STRUTS. They're going down!

                              WEST
                What does your boy da Vinci say
                about puttin' this bird down?

                              GORDON
                I don't think he thought it would
                ever work, so he didn't get that
                far. I'm open to suggestions.

                   Take out as many bad guys out as
                   you can.

      Gordon aims wasp at the Tarantula kamikaze-like just
      as...


198   EXT. TARANTULA - LOWER DECK - MUNITIA - DUSK                    198

      Munitia cocks back the hammer of her pistol and aims
      it at the President... The WASP CRASHES into her.
      The SHOT GOES OFF wildly and Munitia falls off the
      deck, to her death.

      As Grant and the wasp hang over the edge...


199   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  199

200   EXT. TARANTULA - LOWER DECK - DUSK                              200

      West and Gordon, bruised but alive, climb off the wasp
      and onto the lower deck. They pick up the President
      and dust him off.

                                 GORDON
                   Sorry about that, sir. Nose up,
                   flaps down. Have to remember that
                   next time.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                   Son, never apologize for saving a
                   President's life.

      As Gordon realizes that he's finally made amends for that
      night long ago in Ford's Theater...

                                 AMAZONIA (O.S.)
                   Soon you all can fly again. This
                   time with little angel wings.

      West, Gordon and Grant turn to see Amazonia and
      Lippenreider with the drop on them.

201   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  201

      West, Gordon, and Grant are now under Loveless's control.

                                LOVELESS
                  Gentlemen, I am truly impressed by
                  your effort and ingenuity. Why
                  not swear an oath of loyalty to
                  me... and forego your executions.

                                WEST
                  Why not? Well, I guess maybe I'd
                  rather see what happens when I
                  stuff your ass into that cannon
                  up there and fertilize the
                  landscape.

                                GORDON
                  Uh, Jim, I think a polite 'no'
                  would suffice...

      Loveless taps a button on his chair and the floor opens
      up beneath West. He goes crashing down a story.

      Loveless sics Amazonia on Gordon and Grant and proceeds
      down the ramp to the level below.

                                LOVELESS
                  Lippenreider, take over the
                  controls.
                         (looks down at West)
                  We may not have a woodshed on
                  board, but that boy is gonna get a
                  whoopin' anyway!


202   INT. BELLY OF THE BEAST - DAY                                   202

      West plunges down into the metal chamber. Oiled pistons,
      thrusting. Steam, billowing. Struggles to his feet.

      There, out of the shadows, steps...

      KNIFE GUY

      He's a mess... no hands, just brass collars where they
      used to be. They lock eyes.

                                WEST
                  So, I guess you're the one who's
                  gonna give me my whoopin'.

      They square off. A beat. Then, a long steely blade
      shoots out from where his left hand used to be.

                                  WEST
                   Pfft.   I got one a' those.

      West reveals the less impressive four inch stiletto in
      his boot. Knife Guy responds by producing another
      blade from his other cuff.

                                 WEST
                   But you've got two of those.
                          (beat)
                   Okay, lemme talk to Gordon, I'll
                   see if he can...

      No time for talk. Knife Guy does a bad-ass series of
      moves. The blades criss-crossing one another at blinding
      speed. West, unimpressed, retorts with a lame shake of
      his stiletto and boot.

      And the fight begins...

      Knife Guy attacks! West narrowly escapes each thrust of
      the knife, and attempts a kick to the groin... but comes
      up short -- The stiletto collides with one of the blades
      and snaps like a carrot. His only weapon... gone.

                                  WEST
                   Damn.

      West rolls onto the railing to avoid the attack. Sparks
      fly as the Knife Guy tries to slice and dice West but
      misses each time, hitting the metal railing instead.

      West rolls to the floor, sucking air. Knife Guy lands
      a kick to West's ribs. And to make matters worse...

      WRENCH GUY

      just showed up. He swings his wrench at West's head.
      West ducks but gets kicked in the back. He sails across
      the room, lands flat on his back. Now...

      SHOVEL GUY

      makes an appearance. He hammers his shovel at West's
      groin, over and over. (West is in a crab position and
      backs up to avoid this.) West finally gets a kick in
      -- it does a moderate amount of damage.

      Wrench Guy appears and swings his huge wrench at West's
      head. West escapes it, barely...

      Knife Guy thrusts a side-kick at West's chest, but West
      catches his foot, holds on for dear life.

      Wrench Guy is inbound, with wrench in hand. He swings
      on West, but West blocks it with Knife Guy's leg... OUCH!
      West punches both of them. Wrench Guy tumbles OUT OF
      FRAME.

      West stands. Looking for a way out, but... no luck...
      Shovel Guy attacks. West ducks and the shovel connects
      squarely with Knife Guy's blades. West crouches and
      throws two simultaneous punches, each connecting with a
      set of jewels.

      West stands, follows it up with a right cross and left
      hook and these two jokers wind up OUT OF FRAME.

      Now... the Wrench Guy is on his feet and he's pissed!
      He attacks West, lands a solid kick to the chest and
      West flies backward toward a...


      HANGING CHAIN

      which he grabs. He scales the gears, gets a solid grip,
      then swings, a huge arc across the room, gaining momentum,
      and kicks Shovel Guy and Wrench Guy at the same time! Off
      their feet they go, slamming onto the metal floor.

      West lands. Knife Guy attacks. West uses the chain to
      block the blades which are flying at him, left and right.
      Sparks fly. West manages to wrap the chain around one of
      the knives, locks it down, and heaves it into the gears...
      the blade snaps.

                                 WEST
                   No more Mister Knife guy!

      West drops a stiff right-cross on the chin of the Knife
      Guy... wobbles his legs a bit. But before West can follow
      up...

      ANOTHER BLADE SHOOTS OUT

      to replace the broken one.    It stops about a half-an-inch
      from West's nose.

      A struggle ensues, but West manages to wrap the chain
      around Knife Guy's neck and string him up.

      West throws a kick to his back... Knife Guy, hanging by
      his neck, flies through the belly... (the chain is on a
      track)... and out of the mouth of the beast, down into
      the abyss, chain and all.

      Shovel Guy springs to his feet and swings on West. West
      grabs the shovel and they struggle for possession...

      Wrench Guy comes out of nowhere and wants a piece of the
      action. But West uses the shovel to deflect the swing-
      ing wrench... sparks fly.

      West gains sole possession of the shovel and mule-kicks
      Shovel Guy OUT OF FRAME. West spins just in time to
      land a crippling blow to Wrench Guy's back.

      Shovel Guy grabs the shovel. He and West tug-o'-war again.
      West ducks under the shovel and moves back-to-front with
      him. West elbows him in the ribs. He responds by putting
      West in a choke hold. West swings the shovel wildly but
      hits his target -- shovel Guy's head!

      West steps back, gets his footing and, for good measure,
      whacks him in the back.

      Wrench Guy attacks. West defends himself with the shovel
      and lands a stiff kick to his stomach. Wrench Guy goes
      down...

      West turns, hits Shovel Guy in the chest with the shovel
      and he goes down...

      Wrench Guy sneaks up on West from behind and swings at
      his head. West, on instinct, lifts the shovel and blocks
      the deadly blow at the last second.

      West has now found his rhythm...

      He swings and shovel and connects with... first, the
      foot, then the chin, and last but not least, the head --
      BOINK! West drops the shovel and, World Wrestling
      Federation style, picks him up and hurls him into the
      space between the gears. We won't see him anymore!

      West pivots and WHACK!... Shovel Guy plants a neat
      little roundhouse kick squarely on West's jaw. West
      backs up and catches another in the stomach. Then...

      Shovel Guy really shows what he's made of...

      He does a series of jump-kicks, round-houses and fan-
      kicks into the air. All perfectly timed, all deadly.

                                 SHOVEL GUY
                   I learned that from a Chinaman.

      West, without missing a beat, steps on the shovel, which
      flips into his hand and -- WHACK! -- lands a clean one
      right on the top of Shovel Guy's melon.

                                 WEST
                   I just made that up.

      Shovel Guy reels back and tumbles over the railing,
      through the hole and he's gone...

                                 WEST
                   Don't forget your shovel!

      West casts the shovel out into the abyss.

                                 WEST
                          (upward)
                   Is that all you got for me,
                   Loveless?!

      West, exhausted, turns and sees...

      METAL HEAD

      all seven feet of him. The top of his head is a metal
      plate. Extending downward, encircling his eyes. West
      soaks him in, sighs.

                                 WEST
                   Uh, I just threw my shovel out.
                   So this really isn't fair. If
                   you don't mind, I'd like to...

      West, at lightning speed, throws a sucker-punch/spin-
      ning back-fist to Metal Head's jaw... PING! That one
      really hurt... West's hand, that is. Metal Head isn't
      fazed a bit. West throws another shot, this time to
      the gut... PING! Then a kick to the groin... PING!!!

                                   WEST
                            (incredulous)
                   Noooo.

      Metal Head has had enough. He effortlessly picks West
      up by his lapels and flings him across the room. West
      tumbles, and lands right next to...

      WRENCH

      He picks it up and starts swinging! A shot to the body
      ... PING! Then another... PING! Then another... PINGGGG!
      Metal Head lurches forward, absorbing each blow with not
      so much as a twitch of the eye. West furries... PING!
      PING! PING! PING!... nothing! He goes for the head...
      PINNNNNNGGGG!... nothing! West is out of time. He's been
      backed up as far as he can go. His heels are dangling
      over the mouth of the beast, a thousand feet above the
      rocky cliff.

                                   WEST
                   Sorry.

       Metal head grunts, grimaces and pitches forward, toward
       West, slowly but menacingly... West braces himself.

                                  METAL HEAD
                    Urrrrrrrrrrggggghhh!!!

       West side-steps and Metal Head falls face first into
       the open air.

                                   WEST
                            (downward)
                    You guys just don't get out
                    enough.

                                                     CUT TO:


202A   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                              202A

       West slowly gets up. Loveless is about to roll over
       him. He jumps up in the air, grabs onto an overhead
       strut, reverses and shoves the wheelchair off the ramp
       jamming the wheels.

       A smile comes to West's face as he watches Loveless's
       frustrated attempts at going forward and backward.

                                  WEST
                    When you get right down to it,
                    Loveless, you just can't beat
                    a good pair of legs.

                                  LOVELESS
                           (thin smile)
                    You're obviously not a poker
                    player, Mr. West...

       Loveless presses a button, the sound of MECHANICAL GEARS
       ENGAGING. Suddenly four metal legs appear from underneath
       the wheelchair, raising his body to a height of six foot ten.

                                  LOVELESS
                    Two pair always beats a pair.

       West stares up at him slack-jawed. Loveless rolls up his
       sleeves, steps away from the wheelchair ready to fight.

                                  LOVELESS
                    Now... Was it someone particularly
                    close to you who perished in that
                    military action?

       West responds with a roundhouse kick to the chin that
       makes Loveless spin around on the platform of his chair.

                    Hmmm.   Well, that hit a nerve.

       Loveless imitates West by kicking with a lightning flash
       of an alloy leg. It's a rib cracker that sends West
       sprawling.

                                  LOVELESS
                    A mother, perhaps? A father?


       CLOSE - WEST'S HAND

       He's just trying to get up when a cleated metal foot
       stomps down with hundreds of foot pounds per square inch.
       As West screams in pain...


203    EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                203

       Gordon tries to come to West's aid, but Amazonia points
       a gun barrel at his temple. Gordon can only watch
       helplessly as...


204    INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                            204

       Loveless begins a metallic-flamenco, hands on his hips,
       his piston-like legs kicking West's body and head.

                                  LOVELESS
                    It feels so good to stretch my
                    legs.

      West can't take much more of this, he's about to pass
      out. Loveless lowers his alloy foot over West's head and
      begins to crush it like a grape.

                                 LOVELESS
                   I likes to beat my feet on the

      Gordon watches in a tortured sweat as his partner tries
      to hold off the metal foot. But he's slowly losing.
      Gordon turns to his female captors, throws his arms out
      beseechingly. When he does, the derringer comes snapping
      out of his sleeve in the device which normally holds his
      pen.

                                 GORDON
                   Stop this violence!

      Gordon blinks at the gun. So do Lippenreider and
      Amazonia. Grant knows what to say, if Gordon doesn't.

                                   PRESIDENT GRANT
                   Drop 'em.

      They obey, chucking their guns overboard.


206   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                              206

      West's eyes are popping out of his head, the mechanical
      pressure of Loveless's leg.

                                 GORDON (O.S.)
                   Stop or I'll shoot!

      If possible, West's eyes pop even further.     Gordon shoot?


      NEW ANGLE - LOVELESS

      looks up to see Gordon holding the derringer on him from
      up above.

                                 LOVELESS
                   You expect to kill me with that
                   little pea shooter?

                                   GORDON
                   If I have to.    Yes.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Why is it, that I'm unafraid?
                          (chuckles)
                   I believe you gentlemen are the
                   polar opposites of a moral
                   dilemma and I'm stuck in the
                   middle. On one end, we have
                   Mr. West, a man of primitive
                   vigours uncomplicated by
                   intellect. And on the other,
                   there's Mr. Gordon. A man of
                   ideas, but unlike myself, lacks
                   the passion to kill for them.
                   He'd like to be able to act his
                   way out of it. And for some
                   reason when he's actin', someone
                   always seems to get killed.

      Loveless puts more pressure on West's head, he groans.
      Gordon aims.

                                  WEST
                          (gasps)
                   Shoot him, Gordon...!

                                 LOVELESS
                   I'm right about you, aren't I,
                   Gordon? And that's why I'm
                   gonna kill your friend here.
                   Then I'm going to kill you.

      POP! The SHOT startles Loveless, West and even Gordon.
      But when Loveless realizes that he's not hit, he laughs.

                                 LOVELESS
                   After all that, you missed.

                                  GORDON
                   Not exactly.

      He gestures down Loveless's legs to a punctured metal
      tube that's spraying a stream of hydraulic fluid all over
      the deck -- rendering the foot on West's head, powerless.
      West gets out from under, rubs his neck to regain
      circulation.

                                 WEST
                   Better than a fountain pen, don't
                   you think.
                          (nods behind Gordon)
                   By the way, your chivalry's about
                   to be tested.

      Gordon turns to see...

      ANGLE - AMAZONIA AND LIPPENREIDER

      Charging him. They smash into him, driving him to the
      rail. As they pummel him, trying to throw him over,
      Gordon realizes this is no time for passivity. He
      retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would
      make West proud. Over the rail, goes Lippenreider. In
      that split-second before she drops, Gordon mouths
      "bye-bye."

      Before he can savor the moment further, Amazonia clubs
      him from behind. Gordon whirls and hits her so hard it
      surprises them both. Over the railing she goes! As
      Amazonia hovers there, President Grant gives her the
      kick in the pants she needs to go sailing.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                          (to Gordon, impressed)
                   We'll be joining them in a moment
                   if you can't stop that thing!


207   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  207

      Gordon turns to see Grant gesturing at the horizon. His
      eyes widen when he sees the flat mesa they are travelling
      comes to a sudden halt at a 1000 foot cliff.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                   Let's see how clever you really
                   are...

      Gordon frantically starts pulling this lever and that.
      Meanwhile...

209   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                              209

      West approaches Loveless.    There's going to be some
      payback.

                                 WEST
                   For almost four long years I've
                   been trackin' the animal
                   responsible for the Massacre at
                   New Liberty. And I hear that's you...

      But with the hydraulic fluid, the fight has gone out of
      Loveless. His mechanical legs shrivel before our eyes,
      and Loveless sinks helplessly to the deck like the
      Wicked Witch.

      Whimpering pathetically, he uncouples his body from the
      useless contraption and slowly backs up to his wheelchair
      that's stuck against the railing.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Please, West... show a little mercy
                   to a poor defenseless cripple...

                                 WEST
                          (imitating his accent)
                   Now, now, Doctor... let's not cloud
                   this otherwise sunny day with that
                   poor-ol'-me-cripple-talk. Just
                   buck up and say to yourself, 'I am
                   indefatigably hard-pumpin' and
                   steely!'

      Loveless gets to his wheelchair and collapses in it.

                                 LOVELESS
                   After I kill ya, I swear I'm gonna
                   boil you down to axle grease!

                                 WEST
                   Now that's the ol' doctor I know!

      But the smile fades from West's face when he sees Loveless's
      shotgun armrests pop out leveled at his waist.

      West has nowhere to go but up as he leaps to grab the
      I-beam over his head just as Loveless pulls the triggers
      on both BARRELS... BOOM! BOOM!

      The SHOTS almost blow the heels off West's boots. They
      PUNCTURE a PIPE behind him. Steam spews out. This is
      going to have an effect on something.


210   EXT. TARANTULA BRIDGE - DUSK                                   210

      Gordon and Grant are trying different combinations to
      stop the thing. Finally, Gordon throws up his hands.
      He doesn't know what else to try when suddenly the
      Tarantula seizes up as if it just had a heart attack
      and tilts forward.


211   EXT. CLIFF - EDGE - DUSK                                       211

      The Tarantula lurches forward drastically and teeter-
      totters on the brink.

      WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                             114A.

212   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                             212

      The sudden stopping jerks Loveless' wheelchair free.
      Despite his frantic efforts, he's rolling toward the
      opposite railing. When the wheelchair hits a pool of
      hydraulic fluid on the deck, it spins him around 180
      degrees.

      West jumps up, grabs a girder. The wheelchair spins
      under West's legs and then -- CLANK -- it slams into
      the railing and wedges there.


213   EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DUSK                                         213

      The impact makes the mighty beast jerk forward, inches
      away from toppling over.


214   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                             214

      The jolt shoots West off the girder. He free-falls
      through the belly and out into the open air. Thinking
      quickly, he grabs onto the back of Loveless' wheel-
      chair. His arms nearly torn from their sockets. His
      weight causes the wheelchair to shift, now leaving it
      hanging on by a thread. West reaches out, grabs the
      wheel of the chair and hangs there.

                              LOVELESS
                Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
                How did we arrive in this dark
                situation?

                                WEST
                I don't know.    Guess I'm stumped!

                              LOVELESS
                And I'm so cotton-pickin' afraid
                of heights. They just give me the
                spooks!

                              WEST
                Ah, don't be afraid, Loveless.
                With this being the last leg of
                our journey and all, you should
                soak in the view, you're really
                missing something.

                              LOVELESS
                Mister West, I'm gonna cut this
                conversation short...

                              WEST
                Good one, Loveless.   I didn't think
                of that one.

                   Mister West!!! I am faced with a
                   difficult decision here. On one
                   hand, there is the overwhelming
                   love that I have for myself, and
                   on the other, the raw, seething
                   hatred I have for you! Now, I
                   could kill you very easily, just
                   by pulling this lever...

      He moves the joystick.    The chair jerks back.

                                 LOVELESS
                   But, of course, I would die along
                   with you. I guess the only thing
                   that I can take comfort in is the
                   hope that you would hit those
                   rocks a second before me and I
                   could enjoy immeasurable bliss

                   Allow me to make that decision
                   easy on you, Loveless. Because
                   I want to see you dead a hell of
                   a lot more than I want to live.

                                 LOVELESS
                   Why is it that I have a sneaking
                   suspicion, that although you are
                   as black as the night on the
                   outside... inside, you are yellow?!

      They lock eyes.    A beat.

      Grant scans the crowd, every race seems present at this

                                 GORDON
                   Uh, just out of curiosity, sir...
                   who's Agent No. 1?

      Grant just shakes his head, some things never change.

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                   I don't think that matters very
                   much, do you? Gordon? Besides,
                   you'll have plenty of time to
                   discuss it on your new assignment.
                          (hands them piece
                           of paper)
                   See you back in Washington.

      He snaps off a salute, starts to go as they read it.
      Gordon looks up, very troubled.

                                 GORDON
                   But, sir... what about our train?

                                 PRESIDENT GRANT
                          (over shoulder)
                   Well, I'm taking it of course.
                   Hell, you let Loveless blow up
                   mine.

      As they look at one another in dismay...

                                 RITA (O.S.)
                   Jim... Arte...?

      They turn to see Rita approaching them from a crowd of
      scientists. She's looking extraordinarily fetching
      in a print dress and parasol.

      West and Gordon sit up like dogs.

                                  WEST
                   Rita!   You look great.

                                 GORDON
                   Ravishing, a vision.

      She hugs West, she hugs Gordon.        Who's it gonna be?

                                 RITA
                   I just wanted to thank you for
                   everything you've done for me...
                   before I went back home to Texas.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                                117.

                                 WEST
                   Texas? Why're you going back
                   there? Why don't you come with me
                   back to Washington?

                                 GORDON
                   Or better still, come with me to
                   Washington. I could introduce you
                   to people I still know in the
                   theater...

                                 WEST
                   She's not really an entertainer,
                   remember?

                                 RITA
                          (intercedes)
                   I can't go with either of you.

      She looks from one crestfallen suitor to the other.

                                 RITA
                   It's not that you both don't have
                   your attributes.
                          (to Gordon)
                   You're so sophisticated and such a
                   wonderful cook.
                          (to West)
                   Jim, you're good with a gun... and
                   have great legs.
                          (to both)
                   And you're both so brave. But...
                   I'm afraid I haven't been
                   completely honest with you.

                                 WEST AND GORDON
                   Uh-oh...

                                 RITA
                   Professor Escobar's not my father.
                   He's my husband.

      She gestures to a handsome goateed Latino waiting for
      her. Shaved and cleaned up, he's not the old man we
      thought.

                                 WEST
                   Rita... why didn't you just tell
                   us that in the first place?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                   118.

216   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                   216

                                 RITA
                   Well, I was going to... but would
                   you have really brought me along
                   if I said I was married?
                   Honestly.

      Neither West nor Gordon knows what to say.

                                 RITA
                   I didn't think so.

      She turns and starts to walk away.       Stops and smiles.

                                 RITA
                   At least you still have each
                   other.

      As West and Gordon look at one another...


217   EXT. MONUMENT VALLEY - SUNSET                                       217

      We gaze out over one of those achingly beautiful John
      Ford vistas as we hear our heroes voices.

                                 WEST (O.S.)
                   You know, Arte...

                                 GORDON (O.S.)
                   What's that, Jim?

                                 WEST (O.S.)
                   Maybe Rita's right...

      Suddenly intruding into the f.g. is a huge metal leg.
      Then another LEG CLOMPS down... and the Tarantula comes
      INTO FULL VIEW. As our heroes ride slowly into the
      sunset.

                                 WEST
                   Besides... there's a lot of
                   other women in the world.

                                 GORDON
                   That's easy for you to say. She
                   didn't walk off with your best
                   dress.


                                                         FADE OUT.

                          Act I

FADE IN:

EXT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

Under gloomy sky a huge fortress looms on a volcanic
mountainside.  From within WE HEAR the agonizing scream
of a woman giving birth.

INT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

The scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri-
dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a
dungeon.

INT.. DUNGEON - DAY

Silhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand
guard.  In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch
from behind iron bars.  The screaming stops.  There's a
moment of silence.  As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell
WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY.

In the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as
ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the
baby in swaddling.

                         DRUID
          Is it a girl?

                         ETHNA
          It is a girl.

                         DRUID
          Show me its arm.

Ethna peels back the swaddling.  On the baby's arm is a
small marking.

                         DRUID
          It's true then.  I must tell Queen
          Bavmorda.

With great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon
stairs.  Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's
breast.  The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it
stops crying.  Then she reaches out and clasps the
midwife's wrist.

                        MOTHER
          Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're
          going to kill my baby.

Ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes
her head at the mother.

                         ETHNA
          They'll kill you.

                        MOTHER
          Please save my baby.

Ethna hesitates.  Then decides.  She quickly wraps to-
gether some rags and gives them to the mother.

                         ETHNA
          Pretend this is the child.

                        MOTHER
          Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you.

The mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who
hides the baby inside the basket of rags.  Ethna car-
ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs.

The mother lies back and sighs with relief.  Then she
hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear.

QUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her
black robes flowing behind her.  The druid hurries
alongside.

                       BAVMORDA
          We will start the ritual at dusk.
          You're certain this is the one?

                         DRUID
          It bears the markings.

                       BAVMORDA
          I must see for myself!  Just as the
          omen foretold!

The guards fearfully move aside as Bavmorda enters the
cell.

                       BAVMORDA
          So.  You *were* the one.

                        MOTHER
          Yes.  But nothing you can do will
          stop the prophecy.

                       BAVMORDA
          This child will have no power over
          me....

Bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi-
ously tears them apart.

                       BAVMORDA
                      (furiously)
          Where's the baby!

One of the guards looks up the stairs.

                         GUARD
          The midwife!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.

                       BAVMORDA
          Find that baby!  Use the dogs!
          Sorsha!

Two guards draw swords and charge upstairs.  Bavmorda
grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kill her.

Bavmorda storms away with the druid.  WE SEE the shadow
of the guard move over the terrified mother.  War drums
begin to beat out an alarm.

EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

TITLES BEGIN.  The midwife hurries through swirling
show, clutching the baby.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate
village, driving ferocious DEATH DOGS into huts,
violently searching for the baby.  The oppressed, poor
VILLAGERS are yanked into the street.  Some of them are
beaten.  One is killed.

The midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby,
then runs away from the village.

EXT. GRASSLAND - DAY

Ethna treks across an open grass field.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

She huddles by a fire, exhausted and hungry, her
clothes filthy and torn, and she rocks the crying baby.
She hears dogs howling in the distance.  She clutches
the baby, kicks out the fire, and runs.

EXT. OCEAN CLIFFSIDE - DAY

She scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline.

EXT. FOREST - DAWN

Ethna runs desperately for her life.  Chasing her are
two vicious DEATH DOGS.  She scrambles across a shallow
river.  She claws at rock and tears away sticks and
driftwood matted together with weeds.  Into this she
places the baby and sets it afloat downstream.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!

The dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the
river.  The midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur-
ing the dogs.  As they attack her:

                        MIDWIFE
          I don't have her!  No!  No!

She grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash-
ing at the snarling dogs.

From the baby's view, as it floats down the river, WE
SEE the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees.

EXT. DOWNRIVER - DAY - MONTAGE

The little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the
current.  It glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over
rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

At last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping
the baby.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS

Suddenly WE HEAR rustling leaves, possibly another
Death Dog.  Then WE HEAR giggling.  Two children, RANON
and MIMS, watch in amazement from the riverbank.

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Holding onto a plow, WILLOW UFGOOD struggles behind a
huge hog.  From a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he
tosses seeds.

                         RANON
          Dada!  We found something in the
          river!

Willow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to-
ward him.  They grab his sleeves and tug him away from
his plow.

                        WILLOW
          I can't run off and play with you
          now.  I've got work to do.

                      RANON/MIMS
          But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry!

Willow drops his sack of seeds.  The ugly hog glares at
him like a guilty conscience.  The children squeal with
excitement as their father runs toward the river with
them.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

WE SEE Willow from the baby's view.  His eyes pop open.
He quickly backs his children away.

                        WILLOW
          Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't
          know where it's been.  It could be
          diseased.

                         MIMS
          It's a baby!

                         RANON
          It's not a Nelwyn baby.

                        WILLOW
          No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn
          baby.  It looks like a daikini...

                         MIMS
          Ooh, it's so cute...

                        WILLOW
          Mims!  Get back here!  It might
          bite you.

Willow drags Mims away.  Then the baby starts crying.

                         RANON
          Can't we keep it, Dada?

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely not.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!

Willow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis-
tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft,
plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying
baby.

                        WILLOW
          Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect --
          that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon,
          keep this thing hidden...

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Burglekutt's beady eyes spot Willow making a mad dash
for his plow.  Swinging his fat stomach, he angrily
points his walking stick and goes after him.

                         KIAYA
          Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done
          anything wrong!

Willow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field,
her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow
quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all
day.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  What do you think you're
                doing!  I tell the planting seeds
                in this village.

                         KIAYA
          I told him we didn't steal it, Wil-
          low.

Burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of
Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          You haven't paid your debts.  Where
          did you get these seeds?

With pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife.

                        WILLOW
          In the forest.  My family's been
          gathering them since last fall.
          There's no law against that, Bur-
          glekutt.

Suddenly the children laugh in the distance.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!  You left the children
          alone by the river??

In alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur-
glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get
          your planting done before the rains
          start.  You're gonna lose this
          land.

He raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes
them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward
two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya
SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks
and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's
crazy."  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits.
Then runs as fast as he can to the river.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Kiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up,
and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his
hips.

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely, under no condition, is
          anyone in this family going to fall
          in love with that baby.

They all fall in love as he speaks.  The children fol-
low Kiaya up on the bank, walking right past Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby.
          Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be
          ignored!

Ignored, Willow huffs after them across his unplowed
field.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood
tub and the children entertain the naked baby with
sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a
magic trick.

                        WILLOW
          This is bad.  If we're caught with
          that little daikini it'll be the
          end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need
          that for the festival.
                (indicates magic cloth)
          Kiaya, what are we going to do?

                         KIAYA
          We're gonna give this baby a bath.

The baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the
bath.

                        WILLOW
          Burglekutt's right.  There's not
          enough time to finish plowing.
          We'll lose everything and I'll end
          up working in the mines.

He shudders at the thought.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, do you think we should take
          her to the Village Council?

                        WILLOW
          No, no!  They'll think it's a bad
          omen.  There'll be a flood or a
          drought or a plague and
          everybody'll blame me for it!

                         RANON
          Look.  What's that?

Willow leans forward.  On the baby's shoulder is a
small branded scar in a circular design.  It only adds
to Willow's fears.

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.  This is trouble.
          I'll talk to the High Aldwin about
          it tomorrow at the Festival.

The baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

The raucous BAND plays as NELWYNS dance and celebrate
amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers.  A
crowd cheers wildly as MINERS battle FARMERS in a tug-
of-war, finally yanking the farmers face-first into a
puddle of mud.  On a stage a HARLEQUIN dances delight-
fully.  While on a raised platform the five members of
the VILLAGE COUNCIL sit and observe, mildly amused.
The head councilman is Burglekutt.

The WE SEE Willow on another stage.  He flourishes his
colorful sticks and cloths.  In the audience WE NOTICE
his friend MEEGOSH, who wears a miner's apron, rooting
Willow on.

                        WILLOW
          And now!  For our final amazing bit
          of magic, I will make an entire pig
          completely disappear!

Meegosh applauds as Mims and Ranon trot out lugging a
tiny baby pig in a crate.  As Willow takes the pig out
it bites his hand and gets away.  Willow tackles and
squashes it.  The crowd laughs and half of them leave,
and Meegosh covers his face.

Mims and Ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket.  Willow
cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his
back and suddenly it's gone!  Impresse, the crowd
gasps.  Then the pig squeals and dashes through
Willow's legs and leaps off the stage.

                         CROWD
          Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!

Burglekutt and the Council shake their heads as Willow,
embarassed, picks up his things.  Meegosh trots up
with the pig under his arm.

                        WILLOW
          Meegosh, I'm in trouble.

                        MEEGOSH
          Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need
          a better pig, that's all.

But as they walk past the Village Council, and Bur-
glekutt sneers down at Willow, Meegosh catches on.

                        MEEGOSH
          Now Burglekutt's got you in the
          squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in
          the mines like me.

                        WILLOW
          Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces.
          That's the last thing I'd ever do.
                     (he shudders)
          I gotta get my crop planted.

                        MEEGOSH
          You know I'll help you as much as I
          can, Willow.

The Village Council members stand up respectfully as
the wise old HIGH ALDWIN hobbles through the adoring
crowd.  Mims and Ranon rush up to Willow with several
other children who are eating candy.

                         MIMS
          Dada, can we get treacle candy?
          Can we, can we?  Please?

                        WILLOW
                     (preoccupied)
          Meegosh, can you watch the chil-
          dren?  I gotta talk to the High
          Aldwin.

                        MEEGOSH
                    (truly amazed)
          The High Aldwin??  Why?

But Willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving
Meegosh with a dozen sugar-charged children and a pig.

Willow desperately pushes past people and finally
reaches the High Aldwin.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  I have to talk to you.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Not today, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          It's a matter of great importance
          to me!

Burglekutt stares angrily from his platform.  Slightly
annoyed, the High Aldwin stops and places his hand on
Willow's shoulder.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I
          know you're eager to be my appren-
          tice, Willow.  But today is the
          spring festival.

Suddenly a walking stick is pointed at Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!!
          Willow Ufgood???

His belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging
his councilmen to join in.  Willow shrinks away, em-
barassed.

Then a terrified SHRIEK shatters the festivity.  Music 
stops and people grab their children and run for their
lives.  A DEATH DOG rips a trail of destruction through
the village.

Meegosh holds onto Ranon and Mims.  But when Mims sees
Willow she runs right out into the open.  Willow
charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from
the beast's claws.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!  Bordak!

A loud war cry distracts the dog.  VOHNKAR, the
toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army
of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks.  Wil-
low and Meegosh grab sticks.  The Nelwyns battle the
Death Dog.  At last, Vohnkar drives a spear through its
chest and it dies hideously.

                        MEEGOSH
          What was it looking for?

                      A VILLAGER
          It said "bordak"!  What does it
          mean?

                      COUNCILMAN
                      (scholarly)
          Baby!  It means baby!  It was look-
          ing for somebody's baby!

Mothers grab their children, people look around the
wrecked village in terror.  There's a haunting silence.

                         MIMS
          Mommy?

Suddenly alarmed, Willow races towrd his distant farm,
his children hurrying behind.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  Kiaya!

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow bursts in and finds Kiaya calmly feeding the
baby.  Relieved, he throws his arms around her.

                        WILLOW
          We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We
          must take her to the Council.

The children run in and they all huddle together, cher-
ishing their precious lives.

INT. COUNCIL BUILDING - DAY

Arguing villagers pack the church-shaped room to the
open door at the back and into the balconies above.
The councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the
High Aldwin seated in a special chair above them.  Tak-
ing charge, Burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with
his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          An evil beast from the outer world
          has invaded our peaceful village,
          looking for a baby!

This only adds to the frenzy.

                      A VILLAGER
          It's a sign!  An omen!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Our crops will die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Silence!  One beast we can kill.
          But there may be more!  And they
          won't give up their search till
          they've found what they're looking
          for!

                        MEEGOSH
          Whose baby is it!

                    OTHER VILLAGERS
          Who's to blame for this!

Amid the chaos the High Aldwin slowly stands up.  As if
he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the
back.

At the back door, holding the baby, Willow tries to
push his way through the jostling crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hand.  It flashes magically.  He
points as he speaks:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Willow Ufgood!  Come before me!

The crowd stands apart as Willow walks the length of
the room.  Kiaya and the children follow part way and
then stand aside next to Meegosh.  Burglekutt simmers
as Willow approaches the platform.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Earlier today you tried to tell me
          something, Willow.

                        WILLOW
                    (bows his head)
          My family found this baby in the
          river, High Aldwin.

The crowd stirs but the High Aldwin silences them with
a simple gesture.  He gazes down at the baby mysteri-
ously.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          A daikini child...
                   (his eyes close)
           ...of some importance, I feel...

                      BURGLEKUTT
          That's what the beasts want!  Give
          it back!

The crowd rumbles, many agree.

                        WILLOW
          They'll kill her!  We can't let
          this baby die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          What do we care!

Burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him.
Almost in a trance:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
           ...importance...yes...this child
          is special...

                      COUNCILMAN
          What should we do?

Instantly, the High Aldwin drops his arms and opens his
eyes.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          This child must be taken beyond the
          boundaries of our village.  All the
          way to the daikini crossroads.

The room goes silent.

                      A VILLAGER
          Who will do that?

                   SEVERAL VILLAGERS
          Vohnkar!  Vohnkar!

Vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and
pounds his chest once with his fist.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The outer world is dangerous and
          corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is
          hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are
          you willing to sacrifice your life?

Brave Vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful-
ly.

                        VOHNKAR
          If I go, who'll defend you if other 
          beasts attack?

The crowd rumbles and shouts, and Vohnkar mops his brow
and scuttles away from the platform.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          He's right!  It seems only fair
          that the man to take this baby to
          the crossroads...
                  (walking stick up)
           ...be the very man who plucked
          it...
                 (walking stick down)
           ...out of the river!

All eyes turn to Willow.  Kiaya gasps and Meegosh holds
her back.

                        WILLOW
          I can't do it!  I haven't put my
          crop in!

                     A COUNCILMAN
          You caused this trouble.  You found
          the baby...you get rid of it!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          I nominate Willow Ufgood!

The crowd cheers wildly.  The High Aldwin steps forward
to the edge of the platform.  With a flourish he waves
his arms.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          I will consult the bones!

Something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands.  The
crowd jumps away.  The High Aldwin scatters small bones
across the floor below him.  He leans down and studies
the bones.  Willow looks at Kiaya, who is worried and
afraid.  The High Aldwin speaks softly to him:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones tell me nothing.
                   (he eyes Willow)
          But I must make a decision.  Is
          there love in your heart for this
          child?

Willow hesitates.  He looks at the baby.

                        WILLOW
          Yes.

The High Aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones have spoken!  Willow?
          The security of this village
          depends on you!

The people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to
leave.  Kiaya and Meegosh and the children push their
way toward Willow, who stands there staring at the
baby.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

Kiaya's hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid.
Near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack.
On the other side of the fire, Willow diapers the baby.
The house is quiet.

                         MIMS
          Dada?

Willow sets the baby down.  He goes around an opne wall
an sits on his daughter's bed, straightening her blank-
ets and toys.

                         MIMS
          Watch out for brownies, Dada.

                        WILLOW
          I will, Mims.  Goodnight.

He smiles and kisses her.  Then crosses over to Ranon's bed.

                         RANON
          Dada, what's a daikini?

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis are giant people who live
          far far away.

                         RANON
          Are you scared?

Willow shrugs.  Ranon sits up in bed.

                         RANON
          I could be you rguard!  I could
          carry your spear!

                        WILLOW
                       (smiles)
          What a great son you are, Ranon.  I
          wish I could take you with me.  Now
          go to sleep...

Ranon slides down under his blankets.  Willow kisses
him, looks at him a moment, then quietly withdraws to-
ward the fire.

EXT. SACRED HILL - SUNRISE

The silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on
top.

Carrying the baby, Willow climbs the hill with his fami-
ly.  He wears a papoose rig, supply pack, and a dagger.
He hands the baby to Kiaya, then walks through the
towering stones.  The High Aldwin solemnly looks out at
the distant forest.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Now, you know where you're going?
               (Willow shakes his head)
          Down there, through those trees,
          follow the river.  You'll know the
          crossroads by a big daikini struc-
          ture.  Willow, this is serious
          business.  Don't waste any time,
          the outer world is no place for a
          Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first
          daikini you see, then hurry home as
          fast as you can.

                        WILLOW
          If I'm not strong enough to be your
          apprentice, how can I do this?

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          You're strong enough.  But you're
          going to need courage, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          I don't want courage.  I don't want
          to be a warrior.  All I've ever
          wanted was to do magic, real magic,
          like you!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Real magic, Willow, is simply the
          art of controlling the reality of
          others.  You lack faith in your-
          self.  You must learn to trust your
          intuition.

The High Aldwin picks up a rock.  With intense concen-
tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand.  Then
throws it in the air.  It changes into a bird and flies
away.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Go in the direction the bird is
          flying.

                        WILLOW
                       (amazed)
          Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd
          turn Burglekutt into a toad!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Waste magic on revenge?  You have
          much to learn, Willow...

The High Aldwin touches Willow's shoulder and turns
away.  The children are playing tag among the stones.
Willow hugs them.  Kiaya places the baby in the papoose.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, we've never been apart.  I
          miss you already.  Take this.  It
          will bring you luck.

Kiaya, whose head is covered with a kerchief, places a
braided necklace on her own hair around Willow's neck.

                        WILLOW
          You cut your hair, Kiaya?

He kisses her.  The adjusts the papoose and heads off
down the hill.  The others wave goodbye sadly.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her
arms around Willow, tears in her eyes.  At last they
break apart, and Willow begins the journey.

EXT. WOODS - DAY - MONTAGE

Willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain,
amazed and frightened.  Animals rustle in the brush and
he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking
burrs off his legs.  He hides from a fierce bear.  The
bear sees him and runs away.  Willow hurries along,
shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's
weight.

EXT. ROAD - EVENING

The baby is fussing hungrily.  Willow impetuously digs
a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to
feed her.  Then he hears something.  Sensing danger, he
clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank.  He
hides under a bridge.

NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS on horseback thunder toward the
bridge, led by the knight SORSHA whose face is hidden
under a black helmet and visor.  In the other direction
Willow sees a LIEUTENANT and two DEATH DOGS.  They all
meet on the bridge.  The hideous soldiers are part hu-
man, part beast.

                      LIEUTENANT
          We've patrolled the hills.  This is
          where they killed the nursemaid.

                        SORSHA
          She must have done something with
          the child.  Widen the search!

One of the Death Dogs is chewing on the Lieutenant's
stirrup.

                      LIEUTENANT
          Get away from there!

The dog panics and gnashes at the Lieutenant's arm,
ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth.  Horses
rear.  The Lieutenant draws his sword lightning-fast.
He slices and kills the Death Dog.  The baby begins to
cry but the death-howl of the beast drowns her out as
it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below.
The soldiers gallop off into the woods.

Willow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away
from the murdered Death Dog which lies bloody and
twisted in the water.  The terrified baby cries in his
arms.

EXT. ROAD - MORNING

A harmless rabbit springs across Willow's path.  Willow
trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.  Where am I?  I should
          stick you in a tree and go back
          home.
                    (looks at baby)
          I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.

He hurries along the road, looking over his shoulder.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY - MONTAGE

Various VIEWS of Willow and the baby trekking across
vast hills and valleys.

EXT. HILL - DAY

Gasping with exhaustion, Willow staggers up a sloping
hill and drops to his knees.  His eyes brighten.  In
the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden
scaffolding.

                        WILLOW
          That's it.  The crossroads...

He stands and heads toward it cautiously.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The place is disgusting.  Littered with junk, buzzing
with flies, plagued with rodents.  Willow creeps toward
the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench.
From it hang two cages.  In one is a heap of filthy
rags.  In the other a half-clothed skeleton with one
bony arm dangling out.

Willow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted
road.  He shivers with cold.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

Willow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face.
The baby fusses and squirms.  He peeks inside her
diaper.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

He looks anxiously up and down the road.  The baby's
crying gets worse.  He begins to change her.

EXT. CROSSROADS - SUNSET

Willow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint
and blowing it into flame.  The baby lies quietly near-
by in a kind fo porta-crib made of papoose and twigs.
Nightfall teems with spooky noises:  crickets, frogs,
bats, owls and howling wolves.  Then a terrible moan
frightens him.

                        WILLOW
          I really hate this.

Not sure where it came from. he backs away from the
fire, under the rag-filled cage.  Suddenly a hand
reaches down and yanks Willow up off the ground!  Wil-
low screams.  The baby cries.  And WE SEE the haggard
unwashed unshaven face of MADMARTIGAN pressing against
the bars of the cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hey, Peck...get me some water...or
          you'll diiiiie...!

Madmartigan shakes Willow like a rag-doll until Willow
nods his head yes.  Then drops him.  Instantly Willow
races around that fire, picking up everything he owns.

                        WILLOW
          I will--I'll getcha water--getcha
          lotsa water--anything you say--!

Willow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the
bushes.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!

He dives headfirst into the weeds.  Madmartigan rattles
his cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a weasely little Peck!
          Gimme some water!

Willow peeks at him and shakes his head.

                        WILLOW
          I'm not coming near you!

They stare at each other across the fire.  Then, Mad-
martigan puts on a very phony smile.

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Good.  How long will it take?

Madmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't make me angry, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          You be careful.  I'm a powerful
          sorcerer.  I could turn you into a
          toad just like that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Miserable Pecks.

Willow throws a rock at him.  It bounces off the cage.
Madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again.

EXT. CROSSROADs - NIGHT

The wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls.
Willow rocks the baby and eats some bread.  Madmartigan
watches him hungrily, sighing, forlorn, his eyes asking
for pit.  Willow glances at him.  Finally, he can't
take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some
goat's milk in a cup.  He reaches up on tip-toes and
offers the milk to Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's more like it.

Madmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk,
retching horribly at the taste.  Then he tosses the cup
back.

                        WILLOW
          Do any other daikinis ever come by
          here?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Why.

                        WILLOW
          I have to give this baby to some-
          body.

Madmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll
          take care of your baby.

He makes little kissing noises to the baby, trying to
be sweet.  However, his teeth are filthy.

                        WILLOW
          No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a
          reason.  I'll wait for somebody else.

Willow retreats to the fire.  Madmartigan whacks the
cage with the back of his hand.

EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT- LATER

By the blazing fire Willow feeds the baby.  WE HEAR
hoofbeats.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Somebody's coming!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

Excited, Willow tosses more wood on the fire, picks up
the baby and waits.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No, you fool!  Put it out I say!
          Out!

Torches appear up the road.  A horse-drawn wagon
clatters full-speed toward the fire.  WE HEAR load
drunken voices, far from friendly.  Willow quickly
dives into the bushes.

Four boorish PICTS, with tatooed faces and arms, halt
at the crossroads, yelling and waving their torches.
Madmartigan is hidden under his rags.  For fun the
Picts set fire to the skeleton cage.  Then head for the
other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!

He rises up in the torchlight.  The Picts taunt him.

                         PICT
          Whose fire!

They jab their torches at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!  Help!  Stop!

                         PICT
          Where are they?  Where did they go?

Madmartigan points way up the road.  The Picts ride
away.  As they go, they swing his cage and st fire to
the floor of it.  Madmartigan frantically geats the
flames.  His sleeves ignite.

Willow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand-
fuls of dirt, which he chucks at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                  (spitting out dirt)
          Thanks for your help, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          Are you okay?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          As if you care.  I saved your life,
          Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!
                 (points dramatically)
          You wanna give your baby to them??
          They eat babies!

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.

Madmartigan literally licks his wounds, dragging his
parched tongue along the length of his forearm.  Willow
begins to walk away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The world's gone insane.  Good men
          locked in cages, criminals running
          free.  It doesn't pay to be honest,
          Peck.

Willow stops and turns around.

                        WILLOW
          Don't call me a Peck.  My name is
          Willow.

Madmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends
his derty hand through the bars.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan.

Willow stares warily at the hand.  Madmartigan smiles.
Willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away.  Madmar-
tigan laughs in a harmless, friendly way.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You a woodcutter?

                        WILLOW
          Farmer.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic-
          tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me:
          victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor-
          rupt, rotten world.

A rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the
baby in the porta-crib.  Madmartigan suddenly points.
Willow screams and chases the rat away.  Madmartigan
shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm
          really a good man.  Give me my
          freedom, and I'll look after that
          baby for you.  Trust me.

After a moment, Willow takes out his dagger.  He stands
on his toes under a cage, reaches up, and hacks at the
chain lock.  Madmartigan's eyes widen over-eagerly.  he
rubs his hands together and licks his lips.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's it--good--good--like that,
          yes, good, good, the chain--that's
          it, come on--come on--!

Willow suddenly steps away.

                        WILLOW
          Nooo, I don't think I should.

Madmartigan goes berserk.  His arms flail and the whole
cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the
roof.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya!
          Let me out!

Willow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the
baby and rocks her in his arms.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAWN

Madmartigan is making something out of scraps of bark
and cloth.  He smiles sweetly as Willow wakes up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Morning, Willow.

Willow turns his back on him and tends to the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been
          in this cage toooo long.  Can't
          think straight anymore.  Owww...!

Willow looks over.  madmartigan pats his arms in pain.

                        WILLOW
          You all right?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

He holds up his arms in agony.  Willow fishes some
gooey jelly out of his sack and smears a gob of it on a
leaf.  He hands it up to Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          See if this helps.

Madmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made
          something for the baby.

He holds out a ratlle and shakes it.  Willow accepts
it.

                        WILLOW
          What's inside?

Madmartigan sticks his finger in his mouth and pries it
open as wide as possible.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A tooth.
                   (Willow reacts)
          I'm strving.  I got no used for it.

Noise in the distance.  up the road Willow sees a
MESSENGER charging on horseback.  He gallops right
past, whipping his horse, almost knocking Willow off
the road.  Then another MESSENGER follows with the same
urgency.  Willow grabs the baby and steps out to stop
him.

                        WILLOW
          Stop!  Wait!

The messenger screams a Willow who jumps aside as he
thunders by.  The two horsemen disappear up the road.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                   (with authority)
          Smells like a battle.

                        WILLOW
          Are you a warrior?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The greatest swordsman that ever
          lived.

Madmartigan slices the air with an imaginary sword.
Willow shakes his head and goes back to the baby.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

WE SEE the empty road.  Willow's head pops INTO FRAME.
He grabs the baby.

                        WILLOW
          What's that?  I hear something!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You hear trouble.

                        WILLOW
          What is it?

The horizon rumbles.  Madmartigan cups his ear.  Cyni-
cally:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A hundred horses...five or six
          wagons...  and about six thousand
          fools.

Two CAVALRY OFFICERS gallop into view, raising a plume
of dust.  Then an enormous ARMY appears:  cavalry, foot
soldiers, assault wagons: shields, swords, spears,
raised banners.

The two officers shout orders over the thunderous
clamor of hoofbeats, marching boots and clanking armor.
Charging back and forth, they shepherd the army through
the crossroads.  Willow holds the baby.  Fighting dust
and noise he tries to get the officer's attention.

                        WILLOW
          Sir?  Sir!

                        OFFICER
          Out of the way!

An officer's horse nearly kicks Willow, who scurries
out of the way.  Huddling with the baby, he notices
AIRK THAUGHBAER, a large, muscular, bearded officer,
clearly in charge.  On horseback, Airk breaks file and
rides up to the other officers.

                         AIRK
          Push 'em harder!  No rest at mid-
          day!  We need to make ten more
          leagues by dark!

Shouting orders, the officers split up, charging to the
front and rear of the army.  Airk watches the army
pass.  Willow desperately scrambles up to him.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We
          found her in our village.  Will you
          take her...?

Huge Airk looks down from his huge horse.  Little Wil-
low holds up the baby.

                         AIRK
          We're going into battle, little
          one.  Find a woman to take care of
          it.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He thought you were a woman, Airk!

Airk snaps hes head around and his eyes flash.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan!  What did you do this
          time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nothing you wouldn't have done it my
          place!

Airk's horse prances menacingly around Madmartigan's
cage.

                         AIRK
          I always knew you'd end up in a
          crow's cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Least I'm not down there herding
          sheep!

Airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage.

                         AIRK
          You're lucky somebody got to you
          first, Madmartigan!  I'd've killed
          you myself after that stunt at
          Land's End!

He swings that cage and starts to ride away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa
          here.

                         AIRK
                  (really sarcastic)
          Hey, remember?  You don't need my
          help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit
          trap like this?  Come on!  I could
          open it for you, but I wouldn't
          wanna insult you!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your
          war for you.

Airk quickly drops the banter and glares at Madmartigan seri-
ously.

                         AIRK
          You're nothing but trouble, Madmar-
          tigan.  And I got plenty of that.
          Stay in your coffin and rot!

Airk spurs his horse and smashes the cage as he charges
off.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll be around long after you're
          dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get
          outa here I'll cut your head off
          and stick it on a pig-pole!

                        WILLOW
          Friend of yours?

Madmartigan snarls down at Willow as the army continues
to march by.  But then he quickly gets cute again.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, little baby...

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

A ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads.  The road
is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks.  Willow
shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

Madmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his
cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nobody's gonna take your baby.
          Know why?  Nobody cares...
                        (beat)
          Except me.
                      (wistfully)
          You wanna go back to your farm.
          You wanna go back to your family.
          I could take care of that baby.
          I'll look after her like she was me
          own.

                        WILLOW
          You don't know anything about ba-
          bies.

Madmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his
finger astutely.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women
          who do.  Why, if I had somebody in
          my life--a little daughter for
          instance--I'd have a reason to
          live...

He clsps his hands together outside the bars, plead-
ing:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow.  You can't let me die here.
          Not when I wanna help you.

Willow looks at the baby in the porta-crib.  Then looks
up the empty road.  Then looks hard at Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          You gotta promise to feed her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I will.

                        WILLOW
          Fresh goat's milk.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Absolutely!

Willow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the
chain.

                        WILLOW
          And give her a bath everyday, and
          don't let her get cold.  And keep
          her diaper changed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Of course!  I promise!

Willow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks
open.  The bottom of the cage falls out, dumping Mad-
martigan into a heap of rags and dust.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come to Daddy, little darlin'.
                    (picks her up)
          I think she likes me!

Kneeling on the ground, he plays with the baby.  Willow
quickly hitches the papoose to Madmartigan's back and
hands him supplies.

                        WILLOW
          Here are her diaper rags.  And this
          is her milk bladder.  And when she
          cries--she's either hungry or she's
          tired--rock her on your left
          shoulder.  She likes that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good
          hands.  You haven't made a mistake.

Willow takes the baby and kisses her.

                        WILLOW
          Bye.

He puts her in the papoose.

                        WILLOW
                   (to Madmartigan)
          Please take good care of her.

Madmartigan stands up.  He towers above Willow.  He
pats Willow on the head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You've done a great job.  Now you
          go back to your family and get your
          crop in.

Madmartigan smiles, turns, and marches off down the
road.  Willow sighs with relief, his task accomplished.
He watches Madmartigan and the baby disappear over a
hill.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Swinging his arms and whistling a tune, Willow struts
proudly up a gentle hill.

                        WILLOW
          Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's
          come home!  Welcome back, Willow!
          He deserves a medal:  he's quite
          mystical.  For honor, for bravery,
          for his intuitive powers...
                     (he chuckles)
           ...let's make him Apprentice
          Aldwin.  Better still:  High
          Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf-
          good, High Aldwin of---

The baby cries!  Willow spins around.  Flying towrd
him is an incredible VULTURE with enormous winds.  In
its claws it carries the baby, papoose and all.  It
swoops straight at Willow, buzzing him, and Willow hits
the dirt.  He looks up.  To add to the wonder:  riding
the vulutre is an ELF.

                        WILLOW
          Come back here, you!  That's my
          baby!!

The vulture zooms off into the tall majestic trees of
the forest, with the baby crying.  Shouting and waving
madly, Willow gallops after it.

EXT. THROUGH THE FOREST - DAY

Willow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the
towering trees.  As the path narrows, something whis-
tlse past his ear.  Finger-length arrows rain down on
him from every direction, peppering the surrounding
trees.  Some even hit Willow.  He plucks them out as he
races along.

He comes to a fork in the path:  Decision!  He starts
down one way, then slams on the brakes.  He sees ropes
and nets.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no, it's a trap!

He hurries back to the fork and takes the safer route--

                        WILLOW
          Oh noooooo!!

--and gets swallowed by a deadly pit.

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - UNDERGROUND

Willow wakes up as a pail of water hits him in the
face.  His feet and wrists are being bound.  Several
little ELVES are gawking and laughing at him.  They
wear samurai-type outfits and angry little haircuts.

                        WILLOW
                      (focusing)
          Where am I?  Where's the baby?

FRANJEAN, the Elfin king, struts forward arrogantly.
He speaks a haughty, nasal accent resembling French:

                       FRANJEAN
          I am Franjean, king of the world.

Willow struggles against the ropes that bind him.

                        WILLOW
          That baby's my responsibility!

Outraged, Franjean smacks Willow's nose with the
back of his hand.

                       FRANJEAN
          I don't care.  We paid for her.  Go
          back to sleep, monsieur...

As he leaves, Franjean nods to an intense-looking ARCH-
ER elf heavily armed with arrows and a spear.  The
archer dips his spear in a bowl of purple liquid.  He
pricks Willow's arm.

                        WILLOW
          Yeow!
                (he loses consciousness)
          Madmartigan...I never should've
          trusted you...

FADE TO BLACK

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - DAWN

Willow's eyes open.  A wild little face is looking at
him.  A wild little person is standing on his chest.

                         TEEMO
          Tongue.

Too groggy to argue, Willow sticks out his tongue.
TEEMO the brownie crushes a brittle leaf and tosses the
dust into Willow's mouth.  Smacking his lips, Willow
comes around.  He sees, down between his legs, another
brownie named ROOL cutting the ropes.

                        WILLOW
          Who are you?

                         ROOL
          Quiet, you fool!

                         TEEMO
                       (formal)
          We are emissaries of her majesty,
          Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of
          Coshairm.

                        WILLOW
          Queen Cherlindrea?

                         TEEMO
          She requests the presence of your-
          self and the young princess.

                        WILLOW
          Who??

                         TEEMO
          You're the guardian, aren't you?

                         ROOL
          Quit yakking, Teemo.  We gotta get
          outa here!

Willow rolls onto his knees, stands up and bumps his
head on the ceiling.  The fuzzy-headed brownies creak
open the door and becon Willow to follow.  He squeezes
through.

INT. ELFIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND

Like a rabbit warren, compartments branch off the main
tunnel.  Willow scrunches along behind the tip-toeing
brownies.  They hear the baby crying.  They peek
through the door.

Inside a cluttered room they see thebaby crying miser-
ably.  Her tears are being carried to a high level in
tiny buckets on a mechanized wheel, operated by FOUR
ELVES.

                         TEEMO
          Elves!  They're always tormenting
          babies.  They make them cry and
          take their tears.

                         ROOL
          Somebody has to do it.

                        WILLOW
          Why??

                         ROOL
          How else they gonna make dew drops?

The baby shrieks.

                        WILLOW
          I'm getting her out of there!

                         TEEMO
          No!  You let us handle this.  Come
          along, Rool!

Teemo ridiculously pushes Willow away from the door.
With a macho swagger he adjusts his dagger belt, and he
and Rool open the door.

INT. ELFIN TEAR FACTORY

They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.  The four
elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them.
Teemo draws his small dagger.  With confidence he
smiles at Rool.

                         TEEMO
          Watch this.  Right between the
          eyes.

                         ROOL
                    (to the elves)
          He never misses.

Artfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.  With
all his might he throws.  His dagger flip-flops through
the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk.

                         TEEMO
          Ooops.  Was that right?  That
          wasn't right.

Suddenly the entire wall implodes.  The elves scream
and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong.
He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm.

EXT. ELF HOLE - DAY

The brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where
the elves keep their vultures corralled.

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Hyah!  Hyah!  Git!

They untie th evulture and send them flapping away in
the forest as Willow wiggles out of the elf hole with
the baby.  They run for their lives.

EXT. FOREST - CHASE - DAY

Rool and teemo tear along at incredible speed, Willow
barely keeping up with them.  Little elf arrows shower
the forest as the angry elves chase after them, whoop-
ing and screaming.

EXT. DEEP GORGE - DAY

They skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion.
The elves are shrieking toward them. The only chance
of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge.
The brownies scamper out.  Willow looks down and reels
with vertigo.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go out there with the baby!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
                  (frantically point)
          Elves!!

The elf army pours out of the forest.  Willow holds his
breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of
the tree.  Arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a
drunken tightrope walker toward the middle.  The brown-
ies wait for him.

                        WILLOW
          Ohhh, I hate this.

                         TEEMO
          Take your time.  Don't worry about
          the elves.  They won't come out
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Why not?

                         ROOL
          Because of the trolls.

                        WILLOW
          Trolls?

The brownies console Willow with unworried laughter.

                         TEEMO
          Relax.  They only come out at
          night.

An ugly TROLL snarls up behind Willow.  They all scream
and race for the other side.  Another TROLL pops up to
meet them.  The trolls slink along like possums.  The
brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk.

The elves, meanwhile, flint-start a fire at their end
of the tree.  One troll claws at the brownies inside
the trunk while the other chases Willow across gangling
branches.  Then the baby falls out of the papoose!  She
tumbles and catches on a low branch and Willow races
the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into
the gorge.

One troll catches Rool but can't then get his claw out
of the trunk.  The brownies finally excape.  The tree
burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots.
A troll howls as he falls to his death.  The other
scrambles up the tree and grabs Willow's foot.
Willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll.

Flames lick at Willow as he at last hauls himself to
safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree
goes crashing down in the gorge.

                        WILLOW
          This is not going well.

                         TEEMO
          Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know
          what to do.

Willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into
the forest.  Hobbling slightly on his bootless foot.

EXT. MAJESTIC FOREST - SUNSET

Fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful
trees as Willow and the brownies trek into the magical
Fairy Kingdom.  Elora Danan falls into a peaceful
sleep.

EXT. FAIRY KINGDOM - NIGHT

Willow comes to a halt.  His mouth drops open.  The
forest is a luminous Milky Way of dancing, flying
FAIRIES, like fireflies.  The brownies tug at his
pant-legs and whisper.

                         TEEMO
          Come on.  This is a privilege.  No-
          body ever gets called before Her
          Majesty.

Wonder-struck, Willow walks into a clearing where
colorful night-flowers bloom.  He lowers himself onto
an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand.  Other
BROWNIES stand watching, like courtiers.  The tiny
fairies fly up to Willow's face and giggle:  they look
like five-year-old girls, full of mischief and fun.

Suddenly a strange LIGHT begins to throb behind the
trees, peircing the forest with helter-skelter beams.
Willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings
his eyes.

                         ROOL
          Stand up!  It's the queen!

CHERLINDREA, the Fairy Queen, materializes out of frag-
ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph-like, beauti-
ful.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Willow Ufgood.

                        WILLOW
                       (blinded)
          Yes...?

                      CHERLINDREA
          I hope you are comfortable here,
          inside my kingdom...

Willow says nothing, still batling the bright light.

                         TEEMO
          Talk!  Say something!

                        WILLOW
          I can't see anything--she's too
          bright!

                      CHERLINDREA
          I'm sorry...

The light diminishes, enabling Willow to see the queen.
She is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi-
nous eyes.  Her magical presence both stuns and
impresses Willow.  She turns to the brownies.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Broke-heart of nightingale for our
          honored guest.

All the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into
action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip-
ping over one another.  They bring Willow a drink in a
delicate cup-shaped leaf, and he takes a sip.

The queen dissolves and reappears near Willow.  She le-
ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at
the mark on the baby's arm.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy
          has come true.

The tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh
with respect and amazement.  Cherlindrea seems to levi-
tate the baby out of Willow's arms, floating her magi-
cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks.  The
brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever-
ence.

                        WILLOW
          You mean, you know who this baby
          belongs to?

                      CHERLINDREA
          She belongs to all of us.  She is
          the future queen and ruler of all
          kingdoms on earth.

Willow starts to get up.

                        WILLOW
          What a relief.  Now I can go home.

The queen fragments and reappears right in front of
Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          No, Willow.  Your journey has just
          begun.  It has been foretold that
          this child shall bring about the
          downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose
          evil powers have darkened our
          world.  Upon you depends this
          princess's life.

                        WILLOW
          Me?

The Fairy Queen flashes and vanishes.  Willow lowers
himself back down again.  She reappears behind him.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are the guardian, Willow.  You
          must take her to Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          What is Tir Asleen?

Willow can't keep track of her.  She keeps changing her
shape.  The brownies and fairies snicker at Willow's
confusion.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is a distant castle, where a
          great king and queen will look
          after Elora Danan and keep her safe
          until she is old enough to rule.

She is gone again.  Willow looks everywhere, frusturated
by these riddles and mysteries.

                        WILLOW
          Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is
          it?

She reappears again.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The way has been lost in time. But
          there is one person, a druid sor-
          ceress, who might guide you there.
          She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda
          many years ago.  Her name is Fin
          Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You need a warrior for this job.
          I'm nobody.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are very important, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          No I'm not.  Have you really looked
          at me?
                  (jumps to his feet)
          I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

From down at his feet, Rool and Teemo stare up, insult-
ed.

                        WILLOW
                     (continuing)
          Why can't you do it?  You have mag-
          ical powers.

                      CHERLINDREA
          My prsence cannot extend beyond
          this forest.  But I can give you
          these...

Cherlindrea drops three small objects in Willow's hand.

                      CHERLINDREA
          They will protect you.  Use them
          wisely.

Willow looks at them for quite a while.

                        WILLOW
          They look like acorns.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Anything you hurl them at will turn
          to stone.

Willow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the
queen.

                        WILLOW
          They're magic?  Are you serious?

The forest light grows brighter.  The queen looms over
Willow and he again has to shield himself from the
brightness.

                      CHERLINDREA
                       (sternly)
          I am very serious, Willow.  There
          is no time to lose.

Now she intensifies her light so that Willow backs
away, completely covering his face.

                        WILLOW
          But I've got a family to think
          about!  They need me!

The queen swirls around him like a solar wind, blowing
the forest trees, scaring even the brownies.  And then
all of a sudden:  silence.  And total darkness.  ALL WE
SEE, in dim moonlight, is Willow's face, peeking out
from between his fingers.

                        WILLOW
          Hello...?

The queen's voice echoes the forest.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Bavmord'a powers are growing like
          an evil plague.  Soon she will con-
          trol the lives of you children,
          your wife, your village...everyone.

Very gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin
to flicker, restoring light to the forest.  More light
genlty brightens, bathing the woods, and the Fairy
Queen reappears.  She is holding Elora Danan in her
arms.  The brownies creep out from behind the trees.
All eyes are upon Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The choice is yours.

Willow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment.
He struggles with his conscience.  The fairies and
brownies wait in anticipation.  At last Willow looks up
at them, resolved and determined.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do
          it!

The fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause.
Fairies giggle playfully around Willow's face, and
brownies hug his ankles.

                        WILLOW
          But I only have one shoe.

EXT. WOODED HILL - DAY

WE SEE Willow's feet as he walks along.  He has himself
a brand-new shoe.

Spirits high, he treks in the sunshine, papoose
strapped to his back.  Teemo rides in his pocket, while
Rool straddles the papoose, tickling the giggling baby.

                        WILLOW
          Wait till I tell my children.
          Stuff like this never happens in my
          village.

He digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it
high in the air.  The brownies gasp.

                         TEEMO
          Hey, careful there!

                        WILLOW
          How do these work I wonder?  I got-
          ta save one to show the High
          Aldwin.

                         ROOL
          Look!  Death below!

Rool points through the trees.  Willow hurries down the
hill to the tree-line.  In the valley below, 200 NOCK-
MAAR SOLDIERS and CALVALRYMEN battle a hundred ragtag
REBEL TROOPS.  From this sage position high on the
hillside, Willow watches in disgust.  Weapons clash and
men fall to their deaths.

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis...

They hear a CLANK behind them.  Willow slowly turns
around.  There is movement in the trees.  The hillside
woods are full of Nockmaar HORSEMEN moving right up next to him.

In the valley, the oupowered rebels are being forced
up the hill toward them.  Willow is suddenly standing
under several large horses and black-armored minions.
He is frozen in fear.

                       HORSEMEN
          Hyaaaaahh!!

Swords flash and the horseman charge!  The brownies
jump and run for their lives.  Willow stumbles and
spins as horse after horse thunders past him, nearly
trampling him and the baby to death.

The Nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining
rebels and crush them.  Willow falls and quickly digs
the baby out of the papoose.  She is shrieking in ter-
ror.  He holds her tight and runs along the tree-line,
following the brownies, while the bloody battle rages
below.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't
          cry, Elora.  Things can't get any
          worse than this...

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Bleak rain dribbles down Willow's miserable face.  Pro-
tecting the baby, he hurries toward a tavern.  The bot-
tom of the building is an open stable with several
horses.  Two burly IRON-WORKERS clank a red-hot wagon
rim, fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse.

It's a rough place.  Rool and Teemo peek out of
Willow's pockets.  Upstairs PEOPLE drink and shout.

                         TEEMO
          I'm not going in there.

                         ROOL
          Me neither!

                        WILLOW
          Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What
          could possibly happen?

Suddenly there's a CRASH up above and two PICTS burst
through a balcony and land in the mud, fighting vi-
ciously.  Rool and Teemo duck inside Willow's pockets.
Willow steps around the Picts, dashes through the
stable and up the stairs.

INT. TAVERN - MAIN ROOM - DAY

The place is packed with tattooed PICTS, nomadic FAMI-
LIES, MOTHERS wit BABIES, THIEVES and CUTTHROATS.
Willow enters with the crying baby.

                        WILLOW
          Could you spare some milk for this
          poor hungry baby?

Everyone looks up.  Mopping a table is an ugly BARMAID
as big as a wrestler.

                        BARMAID
          Get outa here, Peck!

                        PATRONS
          A Peck!  Get him out!  Beat it,
          Peck!

They hurl stuff at him and threaten him with their
weapons.  Willow runs along the wall and takes cover
under some stairs.  He pulls open his pocket and peers
down inside.

                        WILLOW
          I could use your help, boys.

Instantly his pocket whips shut and trembles.  Willow
cautiously looks out under the stairs.  He sees a pail
of milk very near some ROUGHNECKS.  Willow puts his
little finger in the baby's mouth, silencing her.  He
creeps out.  And bravely reaches for the milk.

                     TEEMO'S VOICE
          Willow?

Willow slaps his pocket.  Then stretches his arm out
very, very slowly.  And gets the pail and zips back
under the stairs.

                        WILLOW
          This is not fun.

He soaks a rag with milk and feeds the baby.  Catching
his breath, he backs up and leans agains a woodplank
wall.

                        WILLOW
          Woah!

The plank gives way and Willow falls through the wall.

INT. TAVERN - DAY

Willow somersaults into a bedroom near an unmade bed.
Peeking up he sees two women getting dressed in a pan-
ic.  One is a plump-chested WENCH with a pretty face.

                         WENCH
          Hurry!  Hurry!

Very frightened, she looks out the window.  The other
woman, who wears a kerchief over her hair, packs thick
powder and make-up paint on her face.

                   THE OTHER WOMAN
                  (in a gruff voice)
          How do I look?

It's Madmartigan!  Willow pops up like a jack-in-the-
box.

                        WILLOW
          You!!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Where the hell did you come from?

Willow strides toward Madmartigan, holding the baby
like a machine gun.

                        WILLOW
          I trusted you...

The brownies peek out.

                         ROOL
          Who's he?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're crawling with rodents.

The bedroom door explodes open.  In storms a big, mean,
half-drunk raging lug named LLUG.

                         LLUG
          Where is he!!

Madmartigan wraps a muffler around his throat.  The
wench innocently curtsies.

                         WENCH
          There's nobody here except me and
          my, um, cousin.

Llug knocks his wife out of the way and glares susi-
ciously at Madmartigan, who bats his heavily made-up
eyelashes.  He speaks in a high feminine voice.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          How do you do.

Llug sniffs at Madmartigan then fixes his gaze on
Madmartigan's flat chest.  He goes to squeeze him
there, but Madmartigan ducks out of the way and
snatches the baby from Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Give me that baby!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          These Pecks make terrible nurse-
          maids.

                        WILLOW
          Nursemaid?!

Willow angrily jumps up and down, swiping at the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          They get too excited.

With a swing of the hip, Madmartigan butts Willow aside
and maternally puts the baby against his chest.  Llug
houd-dogs him around the room, finally cornering him
and staaring lecherously into his eyes.

                         LLUG
          Wanna breeeeeeed?


Madmartigan protects himself by holding the baby up in
front of his face.  Then he smells the baby.  He winces
and groans.

                        WILLOW
                   (mischievously)
          Time to change her diaper.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time to leave.

Madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out.  But
he doesn't get very far.  Several NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS
push him back in.  Then they grab madmartigan and Wil-
low, and Llug and his wife, and haul them all outside.

INT. TAVERN - HALLWAY - DAY

Madmartigan is slammed against a wall.  The Willow.
Then Llug and his wife.  In the b.g. Nockmaar troops
are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from
frightened mothers and inspecting them.

Heavy bootsteps thud toward them.  Willow looks out and
recognizes Sorsha, the black-helmeted knight from the
bridge.

                        SORSHA
          You!  Are you the mother of that
          child?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No.
           (looks at Llug; in a high voice)
          I mean yes.

Sorsha strides over to Madmartigan, her sword drawn.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

                        WILLOW
          No!  You can't!

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Why not?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Willow)
          Why not?

                        WILLOW
          Because she's sick.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Sorsha)
          Because she's sick.

                        SORSHA
          Give it to me!

Sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike.
She grabs for the baby.  Instinctively, Madmartigan el-
bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off-
balance against a nearby bench.  The soldiers tense up,
pointing their swords and spears.

Sorsha regains her balance.  She rips off her black
helmet.  Long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders.
She is a young woman, and Madmartigan's eyes pop open.
He does his best to keep up his femal facade.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          Gawd...you're...beautiful...

                        SORSHA
          You're not a woman.

Sorsha comes right up to Madmartigan, squinting into
his eyes.  The she rips away his kerchief and muffler.

                         LLUG
          Not a woman??!!

All hell breaks loose.  Llug charges for Madmartigan's
throat.  Madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and
dashes right out the window.  Llug bulldozes Sorsha and
her Lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage
of the chaos and stampede for the stairs.  Willow dives
out the window after Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          After them!!

She grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who
clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their
way.

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Madmartigna jumps off the upstairs balcony and lands in
the wagon below.  The two iron-workers look up with
concern.  Then they react with surprise as Madmartigan
rips away his disguise.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Wait!

Up above, Willow charges along the balcony.  Madmarti-
gan juggles the baby and whips the reins.  The wagon
pulls away, iron-workers scrambling after it.  Willow
flings himself off the balcony.  The brownies tumble
out of his pocket.  They all land in the back of the
wagon as it takes off.

It has stopped raining.  In the stable under the
tavern, horses smash together and people fall in the
mud, and the Nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the
traffic jam.

EXT. ROAD - CHASE - DAY

As Madmartigan lashes the horse, Willow crawls up to
hum and takes the baby.

                        WILLOW
          We could've been killed, Madmarti-
          gan!

In the back, the brownies boucne all over the place
amid wooden kegs and other objects.  When they finally
get their balane they look back in alarm.

Chasing them are two Nockmaar HORSEMEN plus a DEATH DOG
and a war chariot.

Willow ducks low and peeks out, protectively hugging
the baby.  The wagon bounces and flies along, but the
minions are quickly gaining.  Rool and Teemo spring
into action.  They struggle with all their might and
manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the
wagon.

The kegs bounce onto the road, and the minions lose
some ground trying to avoid them.  But soon the horse-
men flank the wagon.  One leaps off his galloping horse
and climbs on board.  The other draws an arrow and gets
ready to fire.

Madmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes.  He
quickly rolls into the back.  The archer firse! and
hits the other minion in the chest.  Madmartigna snaps
a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes
the wounded minion off the wagon:  he crashes onto the
road.

Willow harnesses the papoose to his chest and grabs the
reins.  At the same time the minion archer leaps
aboard.  He and Madmartigan fight in the back.

                        WILLOW
          Heeyah!  Heeyah!

Then there's a terrible howl right beside Willow.  The
Death Dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and
trying to board.  Willow yanks the reins and swerves
the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously.  In the
back, Madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the
swerving jolt.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no!

Up ahead Willow sees an exposed tree root in the road.
The wagon is headed straight for it!  The wheel hits
the root hard and Willow is dumped onto the wagon floor
and very nearly goes overboard.

In the back, Madmartigan and the minion keep fighting
as the wagon clatter along out of control.  The Death
Dog catches up again and this time spring aboard.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

The dog snaps at the baby.  Willow scurries under the
wagon seat.  The dog stands up on its hind feet.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

It gets ready to attack.  But WHACK! an overhanging
tree branch hits it and Willow looks up from under the
seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling
from the tree, rapidly disappearing in the distance.

In the back, meanwhile, the minion draws a knife.  Mad-
martigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at
the edge of the tailgate.  The minion comes after him.

Suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off.
The jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan
kicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but
holds on, dragged by the wagon.

Rool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large
wooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and
sending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up
in horror as the heavy keg crushes him.

But the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along
with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins
and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them
is the war chariot!

The Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the
reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to
twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his
head.

Madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post.
The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK!
It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the
chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up
each other.  At last Madmartigan lets go of the post
and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the
airl, over a cliff to his death.

                        WILLOW
          Woah...woah...!

Willow tries to stop the horse.  But the wheel col-
lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch.  The brownies
dive overboard.  Madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately
sends the wagon up the road.  He scrambles down into
the ditch and lies flat beside Willow.

Suddenly, hoofbeats thunder and Sorsha and the rest of
her troops gallop past.  Lying flat, Madmartigna raises
his head and sees Sorsha's long flowing red hair.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That girl is a vision.

As soon as the troops are gone, Willow jumps up.

                        WILLOW
          Where's the baby??

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I thought you had her!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Willow!!

The brownies are waving and gesturing madly, pointing
at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the
wagon.  Willow and Madmartigan race over and start dig-
ging, flinging debris aside.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now Willow, I know you're gonna
          blame me for this but it wasn't my
          fault...!

                        WILLOW
          Elora Danan!

Willow sees the battered, lifeless papoose.  He grabs
it and rips it open.  Madmartigan kneels in the dirt
remorsefully.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          When I left the crossroads, I got
          ambushed by an elf!

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I did?

Willow holds up the baby.  She giggles and smiles.
Madmartigan switches gears, boasting:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I mean, of course I saved her life.
          She's almost my daughter, isn't
          she?

Willow bundles the baby and looks up the road.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here before they
          come back.

They hurry off into the darkening woods.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

A campfire blazes.  Willow tends the baby while the
brownies point up at the stars.

                         TEEMO
          Northeast is that way.  We've come
          west and south.  I think.

Madmartigan dumps a big log on the fire, spraying the
brownies with sparks.

                         ROOL
          Watch it!  You're gonna set us on 
          fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not a bad idea.

Madmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick.  Then
he squats beside Willow and the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So you're on your way to Tir
          Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you
          this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't
          exist.

                        WILLOW
          Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The Fairy Queen?  And the baby
          here's a princess?  And these two
          rodents are your guides?

He shakes his head sceptically, stretches out and puts
his feet up on a log.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah well...in the morning I think
          I'll be on my way.

He laughs sarcastically.  Willow sets down the baby.  He
takes off Kiaya's necklace and fingers it sadly.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, I need your help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My help?  A great magician like
          you?  You don't need any help.

Willow stares at him angrily.

                        WILLOW
          But you're a great swordsman!

He jumps and starts pacing around the fire.  Rool and
Teemo dive for cover.

                        WILLOW
                      (explodes)
          You're not a warrior, Madmartigan!
          A warrior wouldn't lie there and do
          nothing!

He kicks Madmartigan's boot and knocks his feet off the
log.

                        WILLOW
          We're in trouble!  You've seen the
          big army that's after us!  You're a
          fake!  You're a bum!  You're a--
          you're a coward!!

He picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire,
sending up a shower of sparks.  Madmartigan eyes him
with concern.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What's with you, Peck?

Willow lets it all pour out.  He begins to cry.

                        WILLOW
          I miss my wife!  I miss my chil-
          dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing
          up so fast, he even helps me on the
          farm now!  And little Mims!  If you
          ever saw her sweet little face
          you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd
          *melt*!
                      (sniffles)
          Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't
          know anything about love.  You
          don't know anything about any-
          thing...

Willow sits on the ground, exhausted.  Madmartigan
picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I was in love once, Willow.  She
          had a hold on my heart.  I could
          barely function.
                       (a pause)
          I *was* a great swordsman!  I was
          knighted!  I could have been king!

                        WILLOW
          You?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed
          me.  She robbed me of my dream.

Madmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the
fire.  Willow watches him curiously.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll never fall in love again...

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

Willow wakes up and looks around.  The baby is gone.
He panics.  He scrambles a short distance through
some bushes.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Madmartigan!

They've been camped all night near the shore of a LAKE.
Willow finds Madmartigan and the baby bathing happily
in the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Relax, Willow.  We're having fun.

The baby squeals with delight as Madmartigan twirls her
around.  He lifts her yp and carries her to Willow on
the shore.  The brownies crawl thorugh the bushes.
Rool points out at the lake.

                         ROOL
          That's it!  The sorceress lives
          there!

In the middle of the lake is an island with a single
tree.

                         TEEMO
          Are you sure?

                         ROOL
                       (excited)
          Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on
          that island!

Madmartigan lets out a sarcastic, sceptical laugh.
Teemo scratches his head and squints out at the island.

                         TEEMO
          That tree dosn't look like gold to
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gold!!

Madmartigan rubs his chin with sudden interest.

                         TEEMO
          Its branches are supposed to be
          made of gold, solid gold.

                        WILLOW
          How are we going to get out there?

Madmartigan is suddenly pacing and thinking.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll find a way, Willow.  Look
          over there--that looks like a
          village--maybe they've got a boat.
          Come on, what are you waiting for?

Madmartigan runs along the shore toward a small village
in the distance.

EXT. DESERTED FISHING VILLAGE - DAY

Half a dozen decrepit huts sit rotting on the edge of
the lake.  There are no inhabitants, just a lot of dis-
carded junk, including a few battered fishing boats.
But Madmartigan, keeping one eye on the gold tree out
on the island, is undaunted.  He rummages through the
debris, hauling out a fishing boat and shouldering it
toward the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Give me a hand here, Peck!

Willow hoists the baby into the papoose and helps Mad-
martigan.

                          BOY
          What are you doing?

They turn around.  A golden-haired BOY is standing
waist-deep in th elake.  Madmartigan is instantly wary
of him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          It's nothing to do with you.

But the boy looks innocent and harmless, and Willow ap-
proaches him.

                        WILLOW
          We need to get out to that island.

                          BOY
          The island is cursed.

Madmartigan scoffs at this nonsense, grunting and push-
ing the boat into the water.

                        WILLOW
          We've traveled a long way.  We're
          looking for Fin Raziel.

                         TEEMO
          The sorceress.

                          BOY
          She's there.  But you can't go
          there.  The island is cursed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (no patience)
          Yeah?  Who cursed it?

                          BOY
          Queen Bavmorda.  Her powers govern
          the elements.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahh, he's trying to protect the
          gold.  Come on, Willow.  Jump in.

Madmartigan climbs into the boat and grabs an oar,
eager to go.  Willow looks down at the brownies for
help.

                        WILLOW
          What would the Fairy Queen say?

                         ROOL
          She's not here.

                         TEEMO
                       (to Rool)
          Obviously.

                        WILLOW
          Without Raziel we'll never find Tir
          Asleen.
                      (decision)
          We'd better go.

Willow marches to the boat.  Calmly accepting their
choice, the golden-haired boy dives into the lake and
disappears.  Willow and the brownies board the boat,
and Madmartigan poles them away from the shore.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

They row across the placid lake toward the island.

EXT. ISLAND - DAY

They climb onto the rocky shore.  Flies buzz and swarm
around them, and creepy bugs crawl around their feet.
Broken skeletons litter the shore.  Handing the baby
back and forth, Willow and Madmartigan claw their way
up to the large tree.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel?

Madmartigan greedily reaches up to touch a branch.

                        RAZIEL
          Get away!  Get away!

A littel animal scurries down the tree and hisses vi-
ciously at Madmartigan, chattering its teeth.

                        RAZIEL
          You'll die!  You'll die!

RAZIEL scampers over to Willow.  Her voice screeches
like a parrot.  She looks like an otter with a bush
tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Who are you!  Who are you!

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to
          find Fin Raziel.

She springs right onto Willow's chest.

                        RAZIEL
          That's me!  Raziel!  Raziel!

Willow looks down at the browines questioninghly.

                        WILLOW
          This can't be right.  This isn't a
          sorceress.  This is some kind of
          animal.

                         TEEMO
          Queen Bavmorda transformed her.

                        RAZIEL
          What do you want!

                        WILLOW
          We need your help.  To take this
          baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin-
          cess.

Still sceptical, Willow shows Raziel the baby's mark.
Raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks
her tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Elora Danan!

Madmartigan snaps a branch off the tree.  A flock of
birds suddenly screech and fly away.  His eyes bulge.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Rool!  Teemo!  You were right!
          This whole tree is made of gold!!

He strips away the bark, revealing a vein of gold.

                        RAZIEL
          Fools!  You should never have come
          to this place!  We're all going to
          die!

The wind begins to blow and the sky darkens.  Raziel
zips over to Willow and whispers intensely.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got to get off this island
          right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's
          our only chance!

The wind howls.  they hurry down to the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!

Madmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Wait!  Gold!  Gold!

Waves lash at the boat as they jump aboard.  Madmarti-
gan loads up with branches.  As they push off, he
scrambles down the rocks.  Just in time he jumps into
the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy
lake.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Willow clutches the baby as the raging storm pitches
the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Help, Madmartigan!  The oar!

Madmartigan hangs onto his gold, but pices of it drop
and topple overboard.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My gold!

Suddenly a hand appears on the stern.  The water boy
climbs in.

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

                        WILLOW
          No!

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

Madmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back
into the lake.  The boy surfaces like a dolphin.  His
shape begins to change, becoming fish-like, diving and
vanishing.

Then:  he attacks the boat!  He is now a ferocious
shark-like monster.  He chomps the boat and the gold
branches slide into the water.  Madmartigan bashes the
monster with the oar, then grabs an anchor.  The mon-
ster attacks again and Madmartigan jabs its gill with
the anchor.

The monster sinks into the lake.  They all sigh with
relief.  Madmartigan shrugs proudly.  Suddenly the an-
chor line unravels, tangling Madmartigan's legs in
fishing nets and yanking him overboard.

Underwater, Madmartigan swirls behind the monster.  He
pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts
himself free with his dagger.

He surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat.
Willow reaches out to him.  The monster surfaces and
circles the boat.  Then it attacks Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!  Help!!  Willow!!!

Willow digs out a magic acorn.  But he drops it!  He
fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it.  The
monster opens its jaws and goes to devour Madmartigan.
Willow throws the acorn.

The monster miraculously turns to stone.  Madmartigan
grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster
sinks.  Willow hauls him into the boat.

EXT. LAKESHORE - DAY

The storm begins to die down as they jump to shore, ex-
hausted.  Madmartigan wears nothing now but a ragged
loincloth.  He falls to his knees, coughing and spit-
ting.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...you...you got...magic...!
          Wait...we could team up...!

He pulls himself up and follows Willow.  Suddenly they
all stop.  Sorsha and her men come out of the woods.

                        RAZIEL
          Flee!  Flee!

The brownies scurry into a hole.  Raziel makes a dash
for it but a soldier skewers her tail with his spear,
dangling her in front of Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Raziel.  Did you think my mother
          would allow you to escape?

Sorsha gestures, and the soldier takes Raziel away.
The lieutenant wrestles the baby away from Willow.  He
gives her to Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          This is what we're looking for.  It
          bears the markings.

Willow panics.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  If there's
          one thing I'm good at, it's charm-
          ing a woman...

He swaggers forward.  Sorsha turns and looks at him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So.  Couldn't live without me, huh?

Sorsha looks up and down at his naked body.

                        SORSHA
          Lose your skirt?  How embarassing.

Madmartigan looks down and adjusts his loincloth.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Still got what counts.

A pause as he smiles at her.

                        SORSHA
          Not for long.

She raises her fist and zap:  Madmartigan is instantly
surrounded by spears and swords.

                        SORSHA
          We'll join the column.  Bring them
          with us.

Madmartigan and Willow are roughly taken away.  Sorsha
and her troops mount horses and ride off.  Rool and
Teemo crawl lup from under a rock.

                         TEEMO
          We gotta follow them.

                         ROOL
          Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any-
          way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's
          go home.

Rool walks off and Teemo grabs him, yanks him back.

                         TEEMO
          Get back here, Rool!

                         ROOL
          Ouch!  Let go of me!

Rool throws a punch, and the brownies somersault into
the bushes fighting each other.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Sorsha and her men now ride with a caravan of fifty
NOCKMAAR TROOPS.  Chained by their necks.  Willow and
Madmartigan walk behind a wagon.  Raziel sits trapped
in a cage on the back of the wagon.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go on...

Willow loses strength, falls and is dragged.  Madmarti-
gan picks him up and carries him on his shoulders.
Sorsha sees this.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, why don't you use your mag-
          ic to get us out of here?

                        RAZIEL
          He's no magician.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He turned that monster into stone!

Raziel peers sternly at Willow, who is eye-level with
her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Did *you* give that acorn its power?

                        WILLOW
          No.

                        RAZIEL
          A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool
          can use it.

Madmartigan shakes his head at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Then you get us out of here.

                        RAZIEL
          I will!  But I need help!

                        WILLOW
          I'll help you...!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I won't.

                        RAZIEL
          You must learn magic.

                        WILLOW
          That's all I ever wanted!

                        RAZIEL
          Then I will teach you.

Sorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan, carrying
the baby, who is crying.  Madmartigan, with Willow
still on his shoulders, straightens up and flirts with
her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nice horse...nice hair...real nice
          hair...I'd say you've got the most
          beautiful hair I've ever--

She flashes her eyes at him.

                        SORSHA
          Wolff wants to boil you in oil.

She nods toward her Lieutenant, who snarls viciously.

                        SORSHA
          Don't tempt me.

She turns away.  The baby squirms and cries.

                        WILLOW
          If you rest the baby on your
          shoulder, she'll stop crying.

                        SORSHA
          Shut up.

Sorsha rides along.  She shifts the baby to her other
shoulder, and she instantly stops crying.  Sorsha
throws a look at Willow.  Madmartigan takes a long deep
breath.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.

                        SORSHA
                    (angry threat)
          My step-father's going to tear you
          apart.

Madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm torn apart already.  I mean it!
          Under all that armor is a 
          beautiful--

CRACK!  Sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Who is that girl, anyway?

                        RAZIEL
          Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

Madmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Forget that one, Madmartigan.

Raziel leaps against the bars of her cage, chatters her
teeth and whispers to Willow.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow.  To learn magic, first you 
          must make your own philosopher's
          stone!

                        WILLOW
          What do I need for that?

                        RAZIEL
          We must start with feathers, dung,
          and a lock of your hair.

Willow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his
eyes and frowns at it.  Madmartigan, meanwhile, can't
take his eyes off Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now that's a woman...!

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Fires and torches burn around pitched tents.  Soldiers
eat and drink, and meat is thrown out to Death Dogs.
From her cage, Raziel looks down at Willow, still
chained to the wagon next to Madmartigan.  Willow is
grinding a substance with a rock.

                        RAZIEL
          Keep working at it.  Forget all you
          know, or think you know.  A
          magician's power depends on disord-
          er of the mind.

She twists her head through the bars.  Madmartigan
squints up at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You got that one covered.

Willow hears the baby crying in a distant tent.

                        WILLOW
          I hope she's all right.  How much
          more do I have to do of this?

                        RAZIEL
          Till it's in a powder.  The energy
          exits within you...

                        WILLOW
                      (reciting)
          I know, and the magician's goal is
          to find his true self.  But what's
          this got to do with it?

                        RAZIEL
          As below, so above.  You hold the
          univers, Willow, in your hand.

Madmartigan clasps his forhead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm beginning to think you two
          *deserve* to be locked up.

                        WILLOW
          The universe is a living creature,
          like you and me, Madmartigan.

Madmartigan cynically gazes at the sky, gesturing wide-
ly.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're a tiny version of all that?

                        RAZIEL
          As above, so below.

Madmartigan rolls his eyes.  Willow jumps to his feet
and shows Raziel the substance.

                        WILLOW
          I'm all finished.  Now what?

                        RAZIEL
          Burn it to a fine ash.

Willow looks around.  Heavily armed Nockmaar minions
rip chunks of meat around a campfire.

                        WILLOW
          How am I gonna do that?

                        RAZIEL
          Patience.  Concentrate.  You will
          find a way.

Suddenly bootsteps clomp toward them.  Willow quickly
folds the powder inside some cloth and hides it in his
pocket.  The Lieutenant marches up and scrutinizes them
suspiciously.  He abruptly snatches Willow up, hacks
the chain and drags him off.

                        WILLOW
          What's going on?

Madmartigan sturggles against his chains.  Angry and
worried:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurt him and you'll answer to me!

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - NIGHT

The Lieutenant clamps irons on Willow's wrists, flings
him into a tent and exits.  Willow looks up and sees
Sorsha, still in her uniform, impatiently pacing wiht
the crying baby.

                        SORSHA
          This baby won't do what I say.  You
          seem to know what to do.  Here!
          Make it shut up.

Sorsha dumps the baby in Willow's arms and then backs
away.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed.

                        SORSHA
          I changed her already!

Willow politely shrugs.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed again.
Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow
changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re-
lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror.
Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the
fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

                        SORSHA
          Who is that horrible friend of
          yours?

                        WILLOW
                  (watching the fire)
          Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Who is he?

                        WILLOW
          I don't know much about him.

Sorsha fiddles with her long red hair.  Willow creeps
toward the fire.

                        SORSHA
          He's very bold.  Do you really
          think my hair is beautiful?

She turns and looks right at Willow.  He looks back.
She asks the question again by holding out strands of
her hair.

                        WILLOW
          Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair.

He suddenly strides over to Sorsha.

                        WILLOW
          She's hungry.

                        SORSHA
          I know she's hungry.  I tried to
          feed her but she wouldn't eat a
          thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

                        WILLOW
          Here.  Hold her.

He hands Sorsha the baby, then goes to the fire where
there's a stone crock of milk.  He carefully takes his
cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it.  At the
other side of the tent Sorsha awkwardly paces with the
baby.

                        SORSHA
          I tried everything.  A spoon.  I
          poured milk into her mouth, she just
          spat it out.  I don't know what to
          do, I'm not a mother.

During this, Willow ignites his powdery substance.  It
flares slightly then burns to an ash.  He gathers it
up, then returns to Sorsha with the milk.

                        WILLOW
          Sometimes she likes it heated.

Willow finds a strip of cloth, dips it in the milk, and
feeds Elora Danan in Sorsha's arms.  He looks up at
Sorsha and smiles.

                        WILLOW
          She's a good baby.

Sorsha looks down at the baby.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - MORNING

The caravan packs up to move on.  Soldiers drag Willow
to the wagon and lift him on board, chaining him beside
Raziel's cage.  Willow excitedly pats his pocker, and
whispers:

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  I got the ashes!

When the soldiers leave, he digs out the pouch and
proudly shows it to Raziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Good!  The first step is complete.

Chained behind the wagon, Madmartigan reaches forward
and pokes Willow with his finger?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Did she ask about me?

                        WILLOW
          Who?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard
          time.  You were in her ten all
          night.  Did she say anything?

Willow deliberately plays innocent.

                        WILLOW
          She said lots of thing.s

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!

Willow grins.  At last:

                        WILLOW
          She asked about you, Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Well what did she say?

Suddenly Sorsha gallops by on horseback, holding the
baby.  She flings a wad of clothes at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Here.  You're going to need these
          where we're going.

She rides off.  Madmartigan looks down at the clothes.
The looks at Willow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's in love.

                        WILLOW
          You're crazy.  I think you're in
          love.

EXT. SNOW MOUNTAIN - DAY

The Nockmaar caravan climbs into snow-covered moun-
tains.  In the wagon, Raziel is grilling Willow.  He
concentrates hard, cramming, memorizing, straining.

                        RAZIEL
          We don't have much time left!  Go
          on!  Go on!

                        WILLOW
          I must concetrate my
          imagination...to creat a
          new...reality!

                        RAZIEL
          What's the magician's weapon?

                        WILLOW
          The limitless power of...

Raziel flips around in spasms of impatience.

                        RAZIEL
          Your will!  Your will!  What else
          could it be?

                        WILLOW
                     (frustrated)
          I can't remember all these things.
          What am I learning?

                        RAZIEL
          The art of transformation!


                        WILLOW
                     (exasperated)
          But what am I gonna transform??

                        RAZIEL
          Me!

Willow and Madmartigan stare at Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You?

                     MADMARTIGAN
          What are you gonna become, Raziel?
          Queen of the rodents?

Sorsha rides up to the wagon.

                        SORSHA
          The baby's cold.  Take her.

She dismounts.  With care, keeping the baby bundled,
she hands the baby to Willow.  Madmartigan watches and
listens.

                        RAZIEL
          You remind me of your father, Sor-
          sha.

                        SORSHA
          My father was a weakling.

                        RAZIEL
          He was a great king.
                 (Madmartigan reacts)
          Not like your step-father, not like
          your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen
          with kindness, and a generous
          heart.

                        SORSHA
          My mother calls that weakness.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What do *you* call it?

Sorsha turns and glares at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I do what I'm told.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Too bad you're not more like
          your father.

She looks at him a moment, then abruptly mounts her
horse and rides ahead.

EXT. ROAD TOWARD SNOW CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

The caravan rides toward a large Nockmaar camp.  Death
Dogs howl and fires burn ominously in the distance.
Willow and madmartigan watch as KING KAEL rides out to
meet the caravan.

Kael is huge, powerful and cruel, partbeast, part man,
and he carries a terrible sword at his side.  Sorsha
carefully shows him the baby.  He grabs it from her.

                        SORSHA
          Be careful.

                         KAEL
          Don't tell me what to do.

Kael viciously hits Sorsha, knocking her off her horse.
Madmartgian and Willow watch angrily.  Kail gallops to-
ward camp with the baby under his ar.  Sorsha shakes
away the pain and, humiliated, mounts her horse.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We gotta get the baby out of here.

Raziel dashes around her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Tonight!  Complete the
          philosopher's stone!  I must be
          turned back!

Looking off into the camp, angry and resolute, Willow
takes out the ingredients for the stone.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it, Raziel...

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT

Now in a kind of portable cell, Madmartigan clutches
the jail bars and looks out at the camp.  Fires and
torches burn, and Nockmaar soldiers patrol.

Shivering cold, willow sits cross-legged in the jail,
melting snow into a bowl.  On a nearby lean-to, where
skins and shields are kept, Raziel hangs in her cage.

Somewhere the baby is crying.  In the distance Sorsha
goes inside one of the tenst. There's a muffled yel-
ling between Sorsha and Kael.  Then Keal storms out of
the tent and goes inside the tent next door.

Willow pours the ashes into the melted snow.

                        RAZIEL
          Let it settle.  Carefully, slowly.
          Concentration and will.  Now pour
          the water off.

As Willow works, Madmartigan binds together scrap
sticks of wood, making a long pole.  He gingerly hooks
Raziel's cage with this, lifting it from the spike.

                        WILLOW
          Oooh, this smells terrible.

                        RAZIEL
          That's the life spark.  Exxence of
          magic and sorcery!

Madmartigan angles the pole and the cage slide toard
him.  He grabs it with both hands and rips it apart.
Raziel right away scurries down the cell bars, jumps
into the jail and bits Willow's hand.

                        WILLOW
          Ouch!!

                        RAZIEL
          Shhhhh!

They look out nervously at patrolling Nockmaar sol-
diers.  Willow sucks the back of his hand.

                        WILLOW
          What'd you bit me for!!

                        RAZIEL
          We need blood.  To nourish the
          stone.  charge the stone with ener-
          gy.

Willow drips his blood into the concoction then stirs
it with a twig.  It begins to glow from within.

                        RAZIEL
          The components of the stone are
          fusing...

Willow's eyes widen with anticipation.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT - LATER

Fires have burned down.  Most of the camp is sleeping.
It is nearing dawn.  Madmartigan stares out at Sorsha's
tent, deep in thought.  Willow holds up the completed
PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, a red ball of pliable putty.

                        RAZIEL
          Again:  what is the magician's
          weapon?

                        WILLOW
          His will.

                        RAZIEL
          Now use it.

Willow presses the philopher's stone against the
chainlock.  He sheepishly looks over his hsoulder at
Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I just wanted to test it first.

                        RAZIEL
          No!  Change me back into a sor-
          ceress, Willow.

Willow goes to Raziel and concentrates with physical
and mental intensity.

                        WILLOW
          Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...

It starts to work.  Raziel curls into a ball of fur.
The fur changes to feathers.  She begins to squawk
strangely.  She emerges as a raven-sized bird.

                        WILLOW
          What did I do?

He sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered
hands.  Then: CLINK!  The lock falls open.  They all
look over, and Madmartigan picks it up off the ground.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You
          busted the lock.

Wilow clutches Madmartigan's arm.  He holds up the
stone.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get
          Eloran Danan.

With coldness in his eyes, madmartigan stares across
the camp at Sorsha's tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Let's get Elora Danan.

They sneak away.

                        RAZIEL
          Wait!  What about me!

Raziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky.

EXT. THROUGH THE CAMP - DAWN

Willow and Madmartigan sneak behind tents, hiding from
the patrolling guards.  Very quietly they creep up to
Kael's tent.  Madmartigan knocks out a guard and steals
his knife.  They crawl dangerously over to Sorsha's
tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm
          a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the
          baby.

Madmartigan slits the back of the tent open and slips
inside.  Raziel flutters down and lands on Willow's
shoulder.

                        RAZIEL
          I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo=
          man.

Willow shrugs apologetically.

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - DAWN

Crouched inside the large tent, Madmartigan calculates
his next move.  In the far corner, Sorsha lies asleep.
He steals the baby from a crib of straw.  Starts to
leave.  But stops.  Willow pokes his head inside.

                        WILLOW
                      (whispers)
          Come on, Madmartigan...!

Madmartigan stares over at Sorsha.  Lured by her beau-
ty, he slowly walks toward her bed.

                        WILLOW
          What are you doing?  Get out of
          there...!

Madmartigan looks down at her.  Morning rushlight il-
luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is
spread across her pillow.  Out of her armor, in soft
nightclothes, she looks like a goddess.  Upon her
breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels.
Quietly:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I love you.

He kisses her lips.  Her eyes open.

                        SORSHA
          One move, and you really will be a
          woman.

Holding the baby, Madmartigan does not move a muscle.
Sorsha holds a knife at his crotch.

                        SORSHA
          You're a fool.  Now put her back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm not going to let this baby die.

Sorsha presses the knife.

                        SORSHA
          Don't make me kill you.

Willow watches as Madmartigna carefully backs away from
Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I believe you would...

Sitting up, Sorsha waves her knife.  Madmartigan places
the baby in the straw crib.

                        SORSHA
          Why did you say that?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Say what?

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Madmartigan walks back to Sorsha' bed.  Willow crawls
into the tent, behind Madmartigan's back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Because it's true.

                        SORSHA
          I don't believe you.

Sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as Madmartigan
walks toward her.  He shows no fear of her knife, com-
pelled instead by honest passion.  For once, he isn't
conning anybody.  His feelings are genuine.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I wish it weren't true.  I swore
          I'd never let this happen.  I hate
          you.  I hate your beauty, I hate
          your innocence, I hate the feelings
          you've awakened in me.

The knife trembles in Sorsha's hand.

                       MADMARTIGAN
          I'm in love with you, Sorsha.  I
          don't want to be, but a power has
          enchanted me and I stand helpless
          against it.  It's torture.  Battle-
          field or prison cell was never half
          as cruel.

He kneels onto her bed.  Her hand falls, her knife
falls to the floor, her chest heaves with fear and emo-
tion.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I want you and I can't have you so
          I want you all the more.  If this
          were another time and another place
          I'd--

He stops.  He looks into her eyes.  Willow dashes out of
the tent with the baby.

                        SORSHA
          You'd what?

Madmartigan takes Sorsha in his arms and kisses her.
Her trembling body surrenders to him.  Until:

They hear a SCREAM outside the tent.  It all happens
quickly.  Kael rips open the canvas and catches them in
their embrace.  In one hand he holds the baby.  In the
other hand:  Willow.

                         KAEL
          What's going on here!!

Sorsha sees the baby, sees the empty crib, and smashes
Madmartigan hard across the face.

                        SORSHA
          Deceiver!!

Kael hurls Willow across the tent and tosses the baby
in the straw.  Growling horribly he lunges at Madmarti-
gan.  Madmartigan rolls away and sees Sorsha's sword
nearby.  Grabs it.  As Kael draws his sword, Madmarti-
gan artfully slices away the center pole, and the en-
tie tent collapses.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - MORNING

Bodies writhe under the fallen mass of canvas, and Ra-
ziel hovers and screeches above.  Then, a silver blade
slits through the tent, and out jumps Madmartigan
wielding Sorsha's sword.

Alarm!  Nockmaar soldiers and Death Dogs charge across
the snow.  Madmartigan battles them with incredible
skill, backing toward the mountain slope.

Wilow crawls out from under the corner of the tent,
clutchign the baby.  Madmartigan kills several so-
diers, littering the snow with bodies and weapons.
Willow reacts, impressed by Madmartigan's swordsman-
ship.  Madmartigan makes the mistake of acknowledging
it:  he bows, prod and cocky.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whoops!

He slips on the ice and catches himself.  Nearby a
shield skids off along the snow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Jump on the shiled!

Kael howls and thrashes inside the collapsed tent.
Then he gashes it open with his huge black sword.  He
sees Willow and the baby get on the large shield.

                         KAEL
          Bowmen!  Horses!  After them!

Madmartigan runs toward the shield.  Archers draw their
bows.  Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha beside Kael.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  I didn't betray you.  I
          love you!

As arrows rain down around him, Madmartigan leaps onto
the shield behind Wuillow.  Sorsha watches them as they
slide away down the mountain, Raziel flapping and
shrieking overhead.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!!

Kael waves his sward and a crack squad of Nockmaar
HORSEMEN gallop down the mountain after the sled-
shield.

EXT. DOWN THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN - DAY

Willow hugs the baby while he sits between
Madmartigan's legs, and the shield zooms down the moun-
tain, zig-zagging through trees.  Madmartigan steers by
using Sorsha's sword as a ski pole.

The Nockmaar horsemen gallop after them.

The shield skips and flies over snowdrifts and bumps.
Raziel squawks in terror above them.  Just missing
trees and rocks, they pick up speek.  Their eyes sud-
denly widen.  Dead ahead is a huge wall of ice!

                        WILLOW
          Nooo!!!

Willow shuts his eyes.  the shield speeds toward the
wall.  At the last moment Madmartigan steers them into
a small opening, little more than a crack.  Raziel,
nearly smashing into the wall herself, soars up into
the sky and loses them.

INT. ICE TUNNEL - DAY

They slide and sway down a long tube of ice, picking up
incredible speed until they loop 360 degrees upside-
down and around and go shooting out a hole at the other
end.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

They soar thorugh the air.  Madmartigan and Willow
shriek in terror.  But Elora Danan giggles:  she's hav-
ing fun!  But in the air the shield goes one way and
they go another, flipping and hanging onto one another
and landing on soft snow with a fffump.  Inertia keeps
them rolling.

Clumped together, they tumble down the mountain, gath-
ering snaw as they go, bouncing and rolling into a
snowball that gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger!

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The snowball steamrolls toward a small village at the
foot of the mountain.  CHLDREN look up and squeal with
delight while the adult VILLAGERS run for their lives.

It plows through the middle of the village, scattering
peole and animals left and right.  At last it smashes
against a stone house and cracks open like an egg.

Raziel flies down and lands on top of the snowball,
flapping her wings frantically.  madmartigan crawls out
as the villagers rush up.  They stand back in amaze-
ment:  the baby starts crying.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!  Are you all
          right?

Madmartigan drags Willow and the baby out of the snow.
Willow's body is limp, he's unconscious.  Then a VIL-
LAGER points up at the mountain.

                       VILLAGER
          King Kael!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Nockmaar troops!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                    (to villagers)
          Help us.

In the distance Kael and his squad of about 15 horsemen
charge toward the village.  The villagers flee into
their huts and houses.  Madmartigan scoops up Willow
and the baby.  Some villagers usher them around a
corner and into a house just as Kael's army invades the
town.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Madmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar
into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts
behind him.  MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle here in
silence, like refugees or criminals.  Madmartigan hands
the crying baby to a WOMAN then lays Willow on the
floor.  Suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder:  his
old friend and rival Airk Thaughbaer.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan.  Settled down with a
          family huh?

Madmartigan knocks Airk's hand away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You left me to die, friend.

                         AIRK
          You managed alright.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Is this what's left of your army?

Among the refugees is a handful of war-battered WARRI-
ORS.  One of them, an OFFICER looks out through the
ceiling beams.

                        OFFICER
          Keep that baby quiet.

They hear hoofbeats outside.  Airk gives Madmartigan a
flask of whiskey.  He squirts whiskey into Willow's
mouth and Willow coughs and shudders awake.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Raziel flies onto a rooftop and looks down.  Nockmaar
soldiers flood the village, dismounting, kicking down
doors, searching houses.  Then Raziel sees Kael riding
alongside Sorsha.

In her armor, at a distance, Sorsha looks fierce.  But
CLOSER her eyes show confusion, hesitation.  Kael
watches her closely as he waves his sword at the vil-
lage.

                         KAEL
          Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn
          your village!  Sorsha!

He shakes her roughly.  She dismounts.  Raziel watches
as Sorsha and two other soldiers enter the house where
Madmartigan and Willow are hiding.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Willow holds the baby tight.  Madmartigan, Airk and the
Officer watch through the cracks.  Boots pound above,
shaking dust down on them.  A door opens.

Nobody breathes.  Willow buries the baby in his chest.
Madmartigan peeks through the door.  Sorsha, alone,
comes down into the cellar.  They see her.  Searching.
Airk's men reach for their swords, begin to draw.
Whisper:

                        OFFICER
          Kill her.

Madmartigam shakes his head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You'll draw the others.

Airk looks at Madmartigan curiously.  Madmartigan
watches Sorsha. She is right there, inches away.
Inaudibly, be says her name.  At last she goes back
upstairs.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Sorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two
soldiers.

INT. CELLAR

In Willow's arms, the baby lets out a cry.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS

Sorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords.  The
baby's cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud SDRRECH.
Raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around
the house, cawing and shrieking insanely.  Sorsha and
the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave.

INT. CELLAR

Everyone sighs with relief.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

In the distance the Nockmaar army is setting houses ab-
laze and Kael is terrorizing the fleeing people with
his sword.  Sorsha mounts her horse.  Her attention is
momemtarily caught by a MAN across the street who, from
the back, looks like Madmartigan.  She gasps.  The man
turns around.  She sags with disappointment, spurs her
horse, and rides off.

The deadly squad of Nockmaar horsemen gallops out of
the village.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Madmartigan and Willow come upstairs with Airk and his
men.

                         AIRK
          It's you they're after, Madmarti-
          gan.  What did you do this time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          They're not after me.  They want
          the baby.

Living in the house is a scrawny, shifty-eyed man named
CUTH.  He watches and listens.

                         AIRK
          Who is this baby?

Willow steps forward, both protective and proud.

                        WILLOW
          The princess, Elora Danan.

They all know of her.  They all sigh with respeck and
awe, and they bow.

                        PEOPLE
          The prophecy has come true.

                         AIRK
          Give her to us.  We'll protect her.

Raziel screeches from a ceiling beam.

                        RAZIEL
          Not safe!  Not safe!

Willow looks up at Raziel hopefully.

                        WILLOW
          We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
          She'll be safe there from
          Bavmorda's powers.

Airk looks up at Raziel.  Then down at Willow.  He
clasps Madmartigan's arm.

                         AIRK
          Tir Asleen is a myth.  It doesn't
          exist.

                        RAZIEL
          It does!  It does!  I will show
          you!

Airk impatiently waves the bird away and shoves Madmar-
tigan in the chest.

                         AIRK
          You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
          I've lost half my men fighting
          Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-
          maar army.  Now you and this Peck,
          and that magpie up in the rafters,
          are gonna take 'em on alone?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (challenging)
          Then come with us.

Airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor.

                         AIRK
          The war is here!  In towns and vil-
          lages like this!

Airk crosses his arms and turns his back, looking out
at the burning houses and the suffering families.

                         AIRK
          You're chasing a dream.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Just get me some horses.

Airk glares at him furiously.  Then he kicks open the
door and storms out into the street.  Madmartigan and
Willow hurry after him.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Airk and his men, plus some villagers, watch as Madmar-
tigan mounts a large horse.  Then some villagers help
Willow wiggle up onto a small pony.  They sling the
baby over Willow's back and stuff saddlebags with pro-
visions

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Once again, Airk, we say goodbye.

Sadly and cynically, Airk laughs.

                         AIRK
          One day one of us willl stand on
          the other's grave.

They shake hands ruggedly.  Madmartigan nods at Willow
and they head off.  Airk watches them go, clearly am-
bivalent about staying behind.  They ride up the snowy
slope, Raziel circling above.

WE SEE Cuth.  He scratches his filthy beard.  He sneaks
off through the village, in the direction of the Nock-
maar army.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

Snow circles around them as they climb.  Then, oddly,
the mountain becomes warmer, and the snow melts away.
They reach a slope of dark vitreous lava.

                        RAZIEL
          Nockmaar!  Nockmaar!

Far away, at the top of the mountain, looms the ominous
Catsle of Nockmaar.  The black lava flows from it
like a deadly shadow.

EXT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Their horses rear up as they approach the mouth of the
cave.  Raziel waits for them, circling and cawing.

                        RAZIEL
          This way!  The cave!

They dismount and lead the horses.  But the horses pan-
ic, their frightened neighing voices echoing deep in
the gloomy cave, and they break away and run off.

Willow swallows hard.  He and Madmartigan follow Raziel
inside.

INT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten
lava.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  I can't stand being
          in closed-in places.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Want me to carry Elora?

                        WILLOW
          I'm used to her.  How's she doing?

Willow wears the papoose on his back.  Madmartigan
looks in at the baby's face.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's doing a lot better than we
          are, Peck.

Willow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension.
Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat
screeches somewhere and the tension's back.  They keep
going.

INT. DEEPER IN THE CAVE

Hot liquid drips from the ceiling.  Hissing steam bub-
bles from the floor.  they go single-file along a ledge
over a foaming lava pit.  Raziel is squawking way ahead
in the distance.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...this may be a bad time to
          ask this question but...what if
          Raziel's wrong?

                        WILLOW
          She can't be wrong.  She's a very
          very very powerful sorceress.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's a bird, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          That's my fault, not hers.  I've
          got to keep practicing.  I'm still
          in the learning stage but magic,
          Madmartigan, requires concentration
          and--

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Watch it!

                        WILLOW
          Ahhh!

Madmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about
to fall into the lava pit.  He hauls him to safety.
They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the
cave.  They stop.  They hear something.  Something
strange.

Then, something moves on the wall.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

The cave walls come to life.  Down them crawl ugly ROCK
PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly
like bats.  Madmartigan fights them off with his sword.
The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their
size.  Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an
untied balloon.

Suddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.  Madmar-
tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de-
fend Willow and the baby against the army.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Go, Willow!  Run!  Run!

Willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder.
At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.  Mad-
martigan waits.

The Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come
charging down the cave.  Kael rides in the lead along-
side the turncoat Cuth.  As they gallop along the
ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an-
grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit.

The army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode
underfoot.  Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede
toward him.  But suddenly the horseman all screech
thir horses to a halt.  The horses rear and back away.

Madmartigan stands there, wondering.  Then suddenly a
shadow looms behind him.  He turns.

The EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders.
It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like
visitors.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!

He looks around frantically.  Willow is nowhere to be
seen.  Then the baby cries out.  Madmartigan sees them,
cowering behind a rock.  He runs toward them.  The
Eborsisk exhales flames over his head.

                         KAEL
          Go after them!

Soldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.  He fights
them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in-
cinerated by the Eborsisk.  Sorsha's horse rears as she
watches Madmartigan battle for his life.  Archers shoot
arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an-
grier.

Willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket.
A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.  Madmar-
tigan looks to Willow for help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurry, Willow!  Throw it!

Willow winds up and throws with all his might.  The
Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck-
ing his aim.  Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks
as the acorn whistles by his ear.  The acorn bounces
off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground
and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.  The
soldier's body turns to stone.

                        RAZIEL
          Look out!

One of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby.
Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's
eye as Willow whisks the baby away.

Then Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.  He climbs
up over its flaming head and drives his sword down
through its skull.  The Eborsisk howls horribly and its
wounded head falls.  Madmartigan topples down its back
and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all
in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby
up onto the back of the horse and galloping away.

                         KAEL
          After them!!

But as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls
to its knees, half-dead.  The surviving head blasts the
soldiers with fire.  They rear back on their horses and
continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears.

EXT. CAVE - TIR ASLEEN - DAY

They ride out of the mouth of the dark cave into a lush
valley of flowers.  In the distance stands the beau-
tiful CASTLE OF TIR ASLEEN.  Raziel zooms up out of the
cave an flies above them as they gallop fullspeed to-
ward it.  She soars higher and higher and flies right
over the castle wall.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN CASTLE - DAY

The door of the castle is half open.  Madmartigan and
Willow gallop inside.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the
castle courtyard.  A haunting wind drones amont TWELVE
PILLARS which look like stone from a distance.

                        RAZIEL
          Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          There's nobody here.

They approach the twelve pillars.

                        RAZIEL
          The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The
          king's bravest warriors.

Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Kael and his army charge out of the cave and trample
across the valley of flowers.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to
shut it.

                        RAZIEL
          Turn them back, Willow!

Willow stares at the twelve knights.

                        WILLOW
          How??

                        RAZIEL
          Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur-
          ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

The castle door is rusted and old.  madmartigan heaves
against it.  Outside he can see the army storming to-
ward him.

Willow digs out his philosopher's stone.  He squints
and strains, concentrating his energy.

                        WILLOW
          Beings within, beings without!
          Danu danu walkail funfawtha!

He continues to chant and to concentrate.  One of the
knights comes to life.

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here!
          Look!  You gotta see this!  I did
          it!

                        RAZIEL
          More!  More!

Madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army
charges up, and he locks it with a huge bolt.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen rear back form the locked door.

                         KAEL
          Assault!  Scale the walls!

He sends his men in all directions.  They leap off
their horses and hack down trees from the nearby woods.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow brings the knights to life, one by one.

                        WILLOW
          Tuatha tuatha danu!

Each knight shakes himself into action.  Madmartigan
follows them in an armory.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!  I transformed them all!
          I'm a magician!

                        RAZIEL
          You didn't transform them, Willow,
          you released them.  That was noth-
          ing.  Now change me.

Willow's on a roll.  He rubs his hands together.

                        WILLOW
          I feel like I could do anything!

He drops to his knees and stretches his philosopher's
stone apart like an accordian.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - ARMORY

Madmartigan and the knights grab weapons and armor.
Two knights wheel a catapult out ot the battlements.
Madmartigan wees, displayed specially on a rack, a com-
plete set of armor of shining silver.  He reaches out
to touch it.

                        KNIGHT
          It belonged to our king.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

The knights light a fire and boil vats of oil.  Willow
struggles to transform Raziel, trying to remember all
he has learned.

                        WILLOW
          Capture the enery...limitless
          power of the will...avvdachh doth
          indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!

Raziel begins to change.  From a bird, she expands,
stretches, and turns into a GOAT.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What
          happened?

Raziel tilts her goat head.

                        RAZIEL
          I hate this.

Suddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall.
Willow scoops up the baby and he and Raziel run for cover.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

From their horses Kael and Sorsha watch as the soldiers
climb the wall.  They suddenly hear a hacking noise
above and several Nockmaar men tumble down the ladders.
Sorsha looks up.

High on the wall stands Madmartigan, magnificently
dressed in the glimmering armor of the King!

Kael roars and points his deadly sword up at Madmarti-
gan.  Then several soldiers attack the castle door with
a huge battering ram and smash it open.

                         KAEL
          Attack!!

Kael and Sorsha gallop into the castle with otehr Nock-
maar horsemen, while Madmartigan continues to battle
attackers on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court-
yeard.  He makes a run for the hallway.  SIX HORSEMEN
chase after him, jumping off their horses and drawing
their swords.

Sorsha dismounts, draws a sword, and strides up the
stairs toward teh top of the wall.

INT. ARMORY

Willow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a
corner.  The six horsement run in and corner him.  He
grabs an enormous broadsword.  Swings it like a base-
ball bat.  The momentum of the heavy sword hurls Willow
across the room.  The blade pierces a Nockmaar man.
Willow grunts and yanks the sword out.  The remaining
soldiers come after him.  Willow swings and flashes the
sword as they close in on him.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

In the courtyard, Raziel the goat butts a few soldiers
as the battle rages.

UP ON THE WALL

Madmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down
the wall.  Then he turns around.  Five more enemy
swordsmen slash at him.  Madmartigan is amazing:  spin-
nig, lunging, ducking, he takes out one, two, three,
four of them with ease.  But not the fifth.

It's the Nockmaar Lieutenant.  He and Madmartigan
swordfight.  The Lieutenant hacks the sword out of
Madmartigan's hand: it clatters down into the court-
yeard.

Madmartigan throws up his arm.  The Lieutenant's sword
clangs against his wrist armor, knocking Madmartigan
onto his back.  With two hands the Lieutenant lifts his
sword high and goes to kill Madmartigan.  madmartigan
shuts his eyes.  But nothing happens.

Madmartigan opens his eyes.  the Lieutenant stands
there, frozen, staring at him.  Then falls forward.
Rolls over Madmartigan.  And plummets off teh wall.  In
his place stands Sorsha, holding a bloodied sword.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Madmartigan.

He props himself up on his elbows and smiles.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whose side are you on?

She reaches down and pulls Madmartigan to his feet.

                        SORSHA
          Yours.

They look into each other's eyes.  They go to embrace.

                        MINION
          Arrrggghhh!

Out of nowhere a Nockmaar minion attacks them, his
sword flashing over his head. Sorhsa hardly moves.
She simply dusts him off the wall with her sword.  She
turns back to Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Their armor clanks as they throw their arms around each
other and kiss, high up on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

Kael looks up from his horse.

                         KAEL
          Sorsha!!

He sees Sorsha and Madmartigan coming down the wall,
fighting Nockmaar troops.  Kael holds up his great
hand.  In it he holds the baby.

                         KAEL
          Bordak!

Kael waves his men after Sorsha and Madmartigan.

                         KAEL
          Kill them both!

He laughs viciously then gallops toward the castle
door.  As he reaches it he abruptly stops.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Two hundred HORSEMEN are charging straight toward Kael.
Led by Airk Thaughbaer!

CLOSER, riding in Airk's saddlebags, with their tiny
daggers flashing, are the long-lost brownies, Teemo and
Rool!

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael stuffs the baby deep inside his tunic.

                         KAEL
          Troops!  To Nockmaar!  Ride with
          me!

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan and Sorsha mount horses.  Willow staggers
out of the armory, wounded and bleeding.

                        WILLOW
          I'm sorry.  There were too many of
          them.

Madmartigan scoops him up.  With seven surviving
knights, they ride out.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Many of Kael's men fall in battle.  But Kael and a
dozen horsemen plow through and escape into the cave.

Madmartigan rides up to Airk Thaughbaer and their
horses powerfully dance around each other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Out for a little ride in the coun-
          try, Airk?

                         AIRK
          Thought you might get lonely, Mad-
          martigan!

Then they drop the bravado and clasp hands.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Thank you, friend.

                         AIRK
          Let's go.

They charge into the cave.  The clamor of their
hoofbeats echoes and then fades to silence.  The valley
is littered with fallen soldiers.

Then, Raziel trots out of the castle.  She clip-clops
across the valley and follows the others to the cave.

EXT. VOLCANIC MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen race out of the cave and gallop
up the obsidian mountain toward the dark castle.

The army of Tir Asleen thunders out of the cave in pur-
suit.

Arrows fire back and forth.  The Tir Asleen army stays
right on the enemy's tail.  Willow hangs on to Madmar-
tigan for dear life.

Airk and Madmartigan ride side by side, perfect team-
work, and cut a few Nockmaar ment down.

Then Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha ride up past
everybody.  What a rider she is!  She surprises a cou-
ple of Nockmaar soldiers, swordfighting as she rides,
killing them both.  But she can't catche Kael.  He rides
ahead of everyone else, whipping his horse at an in-
credible speed toward the castle.

The chase continues up the mountain.  The Tir Asleen
army keeps firing arrows at the enemy, or cutting them
down with their swords, until only two Nockmaar men
ride behind Kael.  At last Kael reaches the castle
drawbridge and leaps onto it as it begins to rise.  His
two remaining horsemen leap after him but fall short
and tumble into the dry craggy moat.

The drawbridge shuts with a loud echoing KLUNGG!  Mad-
martigan and Arik screech to a halt on the brink of the
moat.  They look up.  The castle loom, huge, dark,
powerful, evil.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  Any way in there?

Sorsha rides up to his side.

                        SORSHA
          No.  The fortress is protected on
          all sides.

The Tir Asleen warriors, dwarfed by the huge black
wall, look at one another with doubt and worry.

                         AIRK
          Make camp!  We'll assault at dawn.

The army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies.  It
is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening.

INT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON

Kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up
the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.  He
comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing
fear.  Then creaks the door open.

INT. QUEEN'T TOWER

BAVMORDA looks up.  Kael cowers, afraid of her evil
power.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kael!

Carved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the
very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of
shining copper.  Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear-
ing black robes.  Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS.
Kael bows.

                         KAEL
          Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child.

The baby squirms and cries.  Seething with hate, Bav-
morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back.

                       BAVMORDA
          We must start the ritual!

She hears noise outside the castle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who is that?

                         KAEL
          An army of rebels and traitors.

Bavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels
the vibrations and energy around her.  Psychically:

                       BAVMORDA
          Where is Sorsha?

                         KAEL
          She has turned against you.

Bavmorda opens her eyes furiously.  to her druids:

                       BAVMORDA
          Purify the altar!  Arrange the im-
          plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha!

The druids take the baby from Kael.  Bavmorda storms
out the door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASLTE - DUSK

The Tir Asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires.
Then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the
castle wall.  Amid torches and hideous minions, Bavmor-
da leers down at them and laughs.

                       BAVMORDA
          This is not an army!

Sorsha looks up, and her mother seems to laugh right at
her.  Madmartigan steps forward.  Seeing him in the ar-
mor of the King, Bavmorda stops laughing, taken aback.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick!
          Hide!

Raziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent.

INT. TENT

Willlow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him.

                        RAZIEL
          Get down!  The ritual chant!
          Quick!  Protect yourself!

                        WILLOW
          Why?

                        RAZIEL
          Just do it!

Willow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to
chant.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE

Madmartigan faces the queen.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn
          her over to us!

Bavmorda stabs her finger down at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You dare to challenge me?  You are
          not warriors.  You're pigs!

She waves her hand, casting a horrible spell over the
army.  Madmartigan's body begins to change its shape.
His armor breaks apart.  He grows hideous.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're all pigs!

The rebel soldiers panic and run.  Slowly, horribly,
they all expand and contort, ripping out of their armor
and clothers, casting down their weapons and shields.

                        SORSHA
          Mother!  No!!

                       BAVMORDA
          You made your decision!

Bavmorda points at Sorsha, and Sorsha, too, begins to
change.  The mountainside becomes a sea of writhing
flesh.  Every one of the Tir Asleen army is transformed
into a pig.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DUSK Bavmorda throws open the
door.  Her druids are binding the baby in a leather
thong.

                       BAVMORDA
          Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the
          first candle.

A druid lights on of THIRTEEN ENORMOUS CANDLES.  Bav-
morda glares up at the roof.  In the middle of it is a
large circular hole showing the starlit sky.

                       BAVMORDA
          Come, thunder.  Come lightning.
          Touch this altar with your pwer.
          Come into my tower...

Lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the
distance.  Bavmorda smiles with satisfaction.

A druid places teh baby on the altar.  The other druid
hits a loud gong, once.  Bavmorda enters the Magician's
Circle.  Her face contorts as she recites:

                       BAVMORDA
          Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and
          bind, bind and blend, Universal
          night!  And the might of Nockmaar!

Magically she produces a razor-sharp knife.  Lightning
flashes again, getting closer.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow is crouched on his knees, chanting with her eyes
closed.

                        RAZIEL
          It's over, Willow.  You did well.
          You protected yourself.

Willow looks up.  He hears the grunting outside.  With
great trepidation, he crawls to the tent door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT

Willow shudders in horror at the grotesque sight.  Amid
horses and tents and weapons, hundreds of pigs wander
about.  Willow stands and walks through them.  He looks
down at one point and sees Rool and Teemo:  two tiny
baby pigs.  Then he turns and runs back into the tent.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow collapses to his knees beside Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I've come all this way and now
          Elora Dana's going to die!

                        RAZIEL
          No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!

                        WILLOW
          She's too powerful, Raziel

Raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof.

                        RAZIEL
          A true magician, Willow, never
          surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I
          am a sorceress!  Transform me now
          and I will destroy her!  Hexagram!

Willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around Ra-
ziel.  He steps outside of it, holds up his
philosopher's stone and begins his magic.

                        WILLOW
          Banish all disturbing forces from 
          this place.  Fire, water, above and
          below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal-
          ance.

Raziel begins to change.  Willow wrestles with his own
powers of concentration and will, now and then losing
strength.

                        RAZIEL
                   (voice distorted)
          Don't give up!  Willow!

He chants and strains.  Raziel momentarily changes into
a partly-formed grotesque creature.  Then into a deer.
Then she becomes human.  At last she becomes herself, a
once-beautiful and now elderly woman.  Willow covers
her unclothed body with a simple smock.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!

She looks down at her old hands.  Then her eyes focus
with purpose.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-
          low.  Bring in our brave men.

Willow opens the tent.  Some pigs shuttle in, and Ra-
ziel begins to change them back into warriors.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE -NIGHT

Stationed high on the castle wall, three Nockmaar MIN-
IONS laugh and drink.  Then they hear the terrible
SCREAM of the baby.  They look up at the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

A druid hits the ceremonial gong, twice.  The baby
shrieks.  Standing over her, Bavmorda crushes a piece
of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments
into a Witch's Bottle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Black fire forever kindled within,
          Let the second right begin!

With a pair of razor-sharp shears she clips the baby's
tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the Witch's
Bottle.  The bottle glows and sparks, and teh heavens
asnwer with distant thunder.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

In the dark Tir Asleen camp some figures crouch low and
hurry from tent to tent.  CLOSER, the faces of rebel
warriors, watching the castle wall.  Fear.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow, Raziel, Madmartigan, Sorsha, Airk Thaughbaer
and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth.

                         AIRK
          Uphill with our rough weapons,
          we'll never make it!

                        SORSHA
          Elora Danan will die!

                        RAZIEL
          By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the
          runic drum!

                        WARRIOR
          Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need
          more forces.  I say we retreat!

The other warriors agree.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda cannot transform you.
          I've protected this camp with a
          spell.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Can you use your magic to get our
          men into the fortress, Raziel?

Raziel shakes her head.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda has shielded it with a
          spell of her own.

The warriors grumble and protest.  In a corner, Rool
and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.  Curi-
ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep
though, scratching the ground with his fingernail.

The warriors rumble.

                        WILLOW
          Wait!!

Willow jumps to his feet.  They all turn to him.

                        WILLOW
          I have an idea.  Back in my village
          we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, this is war, not agricul-
          ture!

                        WILLOW
          I know, I know!  But this is a way
          to get into that castle...

The all gather around Willow to listen.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

Thunder rumbles.  Bavmorda looks up.  Her face is gra-
dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds.
A druid hits the gong three times.  Now three candles
are lit.  The baby screams on the altar.

With a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a
deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.  The
blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black
cloak.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

They all look at Willow.

                         AIRK
          It's too much work.

                        WARRIOR
          It can't be done.

                        SORSHA
          Kael will never fall for it.

Willow looks hopefully at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (doubtful)
          I don't know, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, you promised me you'd
          take care of Elora Danan like your
          own daughter.  She is all that
          matters.  Are you going to abandon
          her?

Madmartigan turns away and scratches his beard.

                         AIRK
          Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna
          listen to a Peck?  You and I are
          warriors.  You know this plan will
          never work.

Frustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away.
The men rally with Airk.  Mdmartigan goes over to Sor-
sha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          I have no family.

The gong rings four time.  Raziel turns to Airk
and his men.

                        RAZIEL
          If we do not fight, and the baby
          dies, all hope for the future is
          lost.  I shall face the danger
          alone if I have to.

The men shake their heads.

                        WILLOW
          Me, too.

Madmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm
and silences the protest.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time is running out.  We must now
          decide who's going to leave and who
          is going to stay...

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

Light pulsates in the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

The druids cower behind Bavmorda, whose face has taken
on the hideous features of a hellish beast.  The baby
has been streaked with ritual paint.

                       BAVMORDA
          Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!

Her voice growls a sickening chant, and light shoots
out of her claw-liek fingers, enveloping the baby.  The
baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAWN

The sun rises over the volcanic mountain.  The gong
strikes twelve times.  PAN ACROSS the slope outside the
castle.  The Tir Asleen army is gone.  Littered across
the ground are flattened tents, borken wagons an dis-
carded shields.  The wind howls, taking bits of debris
with it.

Alone on the deserted mounatinside stand Willow and Rz-
ziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Time is running out.

                        WILLOW
          Surrender!!

Nockmaar soldiers peer down and laugh.  Willow and Ra-
ziel trek closer to the castle wall.  Willow cups his
mouth.

                        WILLOW
          We are all-powerful magicians!
          Give us the baby or we will destroy
          you!!

The Nockmaar soldiers roar with laughter.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!

The great drawbridge falls across the moat.  Willow
clutches a spear and trembles nervously.

                        RAZIEL
          Patience, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Courage, Willow.

Hoofbeats.  EIGHT HORSEMEN ride out of the castle with
swords high.  Willow lifts his spear with two hands.
Turns.  And smashes the spear on the ground, striking a
loud war drum!

Suddenly Madmartigan leaps out of the ground on horse-
back!

And the entire mountainside comes to life.  Tents and
shields fly away and out of pits and trenches the Tir
Asleen army charges with one loud warcry!

The eight Nockmaar horsemen are quickly cut down.  The
rebels storm across the drawbridge into the castle.
Airk Thaughbaer scoops Willow up on his horse, and Sor-
sha scoops Raziel up on hers.

INT. NOCKMAAR COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Madmartigan leads the assault, cutting down Nockmaar
minions as they run out to defend the fortress.  Sorsha
slides off her horse with Raziel.  Airk sets Willow
down.  Sorsha leads Willow and Raziel into a dark hall-
way.

Rebel warriors storm into the courtyard.  Madmartigan
circles behind Airk, their horses dancing handsomely.

                         AIRK
          Let's squah 'em!

In unison, their swords flash and they charge across
the courtyard chopping down the enemy.

ENT CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

Sorsha hurries Willow and Raziel down a dark hallway.
They come to a corner.

                        SORSHA
          No, Willow!!

She grabs him by the collar and yanks him back.  A huge
DEATH DOG leaps out wiht a gnashing ROAR and Sorsha
kills it with her sword.  Willow sags with relief and
the women grab his hands and haul him further down the
tunnel.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

They come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into
the Queen's Tower.  Willow climbs nervously behind Ra-
ziel and Sorsha.  At the top in THE DOOR.  Light throbs
behind it.

Suddenly they hear a loud SHRIEK and the door shakes
and bangs.  Willow fals to his knees, frozen with
fear.

                        SORSHA
          I will face my mother alone.

Willow and Raziel stay back on the stairs.  Sorsha
climbs to the door.  Courageously, she opens it.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda's monstrous face FILLS THE SCREEN.

                       BAVMORDA
          Sorsha!!

Sorsha recoils in horror.  Bavmorda looks barely human:
she has transformed into a grotesque witch.  She waves
her gnarled hand and her druids attack Sorsha.  Sorsha
kills them.  The baby lies under a deathlike spell on
the copper altar.

                        SORSHA
          I won't let you kill her!

Bavmorda's voice is a demonic growl!

                       BAVMORDA
          You are a weakling.  Like you fa-
          ther!  Can you not see that I am
          about to become all-powerful!

Lightning explodes overhead.  Sorsha lunges for the
baby.  But Bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy
force.

                        SORSHA
          No!!

Pulsating light lifts Sorsha, levitates her across the
room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes.  Just as
she is about to be implaes, another force stops her.
Bavmorda can sense the source of it:

                       BAVMORDA
          Raziel...!!

The door flies open.  The twelve burning candles all
blow out.  There stands Raziel.  Sorsha falls to the
floor, unconscious.  Raziel raises her arms magnifi-
cently.  The sorceresses face each other.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Battle rages.  Madmartigan and Airk lead the assault,
and the Tir Asleen rebels push back the Nockmaar min-
ions.  Down low, where weapons adn bodies fall and
horses clop and stamp, the brownies scurry along in
terror, arms crossed over their heads, looking for
shelter.

Like mice, they dart up some stairs.  Then a huge boot
nearly crushes them.  The dive away and look up.
Towering high above them, Kael lets out a loud warcry.
And brandishes two weapons, a huge sword and a huge
axe.

Madmartigan and Airk turn and see Kael.  They look at
each other.  Like samurai warriors they stand ready.
Kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

Willow creeps toward the door.  It suddenly throbs and
flashes.  He jumps back.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda and Raziel oppose each otehr, circling the al-
tar.  The air between them crackles and sparks with the
concentration of energy between them.

                        RAZIEL
          The baby will be queen.  It has
          been foretold, Bavmorda.

                       BAVMORDA
          My ritual will kill the prophecy!
          Now the child dies with it, its en-
          ergy exiled into oblivion!
                  (lightning flashes)
          You see?  I hold the power of the
          universe!

                        RAZIEL
          Not until your ritual is complete!

                       BAVMORDA
          And who will stop me?  The elements
          are slaves to my command!

She points at the sky.  As if oberying her, lightning
flashes and thunder cracks.

                        RAZIEL
          There is no one who can match your
          sorcery.  Except me!

Raziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around
the room.  Bavmorda counters, and chairs come to life,
turning into beasts.  Objects fly about.  The tower be-
comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Kael swings his axe and sword at Airk and Madmartigan.
He roars at his army, and six Nockmaar swordsmen hurry
over to fight with him.  Madmartigan and Airk split up.
Madmartigan battles the six swordsmen.  Airk battles
Kael, who backs Airk up stairs on the castle wall.

Madmartigan fights in the courtyard.  He hears a yell
and looks up.  Kael strikes Airk down.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!!

Airk falls down the stairs.  Madmartigan finishes off
the swordsmen, then runs to him, grabs his bleeding
body.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Airk!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Madmartigan...you're a brave
          warrior...a true friend...a good
          man...

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're gonna win this war, Airk.

An incredible smile lights up Airk's face as he dies.
Madmartigan stands.  Picks up his sword.  And goes up
the stairs after Kael.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

The sorceress continue their battle.  They change
each other into various beasts.  They fight, physically
and magically.

In the midst of chaos, the door opens.  Willow pokes in
his head, reacting in fear.  Then sneaks around the
wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby.

                       BAVMORDA
          As above, so below!  Universe of
          evil, Raziel!  It conquers even
          you!

Bavmorda hurls a final spell at Raziel, crippling her,
throwing her into a corner.  Bavmorda laughs and goes
to the altar.  The baby is gone.

Willow races toward the door with the baby.  The door
suddenly slams shut.  Bavmorda's voice roars out:

                       BAVMORDA
          *Stop!  Bring back that child!!!*

Willow stops.  He turns around.  Bavmorda towers over
him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy Willow
with her magic.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who are you?

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician.

Bavmorda laughs.  Willopw slowly walks toward her.  he
digs into his pocket.  Takes out the last magic acorn.

                        WILLOW
          I'm a *great* magician.

Willow throws the acorn at Bavmorda.  Her hand shoots
out and catches it.  the acron begins to turn her to
stone, petrifying her hand, her wrist, her arm.  Willow
backs away, feeling successful.  But with intense con-
centration of her evil will, Bavmorda fights off the
acron's spell.  It reverses:  her arm, wrist and hand
turn back to flesh.  She crushes the acorn in her
fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor.

                       BAVMORDA
          Is that the extent of your power?

Willow stands there helplessly.  Thunder cracks and
lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the
altar.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

The Tir Asleen rebels, outnumbering and overpowering
the Nockmaar army, fight toward ultimate victory.

Madmartigan battles Kael on the wall outside the
Queen's Tower.  Up and up they go.  A spectacular
swordfight.  Until finally, Madmartigan stabs Kael
through the heart.  kael screeches and falls through
the air into the moat.

Madmartigna hurries toward the top of the tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda looks up at the sky then down at Willow.

                       BAVMORDA
          Place it on the altar.

                        WILLOW
          No.  You can't have her.

                       BAVMORDA
          By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw
          the lightning and send this child
          into the destructive realm.

Willow straightens up, boldly, courageously.

                        WILLOW
          And with my magic I'll send her 
          into the...into the...

He gropes for a word.  Bavmorda laughs at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're no magician.

                        WILLOW
          Into the good.

Bavmorda instantly stops laughing.  her eyes flash.

                       BAVMORDA
          Even I don't have the power to do
          that.  You're a fraud.

Willow suddenly starts chanting, loudly and desperate-
ly.  Raziel opens her eyes and watches.  The chenting
confuses Bavmorda.  Then, Willow cleverly whips the
baby under his legs and behind his back and suddenly
she's gone!

                       BAVMORDA
          Impossible!  Bordak!  Bordak!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.  She lunges across the
copper altar.  Thunder and lightning!

                       BAVMORDA
          Aaaaahhhh!!!

A bright fork of lightning, conjured by her own evil,
shoots in through the ceiling and strikes her.  She
howls in pain.  Her body contorts then bursts into
flame and burns into a shriveling pillar of ash.

Madmartigan breaks open the door and stomrs in.  He
scoops up Sorsha, reviving her with a kiss.

And as if Bavmorda's death has ended evil and oppres-
sion, Raziel stands up with renewed strength.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow...Willow...how...how did you
          do that?

Willow bends down under a nearby chair and picks up the
sleeping baby.

                        WILLOW
          It was just the old disappearing
          pig trick.

Elora Danan's eyes open.  And sunlight floods into the
tower.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Flags fly hihg above the wondrous caslte.  The valley
is lush with flowers, and the kingdom is once abain
alive with happy activity.

At the door of the castle, Willow stnds beside a cute
little white pony.  The court of Tir Asleen has gath-
ered to see him off.  Madmartigan, in robes and armor
worthy of a king, stands proudly beside his queen, Sor-
sha, who holds the baby princess, Elora Danan.

A trumpet blares.  Raziel comes forward from inside the
castle, dressed in druid robes, carrying a sacred BOOK.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow Ufgood.  Take this Book of
          Sorcery.  You are on your way to
          becoming a great magician.

Willow accepts the book.  Everyone applauds.  Willow
smiles gratefully and humbly.  He glances down and no-
tices Rool and Teemo, who have been civilized to a de-
gree with page boy uniforms, fuzzy haircuts, and nifty
little swords.

Madmartigan and Sorsha come forward, with Elora Danan.

                        WILLOW
          Your dream has come true, madmarti-
          gan.

Madmartigan smiles with thanks.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Goodbye, Peck.

Willow has one last look at the baby.  She smiles and
giggles at him.  He happily gives her a kiss.

                        WILLOW
          Farewell, Elora Danan.

Suddenly Willow flies up in the air.  Madmartigan lifts
him onto the pony's back.  Willow and Madmartigan shake
hands warmly.  And Willow rides across the valley of
flowers, everybody waving goodbye to him.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

Musicians stike up a welcoming march.  Willow rides
thorugh his village on his little pony, proudly carry-
ing the sacred book.  The Nelwyn people swarm around
him, wild with excitement and celebration.  Meegosh
runs up, deliriously happy.

The High Aldwin comes forward, beaming with pride, and
honors Willow with a nod of approval.  Willow presents
him with the book.  Old Burglekutt peers out.  His
mouth drops open and he shrinks away from the crowd.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Willow stands up in his stirrups.  He sees Kiaya fight-
ing her way through the crowd to reach him.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!!

He jumps off his pony and runs to her.  They collide,
kiss and embrace.  Then Ranon and Mims jump on their
father and hug him.  Family and friends smother their
homecoming hero with love!

                          Act I

FADE IN:

EXT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

Under gloomy sky a huge fortress looms on a volcanic
mountainside.  From within WE HEAR the agonizing scream
of a woman giving birth.

INT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY

The scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri-
dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a
dungeon.

INT.. DUNGEON - DAY

Silhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand
guard.  In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch
from behind iron bars.  The screaming stops.  There's a
moment of silence.  As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell
WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY.

In the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as
ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the
baby in swaddling.

                         DRUID
          Is it a girl?

                         ETHNA
          It is a girl.

                         DRUID
          Show me its arm.

Ethna peels back the swaddling.  On the baby's arm is a
small marking.

                         DRUID
          It's true then.  I must tell Queen
          Bavmorda.

With great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon
stairs.  Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's
breast.  The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it
stops crying.  Then she reaches out and clasps the
midwife's wrist.

                        MOTHER
          Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're
          going to kill my baby.

Ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes
her head at the mother.

                         ETHNA
          They'll kill you.

                        MOTHER
          Please save my baby.

Ethna hesitates.  Then decides.  She quickly wraps to-
gether some rags and gives them to the mother.

                         ETHNA
          Pretend this is the child.

                        MOTHER
          Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you.

The mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who
hides the baby inside the basket of rags.  Ethna car-
ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs.

The mother lies back and sighs with relief.  Then she
hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear.

QUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her
black robes flowing behind her.  The druid hurries
alongside.

                       BAVMORDA
          We will start the ritual at dusk.
          You're certain this is the one?

                         DRUID
          It bears the markings.

                       BAVMORDA
          I must see for myself!  Just as the
          omen foretold!

The guards fearfully move aside as Bavmorda enters the
cell.

                       BAVMORDA
          So.  You *were* the one.

                        MOTHER
          Yes.  But nothing you can do will
          stop the prophecy.

                       BAVMORDA
          This child will have no power over
          me....

Bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi-
ously tears them apart.

                       BAVMORDA
                      (furiously)
          Where's the baby!

One of the guards looks up the stairs.

                         GUARD
          The midwife!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.

                       BAVMORDA
          Find that baby!  Use the dogs!
          Sorsha!

Two guards draw swords and charge upstairs.  Bavmorda
grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kill her.

Bavmorda storms away with the druid.  WE SEE the shadow
of the guard move over the terrified mother.  War drums
begin to beat out an alarm.

EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

TITLES BEGIN.  The midwife hurries through swirling
show, clutching the baby.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate
village, driving ferocious DEATH DOGS into huts,
violently searching for the baby.  The oppressed, poor
VILLAGERS are yanked into the street.  Some of them are
beaten.  One is killed.

The midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby,
then runs away from the village.

EXT. GRASSLAND - DAY

Ethna treks across an open grass field.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

She huddles by a fire, exhausted and hungry, her
clothes filthy and torn, and she rocks the crying baby.
She hears dogs howling in the distance.  She clutches
the baby, kicks out the fire, and runs.

EXT. OCEAN CLIFFSIDE - DAY

She scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline.

EXT. FOREST - DAWN

Ethna runs desperately for her life.  Chasing her are
two vicious DEATH DOGS.  She scrambles across a shallow
river.  She claws at rock and tears away sticks and
driftwood matted together with weeds.  Into this she
places the baby and sets it afloat downstream.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!

The dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the
river.  The midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur-
ing the dogs.  As they attack her:

                        MIDWIFE
          I don't have her!  No!  No!

She grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash-
ing at the snarling dogs.

From the baby's view, as it floats down the river, WE
SEE the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees.

EXT. DOWNRIVER - DAY - MONTAGE

The little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the
current.  It glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over
rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

At last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping
the baby.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS

Suddenly WE HEAR rustling leaves, possibly another
Death Dog.  Then WE HEAR giggling.  Two children, RANON
and MIMS, watch in amazement from the riverbank.

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Holding onto a plow, WILLOW UFGOOD struggles behind a
huge hog.  From a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he
tosses seeds.

                         RANON
          Dada!  We found something in the
          river!

Willow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to-
ward him.  They grab his sleeves and tug him away from
his plow.

                        WILLOW
          I can't run off and play with you
          now.  I've got work to do.

                      RANON/MIMS
          But Dada, you gotta see it!  Hurry!

Willow drops his sack of seeds.  The ugly hog glares at
him like a guilty conscience.  The children squeal with
excitement as their father runs toward the river with
them.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

WE SEE Willow from the baby's view.  His eyes pop open.
He quickly backs his children away.

                        WILLOW
          Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't
          know where it's been.  It could be
          diseased.

                         MIMS
          It's a baby!

                         RANON
          It's not a Nelwyn baby.

                        WILLOW
          No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn
          baby.  It looks like a daikini...

                         MIMS
          Ooh, it's so cute...

                        WILLOW
          Mims!  Get back here!  It might
          bite you.

Willow drags Mims away.  Then the baby starts crying.

                         RANON
          Can't we keep it, Dada?

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely not.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!

Willow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis-
tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft,
plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying
baby.

                        WILLOW
          Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect --
          that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon,
          keep this thing hidden...

EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY

Burglekutt's beady eyes spot Willow making a mad dash
for his plow.  Swinging his fat stomach, he angrily
points his walking stick and goes after him.

                         KIAYA
          Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done
          anything wrong!

Willow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field,
her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow
quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all
day.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Ufgood!  What do you think you're
                doing!  I tell the planting seeds
                in this village.

                         KIAYA
          I told him we didn't steal it, Wil-
          low.

Burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of
Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          You haven't paid your debts.  Where
          did you get these seeds?

With pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife.

                        WILLOW
          In the forest.  My family's been
          gathering them since last fall.
          There's no law against that, Bur-
          glekutt.

Suddenly the children laugh in the distance.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!  You left the children
          alone by the river??

In alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur-
glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get
          your planting done before the rains
          start.  You're gonna lose this
          land.

He raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes
them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward
two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya
SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks
and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's
crazy."  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits.
Then runs as fast as he can to the river.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

Kiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up,
and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his
hips.

                        WILLOW
          Absolutely, under no condition, is
          anyone in this family going to fall
          in love with that baby.

They all fall in love as he speaks.  The children fol-
low Kiaya up on the bank, walking right past Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  We can't keep that baby.
          Mims, Ranon.  Hey!  I will not be
          ignored!

Ignored, Willow huffs after them across his unplowed
field.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow nervously paces as Kiaya pours water in a wood
tub and the children entertain the naked baby with
sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a
magic trick.

                        WILLOW
          This is bad.  If we're caught with
          that little daikini it'll be the
          end of us.  Careful, Ranon, I need
          that for the festival.
                (indicates magic cloth)
          Kiaya, what are we going to do?

                         KIAYA
          We're gonna give this baby a bath.

The baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the
bath.

                        WILLOW
          Burglekutt's right.  There's not
          enough time to finish plowing.
          We'll lose everything and I'll end
          up working in the mines.

He shudders at the thought.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, do you think we should take
          her to the Village Council?

                        WILLOW
          No, no!  They'll think it's a bad
          omen.  There'll be a flood or a
          drought or a plague and
          everybody'll blame me for it!

                         RANON
          Look.  What's that?

Willow leans forward.  On the baby's shoulder is a
small branded scar in a circular design.  It only adds
to Willow's fears.

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.  This is trouble.
          I'll talk to the High Aldwin about
          it tomorrow at the Festival.

The baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

The raucous BAND plays as NELWYNS dance and celebrate
amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers.  A
crowd cheers wildly as MINERS battle FARMERS in a tug-
of-war, finally yanking the farmers face-first into a
puddle of mud.  On a stage a HARLEQUIN dances delight-
fully.  While on a raised platform the five members of
the VILLAGE COUNCIL sit and observe, mildly amused.
The head councilman is Burglekutt.

The WE SEE Willow on another stage.  He flourishes his
colorful sticks and cloths.  In the audience WE NOTICE
his friend MEEGOSH, who wears a miner's apron, rooting
Willow on.

                        WILLOW
          And now!  For our final amazing bit
          of magic, I will make an entire pig
          completely disappear!

Meegosh applauds as Mims and Ranon trot out lugging a
tiny baby pig in a crate.  As Willow takes the pig out
it bites his hand and gets away.  Willow tackles and
squashes it.  The crowd laughs and half of them leave,
and Meegosh covers his face.

Mims and Ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket.  Willow
cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his
back and suddenly it's gone!  Impresse, the crowd
gasps.  Then the pig squeals and dashes through
Willow's legs and leaps off the stage.

                         CROWD
          Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!

Burglekutt and the Council shake their heads as Willow,
embarassed, picks up his things.  Meegosh trots up
with the pig under his arm.

                        WILLOW
          Meegosh, I'm in trouble.

                        MEEGOSH
          Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need
          a better pig, that's all.

But as they walk past the Village Council, and Bur-
glekutt sneers down at Willow, Meegosh catches on.

                        MEEGOSH
          Now Burglekutt's got you in the
          squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in
          the mines like me.

                        WILLOW
          Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces.
          That's the last thing I'd ever do.
                     (he shudders)
          I gotta get my crop planted.

                        MEEGOSH
          You know I'll help you as much as I
          can, Willow.

The Village Council members stand up respectfully as
the wise old HIGH ALDWIN hobbles through the adoring
crowd.  Mims and Ranon rush up to Willow with several
other children who are eating candy.

                         MIMS
          Dada, can we get treacle candy?
          Can we, can we?  Please?

                        WILLOW
                     (preoccupied)
          Meegosh, can you watch the chil-
          dren?  I gotta talk to the High
          Aldwin.

                        MEEGOSH
                    (truly amazed)
          The High Aldwin??  Why?

But Willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving
Meegosh with a dozen sugar-charged children and a pig.

Willow desperately pushes past people and finally
reaches the High Aldwin.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  I have to talk to you.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Not today, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          It's a matter of great importance
          to me!

Burglekutt stares angrily from his platform.  Slightly
annoyed, the High Aldwin stops and places his hand on
Willow's shoulder.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Intuition, Willow -- remember?  I
          know you're eager to be my appren-
          tice, Willow.  But today is the
          spring festival.

Suddenly a walking stick is pointed at Willow's nose.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!!
          Willow Ufgood???

His belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging
his councilmen to join in.  Willow shrinks away, em-
barassed.

Then a terrified SHRIEK shatters the festivity.  Music 
stops and people grab their children and run for their
lives.  A DEATH DOG rips a trail of destruction through
the village.

Meegosh holds onto Ranon and Mims.  But when Mims sees
Willow she runs right out into the open.  Willow
charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from
the beast's claws.

                       DEATH DOG
          Bordak!  Bordak!

A loud war cry distracts the dog.  VOHNKAR, the
toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army
of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks.  Wil-
low and Meegosh grab sticks.  The Nelwyns battle the
Death Dog.  At last, Vohnkar drives a spear through its
chest and it dies hideously.

                        MEEGOSH
          What was it looking for?

                      A VILLAGER
          It said "bordak"!  What does it
          mean?

                      COUNCILMAN
                      (scholarly)
          Baby!  It means baby!  It was look-
          ing for somebody's baby!

Mothers grab their children, people look around the
wrecked village in terror.  There's a haunting silence.

                         MIMS
          Mommy?

Suddenly alarmed, Willow races towrd his distant farm,
his children hurrying behind.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!  Kiaya!

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - DAY

Willow bursts in and finds Kiaya calmly feeding the
baby.  Relieved, he throws his arms around her.

                        WILLOW
          We can't keep this baby, Kiaya.  We
          must take her to the Council.

The children run in and they all huddle together, cher-
ishing their precious lives.

INT. COUNCIL BUILDING - DAY

Arguing villagers pack the church-shaped room to the
open door at the back and into the balconies above.
The councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the
High Aldwin seated in a special chair above them.  Tak-
ing charge, Burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with
his walking stick.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          An evil beast from the outer world
          has invaded our peaceful village,
          looking for a baby!

This only adds to the frenzy.

                      A VILLAGER
          It's a sign!  An omen!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Our crops will die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          Silence!  One beast we can kill.
          But there may be more!  And they
          won't give up their search till
          they've found what they're looking
          for!

                        MEEGOSH
          Whose baby is it!

                    OTHER VILLAGERS
          Who's to blame for this!

Amid the chaos the High Aldwin slowly stands up.  As if
he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the
back.

At the back door, holding the baby, Willow tries to
push his way through the jostling crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hand.  It flashes magically.  He
points as he speaks:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Willow Ufgood!  Come before me!

The crowd stands apart as Willow walks the length of
the room.  Kiaya and the children follow part way and
then stand aside next to Meegosh.  Burglekutt simmers
as Willow approaches the platform.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Earlier today you tried to tell me
          something, Willow.

                        WILLOW
                    (bows his head)
          My family found this baby in the
          river, High Aldwin.

The crowd stirs but the High Aldwin silences them with
a simple gesture.  He gazes down at the baby mysteri-
ously.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          A daikini child...
                   (his eyes close)
           ...of some importance, I feel...

                      BURGLEKUTT
          That's what the beasts want!  Give
          it back!

The crowd rumbles, many agree.

                        WILLOW
          They'll kill her!  We can't let
          this baby die!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          What do we care!

Burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd.  The High
Aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him.
Almost in a trance:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
           ...importance...yes...this child
          is special...

                      COUNCILMAN
          What should we do?

Instantly, the High Aldwin drops his arms and opens his
eyes.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          This child must be taken beyond the
          boundaries of our village.  All the
          way to the daikini crossroads.

The room goes silent.

                      A VILLAGER
          Who will do that?

                   SEVERAL VILLAGERS
          Vohnkar!  Vohnkar!

Vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and
pounds his chest once with his fist.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The outer world is dangerous and
          corrupt, Vohnkar.  And this baby is
          hunted by blood-hungry beasts.  Are
          you willing to sacrifice your life?

Brave Vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful-
ly.

                        VOHNKAR
          If I go, who'll defend you if other 
          beasts attack?

The crowd rumbles and shouts, and Vohnkar mops his brow
and scuttles away from the platform.

                      BURGLEKUTT
          He's right!  It seems only fair
          that the man to take this baby to
          the crossroads...
                  (walking stick up)
           ...be the very man who plucked
          it...
                 (walking stick down)
           ...out of the river!

All eyes turn to Willow.  Kiaya gasps and Meegosh holds
her back.

                        WILLOW
          I can't do it!  I haven't put my
          crop in!

                     A COUNCILMAN
          You caused this trouble.  You found
          the baby...you get rid of it!

                      BURGLEKUTT
          I nominate Willow Ufgood!

The crowd cheers wildly.  The High Aldwin steps forward
to the edge of the platform.  With a flourish he waves
his arms.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          I will consult the bones!

Something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands.  The
crowd jumps away.  The High Aldwin scatters small bones
across the floor below him.  He leans down and studies
the bones.  Willow looks at Kiaya, who is worried and
afraid.  The High Aldwin speaks softly to him:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones tell me nothing.
                   (he eyes Willow)
          But I must make a decision.  Is
          there love in your heart for this
          child?

Willow hesitates.  He looks at the baby.

                        WILLOW
          Yes.

The High Aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          The bones have spoken!  Willow?
          The security of this village
          depends on you!

The people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to
leave.  Kiaya and Meegosh and the children push their
way toward Willow, who stands there staring at the
baby.

INT. UFGOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

Kiaya's hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid.
Near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack.
On the other side of the fire, Willow diapers the baby.
The house is quiet.

                         MIMS
          Dada?

Willow sets the baby down.  He goes around an opne wall
an sits on his daughter's bed, straightening her blank-
ets and toys.

                         MIMS
          Watch out for brownies, Dada.

                        WILLOW
          I will, Mims.  Goodnight.

He smiles and kisses her.  Then crosses over to Ranon's bed.

                         RANON
          Dada, what's a daikini?

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis are giant people who live
          far far away.

                         RANON
          Are you scared?

Willow shrugs.  Ranon sits up in bed.

                         RANON
          I could be you rguard!  I could
          carry your spear!

                        WILLOW
                       (smiles)
          What a great son you are, Ranon.  I
          wish I could take you with me.  Now
          go to sleep...

Ranon slides down under his blankets.  Willow kisses
him, looks at him a moment, then quietly withdraws to-
ward the fire.

EXT. SACRED HILL - SUNRISE

The silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on
top.

Carrying the baby, Willow climbs the hill with his fami-
ly.  He wears a papoose rig, supply pack, and a dagger.
He hands the baby to Kiaya, then walks through the
towering stones.  The High Aldwin solemnly looks out at
the distant forest.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Now, you know where you're going?
               (Willow shakes his head)
          Down there, through those trees,
          follow the river.  You'll know the
          crossroads by a big daikini struc-
          ture.  Willow, this is serious
          business.  Don't waste any time,
          the outer world is no place for a
          Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first
          daikini you see, then hurry home as
          fast as you can.

                        WILLOW
          If I'm not strong enough to be your
          apprentice, how can I do this?

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          You're strong enough.  But you're
          going to need courage, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          I don't want courage.  I don't want
          to be a warrior.  All I've ever
          wanted was to do magic, real magic,
          like you!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Real magic, Willow, is simply the
          art of controlling the reality of
          others.  You lack faith in your-
          self.  You must learn to trust your
          intuition.

The High Aldwin picks up a rock.  With intense concen-
tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand.  Then
throws it in the air.  It changes into a bird and flies
away.

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Go in the direction the bird is
          flying.

                        WILLOW
                       (amazed)
          Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd
          turn Burglekutt into a toad!

                      HIGH ALDWIN
          Waste magic on revenge?  You have
          much to learn, Willow...

The High Aldwin touches Willow's shoulder and turns
away.  The children are playing tag among the stones.
Willow hugs them.  Kiaya places the baby in the papoose.

                         KIAYA
          Willow, we've never been apart.  I
          miss you already.  Take this.  It
          will bring you luck.

Kiaya, whose head is covered with a kerchief, places a
braided necklace on her own hair around Willow's neck.

                        WILLOW
          You cut your hair, Kiaya?

He kisses her.  The adjusts the papoose and heads off
down the hill.  The others wave goodbye sadly.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her
arms around Willow, tears in her eyes.  At last they
break apart, and Willow begins the journey.

EXT. WOODS - DAY - MONTAGE

Willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain,
amazed and frightened.  Animals rustle in the brush and
he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking
burrs off his legs.  He hides from a fierce bear.  The
bear sees him and runs away.  Willow hurries along,
shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's
weight.

EXT. ROAD - EVENING

The baby is fussing hungrily.  Willow impetuously digs
a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to
feed her.  Then he hears something.  Sensing danger, he
clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank.  He
hides under a bridge.

NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS on horseback thunder toward the
bridge, led by the knight SORSHA whose face is hidden
under a black helmet and visor.  In the other direction
Willow sees a LIEUTENANT and two DEATH DOGS.  They all
meet on the bridge.  The hideous soldiers are part hu-
man, part beast.

                      LIEUTENANT
          We've patrolled the hills.  This is
          where they killed the nursemaid.

                        SORSHA
          She must have done something with
          the child.  Widen the search!

One of the Death Dogs is chewing on the Lieutenant's
stirrup.

                      LIEUTENANT
          Get away from there!

The dog panics and gnashes at the Lieutenant's arm,
ripping away a piece of armor with its teeth.  Horses
rear.  The Lieutenant draws his sword lightning-fast.
He slices and kills the Death Dog.  The baby begins to
cry but the death-howl of the beast drowns her out as
it does hurtling off the bridge into the river below.
The soldiers gallop off into the woods.

Willow falls back against the riverbank, shrinking away
from the murdered Death Dog which lies bloody and
twisted in the water.  The terrified baby cries in his
arms.

EXT. ROAD - MORNING

A harmless rabbit springs across Willow's path.  Willow
trips over a stone and almost falls flat on his face.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.  Where am I?  I should
          stick you in a tree and go back
          home.
                    (looks at baby)
          I'm sorry.  I didn't mean that.

He hurries along the road, looking over his shoulder.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - DAY - MONTAGE

Various VIEWS of Willow and the baby trekking across
vast hills and valleys.

EXT. HILL - DAY

Gasping with exhaustion, Willow staggers up a sloping
hill and drops to his knees.  His eyes brighten.  In
the distance he sees a junction marked by a high wooden
scaffolding.

                        WILLOW
          That's it.  The crossroads...

He stands and heads toward it cautiously.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The place is disgusting.  Littered with junk, buzzing
with flies, plagued with rodents.  Willow creeps toward
the scaffolding, covering his face against the stench.
From it hang two cages.  In one is a heap of filthy
rags.  In the other a half-clothed skeleton with one
bony arm dangling out.

Willow unpacks the papoose and looks up the deserted
road.  He shivers with cold.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

Willow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face.
The baby fusses and squirms.  He peeks inside her
diaper.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

He looks anxiously up and down the road.  The baby's
crying gets worse.  He begins to change her.

EXT. CROSSROADS - SUNSET

Willow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint
and blowing it into flame.  The baby lies quietly near-
by in a kind fo porta-crib made of papoose and twigs.
Nightfall teems with spooky noises:  crickets, frogs,
bats, owls and howling wolves.  Then a terrible moan
frightens him.

                        WILLOW
          I really hate this.

Not sure where it came from. he backs away from the
fire, under the rag-filled cage.  Suddenly a hand
reaches down and yanks Willow up off the ground!  Wil-
low screams.  The baby cries.  And WE SEE the haggard
unwashed unshaven face of MADMARTIGAN pressing against
the bars of the cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hey, Peck...get me some water...or
          you'll diiiiie...!

Madmartigan shakes Willow like a rag-doll until Willow
nods his head yes.  Then drops him.  Instantly Willow
races around that fire, picking up everything he owns.

                        WILLOW
          I will--I'll getcha water--getcha
          lotsa water--anything you say--!

Willow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the
bushes.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!

He dives headfirst into the weeds.  Madmartigan rattles
his cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a weasely little Peck!
          Gimme some water!

Willow peeks at him and shakes his head.

                        WILLOW
          I'm not coming near you!

They stare at each other across the fire.  Then, Mad-
martigan puts on a very phony smile.

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Good.  How long will it take?

Madmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't make me angry, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          You be careful.  I'm a powerful
          sorcerer.  I could turn you into a
          toad just like that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Miserable Pecks.

Willow throws a rock at him.  It bounces off the cage.
Madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again.

EXT. CROSSROADs - NIGHT

The wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls.
Willow rocks the baby and eats some bread.  Madmartigan
watches him hungrily, sighing, forlorn, his eyes asking
for pit.  Willow glances at him.  Finally, he can't
take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some
goat's milk in a cup.  He reaches up on tip-toes and
offers the milk to Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's more like it.

Madmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk,
retching horribly at the taste.  Then he tosses the cup
back.

                        WILLOW
          Do any other daikinis ever come by
          here?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Why.

                        WILLOW
          I have to give this baby to some-
          body.

Madmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm somebody.  Lemme out and I'll
          take care of your baby.

He makes little kissing noises to the baby, trying to
be sweet.  However, his teeth are filthy.

                        WILLOW
          No.  Somebdoy put you in there for a
          reason.  I'll wait for somebody else.

Willow retreats to the fire.  Madmartigan whacks the
cage with the back of his hand.

EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT- LATER

By the blazing fire Willow feeds the baby.  WE HEAR
hoofbeats.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Somebody's coming!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!

Excited, Willow tosses more wood on the fire, picks up
the baby and waits.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No, you fool!  Put it out I say!
          Out!

Torches appear up the road.  A horse-drawn wagon
clatters full-speed toward the fire.  WE HEAR load
drunken voices, far from friendly.  Willow quickly
dives into the bushes.

Four boorish PICTS, with tatooed faces and arms, halt
at the crossroads, yelling and waving their torches.
Madmartigan is hidden under his rags.  For fun the
Picts set fire to the skeleton cage.  Then head for the
other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!

He rises up in the torchlight.  The Picts taunt him.

                         PICT
          Whose fire!

They jab their torches at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!  Help!  Stop!

                         PICT
          Where are they?  Where did they go?

Madmartigan points way up the road.  The Picts ride
away.  As they go, they swing his cage and st fire to
the floor of it.  Madmartigan frantically geats the
flames.  His sleeves ignite.

Willow scrambles out of the bushes and scoops up hand-
fuls of dirt, which he chucks at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                  (spitting out dirt)
          Thanks for your help, Peck.

                        WILLOW
          Are you okay?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          As if you care.  I saved your life,
          Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!
                 (points dramatically)
          You wanna give your baby to them??
          They eat babies!

                        WILLOW
          I don't know.

Madmartigan literally licks his wounds, dragging his
parched tongue along the length of his forearm.  Willow
begins to walk away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The world's gone insane.  Good men
          locked in cages, criminals running
          free.  It doesn't pay to be honest,
          Peck.

Willow stops and turns around.

                        WILLOW
          Don't call me a Peck.  My name is
          Willow.

Madmartigan slinks down like a cat and slowly extends
his derty hand through the bars.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, Willow.  I'm Madmartigan.

Willow stares warily at the hand.  Madmartigan smiles.
Willow quickly shakes his hand and jumps away.  Madmar-
tigan laughs in a harmless, friendly way.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You a woodcutter?

                        WILLOW
          Farmer.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic-
          tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me:
          victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor-
          rupt, rotten world.

A rat lumbers out of the darkness and sniffs toward the
baby in the porta-crib.  Madmartigan suddenly points.
Willow screams and chases the rat away.  Madmartigan
shakes his head as solemnly as an undertaker.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Listen, Willow my friend.  I'm
          really a good man.  Give me my
          freedom, and I'll look after that
          baby for you.  Trust me.

After a moment, Willow takes out his dagger.  He stands
on his toes under a cage, reaches up, and hacks at the
chain lock.  Madmartigan's eyes widen over-eagerly.  he
rubs his hands together and licks his lips.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That's it--good--good--like that,
          yes, good, good, the chain--that's
          it, come on--come on--!

Willow suddenly steps away.

                        WILLOW
          Nooo, I don't think I should.

Madmartigan goes berserk.  His arms flail and the whole
cage shakes and swings and he bangs his head on the
roof.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Peck!!  Stupid Peck!  I'll kill ya!
          Let me out!

Willow scrambles back to the fire and scoops up the
baby and rocks her in his arms.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAWN

Madmartigan is making something out of scraps of bark
and cloth.  He smiles sweetly as Willow wakes up.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Morning, Willow.

Willow turns his back on him and tends to the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorry I yelled at you.  I've been
          in this cage toooo long.  Can't
          think straight anymore.  Owww...!

Willow looks over.  madmartigan pats his arms in pain.

                        WILLOW
          You all right?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...

He holds up his arms in agony.  Willow fishes some
gooey jelly out of his sack and smears a gob of it on a
leaf.  He hands it up to Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          See if this helps.

Madmartigan wipes the goo all over his arms.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Aaaaaahhhh.  Better.  Here, I made
          something for the baby.

He holds out a ratlle and shakes it.  Willow accepts
it.

                        WILLOW
          What's inside?

Madmartigan sticks his finger in his mouth and pries it
open as wide as possible.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A tooth.
                   (Willow reacts)
          I'm strving.  I got no used for it.

Noise in the distance.  up the road Willow sees a
MESSENGER charging on horseback.  He gallops right
past, whipping his horse, almost knocking Willow off
the road.  Then another MESSENGER follows with the same
urgency.  Willow grabs the baby and steps out to stop
him.

                        WILLOW
          Stop!  Wait!

The messenger screams a Willow who jumps aside as he
thunders by.  The two horsemen disappear up the road.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                   (with authority)
          Smells like a battle.

                        WILLOW
          Are you a warrior?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The greatest swordsman that ever
          lived.

Madmartigan slices the air with an imaginary sword.
Willow shakes his head and goes back to the baby.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

WE SEE the empty road.  Willow's head pops INTO FRAME.
He grabs the baby.

                        WILLOW
          What's that?  I hear something!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You hear trouble.

                        WILLOW
          What is it?

The horizon rumbles.  Madmartigan cups his ear.  Cyni-
cally:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          A hundred horses...five or six
          wagons...  and about six thousand
          fools.

Two CAVALRY OFFICERS gallop into view, raising a plume
of dust.  Then an enormous ARMY appears:  cavalry, foot
soldiers, assault wagons: shields, swords, spears,
raised banners.

The two officers shout orders over the thunderous
clamor of hoofbeats, marching boots and clanking armor.
Charging back and forth, they shepherd the army through
the crossroads.  Willow holds the baby.  Fighting dust
and noise he tries to get the officer's attention.

                        WILLOW
          Sir?  Sir!

                        OFFICER
          Out of the way!

An officer's horse nearly kicks Willow, who scurries
out of the way.  Huddling with the baby, he notices
AIRK THAUGHBAER, a large, muscular, bearded officer,
clearly in charge.  On horseback, Airk breaks file and
rides up to the other officers.

                         AIRK
          Push 'em harder!  No rest at mid-
          day!  We need to make ten more
          leagues by dark!

Shouting orders, the officers split up, charging to the
front and rear of the army.  Airk watches the army
pass.  Willow desperately scrambles up to him.

                        WILLOW
          Sir!  Sir!  I have this baby.  We
          found her in our village.  Will you
          take her...?

Huge Airk looks down from his huge horse.  Little Wil-
low holds up the baby.

                         AIRK
          We're going into battle, little
          one.  Find a woman to take care of
          it.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He thought you were a woman, Airk!

Airk snaps hes head around and his eyes flash.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan!  What did you do this
          time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nothing you wouldn't have done it my
          place!

Airk's horse prances menacingly around Madmartigan's
cage.

                         AIRK
          I always knew you'd end up in a
          crow's cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Least I'm not down there herding
          sheep!

Airk laughs sourly and rocks the cage.

                         AIRK
          You're lucky somebody got to you
          first, Madmartigan!  I'd've killed
          you myself after that stunt at
          Land's End!

He swings that cage and starts to ride away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa
          here.

                         AIRK
                  (really sarcastic)
          Hey, remember?  You don't need my
          help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit
          trap like this?  Come on!  I could
          open it for you, but I wouldn't
          wanna insult you!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your
          war for you.

Airk quickly drops the banter and glares at Madmartigan seri-
ously.

                         AIRK
          You're nothing but trouble, Madmar-
          tigan.  And I got plenty of that.
          Stay in your coffin and rot!

Airk spurs his horse and smashes the cage as he charges
off.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll be around long after you're
          dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get
          outa here I'll cut your head off
          and stick it on a pig-pole!

                        WILLOW
          Friend of yours?

Madmartigan snarls down at Willow as the army continues
to march by.  But then he quickly gets cute again.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hello, little baby...

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY - LATER

A ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads.  The road
is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks.  Willow
shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

Madmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his
cage.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nobody's gonna take your baby.
          Know why?  Nobody cares...
                        (beat)
          Except me.
                      (wistfully)
          You wanna go back to your farm.
          You wanna go back to your family.
          I could take care of that baby.
          I'll look after her like she was me
          own.

                        WILLOW
          You don't know anything about ba-
          bies.

Madmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his
finger astutely.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahhh!  But I know a lot of women
          who do.  Why, if I had somebody in
          my life--a little daughter for
          instance--I'd have a reason to
          live...

He clsps his hands together outside the bars, plead-
ing:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow.  You can't let me die here.
          Not when I wanna help you.

Willow looks at the baby in the porta-crib.  Then looks
up the empty road.  Then looks hard at Madmartigan.

                        WILLOW
          You gotta promise to feed her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I will.

                        WILLOW
          Fresh goat's milk.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Absolutely!

Willow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the
chain.

                        WILLOW
          And give her a bath everyday, and
          don't let her get cold.  And keep
          her diaper changed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Of course!  I promise!

Willow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks
open.  The bottom of the cage falls out, dumping Mad-
martigan into a heap of rags and dust.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come to Daddy, little darlin'.
                    (picks her up)
          I think she likes me!

Kneeling on the ground, he plays with the baby.  Willow
quickly hitches the papoose to Madmartigan's back and
hands him supplies.

                        WILLOW
          Here are her diaper rags.  And this
          is her milk bladder.  And when she
          cries--she's either hungry or she's
          tired--rock her on your left
          shoulder.  She likes that.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good
          hands.  You haven't made a mistake.

Willow takes the baby and kisses her.

                        WILLOW
          Bye.

He puts her in the papoose.

                        WILLOW
                   (to Madmartigan)
          Please take good care of her.

Madmartigan stands up.  He towers above Willow.  He
pats Willow on the head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You've done a great job.  Now you
          go back to your family and get your
          crop in.

Madmartigan smiles, turns, and marches off down the
road.  Willow sighs with relief, his task accomplished.
He watches Madmartigan and the baby disappear over a
hill.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Swinging his arms and whistling a tune, Willow struts
proudly up a gentle hill.

                        WILLOW
          Look, it's Willow Ufgood!  He's
          come home!  Welcome back, Willow!
          He deserves a medal:  he's quite
          mystical.  For honor, for bravery,
          for his intuitive powers...
                     (he chuckles)
           ...let's make him Apprentice
          Aldwin.  Better still:  High
          Aldwin!  Make way!  It's Willow Uf-
          good, High Aldwin of---

The baby cries!  Willow spins around.  Flying towrd
him is an incredible VULTURE with enormous winds.  In
its claws it carries the baby, papoose and all.  It
swoops straight at Willow, buzzing him, and Willow hits
the dirt.  He looks up.  To add to the wonder:  riding
the vulutre is an ELF.

                        WILLOW
          Come back here, you!  That's my
          baby!!

The vulture zooms off into the tall majestic trees of
the forest, with the baby crying.  Shouting and waving
madly, Willow gallops after it.

EXT. THROUGH THE FOREST - DAY

Willow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the
towering trees.  As the path narrows, something whis-
tlse past his ear.  Finger-length arrows rain down on
him from every direction, peppering the surrounding
trees.  Some even hit Willow.  He plucks them out as he
races along.

He comes to a fork in the path:  Decision!  He starts
down one way, then slams on the brakes.  He sees ropes
and nets.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no, it's a trap!

He hurries back to the fork and takes the safer route--

                        WILLOW
          Oh noooooo!!

--and gets swallowed by a deadly pit.

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - UNDERGROUND

Willow wakes up as a pail of water hits him in the
face.  His feet and wrists are being bound.  Several
little ELVES are gawking and laughing at him.  They
wear samurai-type outfits and angry little haircuts.

                        WILLOW
                      (focusing)
          Where am I?  Where's the baby?

FRANJEAN, the Elfin king, struts forward arrogantly.
He speaks a haughty, nasal accent resembling French:

                       FRANJEAN
          I am Franjean, king of the world.

Willow struggles against the ropes that bind him.

                        WILLOW
          That baby's my responsibility!

Outraged, Franjean smacks Willow's nose with the
back of his hand.

                       FRANJEAN
          I don't care.  We paid for her.  Go
          back to sleep, monsieur...

As he leaves, Franjean nods to an intense-looking ARCH-
ER elf heavily armed with arrows and a spear.  The
archer dips his spear in a bowl of purple liquid.  He
pricks Willow's arm.

                        WILLOW
          Yeow!
                (he loses consciousness)
          Madmartigan...I never should've
          trusted you...

FADE TO BLACK

INT. ELFIN THRONE ROOM - DAWN

Willow's eyes open.  A wild little face is looking at
him.  A wild little person is standing on his chest.

                         TEEMO
          Tongue.

Too groggy to argue, Willow sticks out his tongue.
TEEMO the brownie crushes a brittle leaf and tosses the
dust into Willow's mouth.  Smacking his lips, Willow
comes around.  He sees, down between his legs, another
brownie named ROOL cutting the ropes.

                        WILLOW
          Who are you?

                         ROOL
          Quiet, you fool!

                         TEEMO
                       (formal)
          We are emissaries of her majesty,
          Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of
          Coshairm.

                        WILLOW
          Queen Cherlindrea?

                         TEEMO
          She requests the presence of your-
          self and the young princess.

                        WILLOW
          Who??

                         TEEMO
          You're the guardian, aren't you?

                         ROOL
          Quit yakking, Teemo.  We gotta get
          outa here!

Willow rolls onto his knees, stands up and bumps his
head on the ceiling.  The fuzzy-headed brownies creak
open the door and becon Willow to follow.  He squeezes
through.

INT. ELFIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND

Like a rabbit warren, compartments branch off the main
tunnel.  Willow scrunches along behind the tip-toeing
brownies.  They hear the baby crying.  They peek
through the door.

Inside a cluttered room they see thebaby crying miser-
ably.  Her tears are being carried to a high level in
tiny buckets on a mechanized wheel, operated by FOUR
ELVES.

                         TEEMO
          Elves!  They're always tormenting
          babies.  They make them cry and
          take their tears.

                         ROOL
          Somebody has to do it.

                        WILLOW
          Why??

                         ROOL
          How else they gonna make dew drops?

The baby shrieks.

                        WILLOW
          I'm getting her out of there!

                         TEEMO
          No!  You let us handle this.  Come
          along, Rool!

Teemo ridiculously pushes Willow away from the door.
With a macho swagger he adjusts his dagger belt, and he
and Rool open the door.

INT. ELFIN TEAR FACTORY

They enter like gunslingers in a saloon.  The four
elves, who are twice their size, turn and face them.
Teemo draws his small dagger.  With confidence he
smiles at Rool.

                         TEEMO
          Watch this.  Right between the
          eyes.

                         ROOL
                    (to the elves)
          He never misses.

Artfully Teemo poises the dagger above his head.  With
all his might he throws.  His dagger flip-flops through
the air and lands at the elves' feet, plink-plunk.

                         TEEMO
          Ooops.  Was that right?  That
          wasn't right.

Suddenly the entire wall implodes.  The elves scream
and panic as Willow comes crashing in like King Kong.
He grabs the crying baby and tucks her under his arm.

EXT. ELF HOLE - DAY

The brownies scamper out of a hole in the ground where
the elves keep their vultures corralled.

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Hyah!  Hyah!  Git!

They untie th evulture and send them flapping away in
the forest as Willow wiggles out of the elf hole with
the baby.  They run for their lives.

EXT. FOREST - CHASE - DAY

Rool and teemo tear along at incredible speed, Willow
barely keeping up with them.  Little elf arrows shower
the forest as the angry elves chase after them, whoop-
ing and screaming.

EXT. DEEP GORGE - DAY

They skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion.
The elves are shrieking toward them. The only chance
of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge.
The brownies scamper out.  Willow looks down and reels
with vertigo.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go out there with the baby!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
                  (frantically point)
          Elves!!

The elf army pours out of the forest.  Willow holds his
breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of
the tree.  Arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a
drunken tightrope walker toward the middle.  The brown-
ies wait for him.

                        WILLOW
          Ohhh, I hate this.

                         TEEMO
          Take your time.  Don't worry about
          the elves.  They won't come out
          here.

                        WILLOW
          Why not?

                         ROOL
          Because of the trolls.

                        WILLOW
          Trolls?

The brownies console Willow with unworried laughter.

                         TEEMO
          Relax.  They only come out at
          night.

An ugly TROLL snarls up behind Willow.  They all scream
and race for the other side.  Another TROLL pops up to
meet them.  The trolls slink along like possums.  The
brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk.

The elves, meanwhile, flint-start a fire at their end
of the tree.  One troll claws at the brownies inside
the trunk while the other chases Willow across gangling
branches.  Then the baby falls out of the papoose!  She
tumbles and catches on a low branch and Willow races
the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into
the gorge.

One troll catches Rool but can't then get his claw out
of the trunk.  The brownies finally excape.  The tree
burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots.
A troll howls as he falls to his death.  The other
scrambles up the tree and grabs Willow's foot.
Willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll.

Flames lick at Willow as he at last hauls himself to
safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree
goes crashing down in the gorge.

                        WILLOW
          This is not going well.

                         TEEMO
          Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know
          what to do.

Willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into
the forest.  Hobbling slightly on his bootless foot.

EXT. MAJESTIC FOREST - SUNSET

Fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful
trees as Willow and the brownies trek into the magical
Fairy Kingdom.  Elora Danan falls into a peaceful
sleep.

EXT. FAIRY KINGDOM - NIGHT

Willow comes to a halt.  His mouth drops open.  The
forest is a luminous Milky Way of dancing, flying
FAIRIES, like fireflies.  The brownies tug at his
pant-legs and whisper.

                         TEEMO
          Come on.  This is a privilege.  No-
          body ever gets called before Her
          Majesty.

Wonder-struck, Willow walks into a clearing where
colorful night-flowers bloom.  He lowers himself onto
an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand.  Other
BROWNIES stand watching, like courtiers.  The tiny
fairies fly up to Willow's face and giggle:  they look
like five-year-old girls, full of mischief and fun.

Suddenly a strange LIGHT begins to throb behind the
trees, peircing the forest with helter-skelter beams.
Willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings
his eyes.

                         ROOL
          Stand up!  It's the queen!

CHERLINDREA, the Fairy Queen, materializes out of frag-
ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph-like, beauti-
ful.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Willow Ufgood.

                        WILLOW
                       (blinded)
          Yes...?

                      CHERLINDREA
          I hope you are comfortable here,
          inside my kingdom...

Willow says nothing, still batling the bright light.

                         TEEMO
          Talk!  Say something!

                        WILLOW
          I can't see anything--she's too
          bright!

                      CHERLINDREA
          I'm sorry...

The light diminishes, enabling Willow to see the queen.
She is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi-
nous eyes.  Her magical presence both stuns and
impresses Willow.  She turns to the brownies.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Broke-heart of nightingale for our
          honored guest.

All the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into
action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip-
ping over one another.  They bring Willow a drink in a
delicate cup-shaped leaf, and he takes a sip.

The queen dissolves and reappears near Willow.  She le-
ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at
the mark on the baby's arm.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy
          has come true.

The tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh
with respect and amazement.  Cherlindrea seems to levi-
tate the baby out of Willow's arms, floating her magi-
cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks.  The
brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever-
ence.

                        WILLOW
          You mean, you know who this baby
          belongs to?

                      CHERLINDREA
          She belongs to all of us.  She is
          the future queen and ruler of all
          kingdoms on earth.

Willow starts to get up.

                        WILLOW
          What a relief.  Now I can go home.

The queen fragments and reappears right in front of
Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          No, Willow.  Your journey has just
          begun.  It has been foretold that
          this child shall bring about the
          downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose
          evil powers have darkened our
          world.  Upon you depends this
          princess's life.

                        WILLOW
          Me?

The Fairy Queen flashes and vanishes.  Willow lowers
himself back down again.  She reappears behind him.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are the guardian, Willow.  You
          must take her to Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          What is Tir Asleen?

Willow can't keep track of her.  She keeps changing her
shape.  The brownies and fairies snicker at Willow's
confusion.

                      CHERLINDREA
          It is a distant castle, where a
          great king and queen will look
          after Elora Danan and keep her safe
          until she is old enough to rule.

She is gone again.  Willow looks everywhere, frusturated
by these riddles and mysteries.

                        WILLOW
          Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is
          it?

She reappears again.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The way has been lost in time. But
          there is one person, a druid sor-
          ceress, who might guide you there.
          She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda
          many years ago.  Her name is Fin
          Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You need a warrior for this job.
          I'm nobody.

                      CHERLINDREA
          You are very important, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          No I'm not.  Have you really looked
          at me?
                  (jumps to his feet)
          I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!

From down at his feet, Rool and Teemo stare up, insult-
ed.

                        WILLOW
                     (continuing)
          Why can't you do it?  You have mag-
          ical powers.

                      CHERLINDREA
          My prsence cannot extend beyond
          this forest.  But I can give you
          these...

Cherlindrea drops three small objects in Willow's hand.

                      CHERLINDREA
          They will protect you.  Use them
          wisely.

Willow looks at them for quite a while.

                        WILLOW
          They look like acorns.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Anything you hurl them at will turn
          to stone.

Willow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the
queen.

                        WILLOW
          They're magic?  Are you serious?

The forest light grows brighter.  The queen looms over
Willow and he again has to shield himself from the
brightness.

                      CHERLINDREA
                       (sternly)
          I am very serious, Willow.  There
          is no time to lose.

Now she intensifies her light so that Willow backs
away, completely covering his face.

                        WILLOW
          But I've got a family to think
          about!  They need me!

The queen swirls around him like a solar wind, blowing
the forest trees, scaring even the brownies.  And then
all of a sudden:  silence.  And total darkness.  ALL WE
SEE, in dim moonlight, is Willow's face, peeking out
from between his fingers.

                        WILLOW
          Hello...?

The queen's voice echoes the forest.

                      CHERLINDREA
          Bavmord'a powers are growing like
          an evil plague.  Soon she will con-
          trol the lives of you children,
          your wife, your village...everyone.

Very gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin
to flicker, restoring light to the forest.  More light
genlty brightens, bathing the woods, and the Fairy
Queen reappears.  She is holding Elora Danan in her
arms.  The brownies creep out from behind the trees.
All eyes are upon Willow.

                      CHERLINDREA
          The choice is yours.

Willow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment.
He struggles with his conscience.  The fairies and
brownies wait in anticipation.  At last Willow looks up
at them, resolved and determined.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it.  Yes, I will, I'll do
          it!

The fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause.
Fairies giggle playfully around Willow's face, and
brownies hug his ankles.

                        WILLOW
          But I only have one shoe.

EXT. WOODED HILL - DAY

WE SEE Willow's feet as he walks along.  He has himself
a brand-new shoe.

Spirits high, he treks in the sunshine, papoose
strapped to his back.  Teemo rides in his pocket, while
Rool straddles the papoose, tickling the giggling baby.

                        WILLOW
          Wait till I tell my children.
          Stuff like this never happens in my
          village.

He digs a magic acorn out of his pocket and tosses it
high in the air.  The brownies gasp.

                         TEEMO
          Hey, careful there!

                        WILLOW
          How do these work I wonder?  I got-
          ta save one to show the High
          Aldwin.

                         ROOL
          Look!  Death below!

Rool points through the trees.  Willow hurries down the
hill to the tree-line.  In the valley below, 200 NOCK-
MAAR SOLDIERS and CALVALRYMEN battle a hundred ragtag
REBEL TROOPS.  From this sage position high on the
hillside, Willow watches in disgust.  Weapons clash and
men fall to their deaths.

                        WILLOW
          Daikinis...

They hear a CLANK behind them.  Willow slowly turns
around.  There is movement in the trees.  The hillside
woods are full of Nockmaar HORSEMEN moving right up next to him.

In the valley, the oupowered rebels are being forced
up the hill toward them.  Willow is suddenly standing
under several large horses and black-armored minions.
He is frozen in fear.

                       HORSEMEN
          Hyaaaaahh!!

Swords flash and the horseman charge!  The brownies
jump and run for their lives.  Willow stumbles and
spins as horse after horse thunders past him, nearly
trampling him and the baby to death.

The Nockmaar reinforcements descend upon the remaining
rebels and crush them.  Willow falls and quickly digs
the baby out of the papoose.  She is shrieking in ter-
ror.  He holds her tight and runs along the tree-line,
following the brownies, while the bloody battle rages
below.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here.  Shhh, don't
          cry, Elora.  Things can't get any
          worse than this...

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Bleak rain dribbles down Willow's miserable face.  Pro-
tecting the baby, he hurries toward a tavern.  The bot-
tom of the building is an open stable with several
horses.  Two burly IRON-WORKERS clank a red-hot wagon
rim, fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse.

It's a rough place.  Rool and Teemo peek out of
Willow's pockets.  Upstairs PEOPLE drink and shout.

                         TEEMO
          I'm not going in there.

                         ROOL
          Me neither!

                        WILLOW
          Don't worry--I'm a sorcerer.  What
          could possibly happen?

Suddenly there's a CRASH up above and two PICTS burst
through a balcony and land in the mud, fighting vi-
ciously.  Rool and Teemo duck inside Willow's pockets.
Willow steps around the Picts, dashes through the
stable and up the stairs.

INT. TAVERN - MAIN ROOM - DAY

The place is packed with tattooed PICTS, nomadic FAMI-
LIES, MOTHERS wit BABIES, THIEVES and CUTTHROATS.
Willow enters with the crying baby.

                        WILLOW
          Could you spare some milk for this
          poor hungry baby?

Everyone looks up.  Mopping a table is an ugly BARMAID
as big as a wrestler.

                        BARMAID
          Get outa here, Peck!

                        PATRONS
          A Peck!  Get him out!  Beat it,
          Peck!

They hurl stuff at him and threaten him with their
weapons.  Willow runs along the wall and takes cover
under some stairs.  He pulls open his pocket and peers
down inside.

                        WILLOW
          I could use your help, boys.

Instantly his pocket whips shut and trembles.  Willow
cautiously looks out under the stairs.  He sees a pail
of milk very near some ROUGHNECKS.  Willow puts his
little finger in the baby's mouth, silencing her.  He
creeps out.  And bravely reaches for the milk.

                     TEEMO'S VOICE
          Willow?

Willow slaps his pocket.  Then stretches his arm out
very, very slowly.  And gets the pail and zips back
under the stairs.

                        WILLOW
          This is not fun.

He soaks a rag with milk and feeds the baby.  Catching
his breath, he backs up and leans agains a woodplank
wall.

                        WILLOW
          Woah!

The plank gives way and Willow falls through the wall.

INT. TAVERN - DAY

Willow somersaults into a bedroom near an unmade bed.
Peeking up he sees two women getting dressed in a pan-
ic.  One is a plump-chested WENCH with a pretty face.

                         WENCH
          Hurry!  Hurry!

Very frightened, she looks out the window.  The other
woman, who wears a kerchief over her hair, packs thick
powder and make-up paint on her face.

                   THE OTHER WOMAN
                  (in a gruff voice)
          How do I look?

It's Madmartigan!  Willow pops up like a jack-in-the-
box.

                        WILLOW
          You!!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Where the hell did you come from?

Willow strides toward Madmartigan, holding the baby
like a machine gun.

                        WILLOW
          I trusted you...

The brownies peek out.

                         ROOL
          Who's he?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're crawling with rodents.

The bedroom door explodes open.  In storms a big, mean,
half-drunk raging lug named LLUG.

                         LLUG
          Where is he!!

Madmartigan wraps a muffler around his throat.  The
wench innocently curtsies.

                         WENCH
          There's nobody here except me and
          my, um, cousin.

Llug knocks his wife out of the way and glares susi-
ciously at Madmartigan, who bats his heavily made-up
eyelashes.  He speaks in a high feminine voice.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          How do you do.

Llug sniffs at Madmartigan then fixes his gaze on
Madmartigan's flat chest.  He goes to squeeze him
there, but Madmartigan ducks out of the way and
snatches the baby from Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Hey!  Give me that baby!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          These Pecks make terrible nurse-
          maids.

                        WILLOW
          Nursemaid?!

Willow angrily jumps up and down, swiping at the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          They get too excited.

With a swing of the hip, Madmartigan butts Willow aside
and maternally puts the baby against his chest.  Llug
houd-dogs him around the room, finally cornering him
and staaring lecherously into his eyes.

                         LLUG
          Wanna breeeeeeed?


Madmartigan protects himself by holding the baby up in
front of his face.  Then he smells the baby.  He winces
and groans.

                        WILLOW
                   (mischievously)
          Time to change her diaper.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time to leave.

Madmartigan throws open the door and dashes out.  But
he doesn't get very far.  Several NOCKMAAR SOLDIERS
push him back in.  Then they grab madmartigan and Wil-
low, and Llug and his wife, and haul them all outside.

INT. TAVERN - HALLWAY - DAY

Madmartigan is slammed against a wall.  The Willow.
Then Llug and his wife.  In the b.g. Nockmaar troops
are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from
frightened mothers and inspecting them.

Heavy bootsteps thud toward them.  Willow looks out and
recognizes Sorsha, the black-helmeted knight from the
bridge.

                        SORSHA
          You!  Are you the mother of that
          child?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No.
           (looks at Llug; in a high voice)
          I mean yes.

Sorsha strides over to Madmartigan, her sword drawn.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Let me see it.

                        WILLOW
          No!  You can't!

Madmartigan looks at Willow then back at Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          I can't.

                        SORSHA
          Why not?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Willow)
          Why not?

                        WILLOW
          Because she's sick.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (to Sorsha)
          Because she's sick.

                        SORSHA
          Give it to me!

Sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike.
She grabs for the baby.  Instinctively, Madmartigan el-
bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off-
balance against a nearby bench.  The soldiers tense up,
pointing their swords and spears.

Sorsha regains her balance.  She rips off her black
helmet.  Long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders.
She is a young woman, and Madmartigan's eyes pop open.
He does his best to keep up his femal facade.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (high voice)
          Gawd...you're...beautiful...

                        SORSHA
          You're not a woman.

Sorsha comes right up to Madmartigan, squinting into
his eyes.  The she rips away his kerchief and muffler.

                         LLUG
          Not a woman??!!

All hell breaks loose.  Llug charges for Madmartigan's
throat.  Madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and
dashes right out the window.  Llug bulldozes Sorsha and
her Lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage
of the chaos and stampede for the stairs.  Willow dives
out the window after Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          After them!!

She grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who
clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their
way.

EXT. ROADSIDE TAVERN - DAY

Madmartigna jumps off the upstairs balcony and lands in
the wagon below.  The two iron-workers look up with
concern.  Then they react with surprise as Madmartigan
rips away his disguise.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Wait!

Up above, Willow charges along the balcony.  Madmarti-
gan juggles the baby and whips the reins.  The wagon
pulls away, iron-workers scrambling after it.  Willow
flings himself off the balcony.  The brownies tumble
out of his pocket.  They all land in the back of the
wagon as it takes off.

It has stopped raining.  In the stable under the
tavern, horses smash together and people fall in the
mud, and the Nockmaar soldiers get tangled up in the
traffic jam.

EXT. ROAD - CHASE - DAY

As Madmartigan lashes the horse, Willow crawls up to
hum and takes the baby.

                        WILLOW
          We could've been killed, Madmarti-
          gan!

In the back, the brownies boucne all over the place
amid wooden kegs and other objects.  When they finally
get their balane they look back in alarm.

Chasing them are two Nockmaar HORSEMEN plus a DEATH DOG
and a war chariot.

Willow ducks low and peeks out, protectively hugging
the baby.  The wagon bounces and flies along, but the
minions are quickly gaining.  Rool and Teemo spring
into action.  They struggle with all their might and
manage to kck small wooden kegs off the back of the
wagon.

The kegs bounce onto the road, and the minions lose
some ground trying to avoid them.  But soon the horse-
men flank the wagon.  One leaps off his galloping horse
and climbs on board.  The other draws an arrow and gets
ready to fire.

Madmartigan is about to be shot between the eyes.  He
quickly rolls into the back.  The archer firse! and
hits the other minion in the chest.  Madmartigna snaps
a wooden stake off the wagon side and smashes
the wounded minion off the wagon:  he crashes onto the
road.

Willow harnesses the papoose to his chest and grabs the
reins.  At the same time the minion archer leaps
aboard.  He and Madmartigan fight in the back.

                        WILLOW
          Heeyah!  Heeyah!

Then there's a terrible howl right beside Willow.  The
Death Dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and
trying to board.  Willow yanks the reins and swerves
the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously.  In the
back, Madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the
swerving jolt.

                        WILLOW
          Oh no!

Up ahead Willow sees an exposed tree root in the road.
The wagon is headed straight for it!  The wheel hits
the root hard and Willow is dumped onto the wagon floor
and very nearly goes overboard.

In the back, Madmartigan and the minion keep fighting
as the wagon clatter along out of control.  The Death
Dog catches up again and this time spring aboard.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

The dog snaps at the baby.  Willow scurries under the
wagon seat.  The dog stands up on its hind feet.

                         DEATH
          Bordak!!

It gets ready to attack.  But WHACK! an overhanging
tree branch hits it and Willow looks up from under the
seat and sees the mangled dog twitching and dangling
from the tree, rapidly disappearing in the distance.

In the back, meanwhile, the minion draws a knife.  Mad-
martigan ducks out of his way, hanging onto a post at
the edge of the tailgate.  The minion comes after him.

Suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off.
The jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan
kicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but
holds on, dragged by the wagon.

Rool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large
wooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and
sending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up
in horror as the heavy keg crushes him.

But the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along
with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins
and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them
is the war chariot!

The Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the
reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to
twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his
head.

Madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post.
The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK!
It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the
chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up
each other.  At last Madmartigan lets go of the post
and the chariot driver is sent tumbling through the
airl, over a cliff to his death.

                        WILLOW
          Woah...woah...!

Willow tries to stop the horse.  But the wheel col-
lapses and he is thrown off into a ditch.  The brownies
dive overboard.  Madmartigan jumps off and delibrerately
sends the wagon up the road.  He scrambles down into
the ditch and lies flat beside Willow.

Suddenly, hoofbeats thunder and Sorsha and the rest of
her troops gallop past.  Lying flat, Madmartigna raises
his head and sees Sorsha's long flowing red hair.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          That girl is a vision.

As soon as the troops are gone, Willow jumps up.

                        WILLOW
          Where's the baby??

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I thought you had her!

                      ROOL/TEEMO
          Willow!!

The brownies are waving and gesturing madly, pointing
at a heap of boards and rubble that broke off the
wagon.  Willow and Madmartigan race over and start dig-
ging, flinging debris aside.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now Willow, I know you're gonna
          blame me for this but it wasn't my
          fault...!

                        WILLOW
          Elora Danan!

Willow sees the battered, lifeless papoose.  He grabs
it and rips it open.  Madmartigan kneels in the dirt
remorsefully.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          When I left the crossroads, I got
          ambushed by an elf!

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  You saved her life!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I did?

Willow holds up the baby.  She giggles and smiles.
Madmartigan switches gears, boasting:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I mean, of course I saved her life.
          She's almost my daughter, isn't
          she?

Willow bundles the baby and looks up the road.

                        WILLOW
          Let's get out of here before they
          come back.

They hurry off into the darkening woods.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

A campfire blazes.  Willow tends the baby while the
brownies point up at the stars.

                         TEEMO
          Northeast is that way.  We've come
          west and south.  I think.

Madmartigan dumps a big log on the fire, spraying the
brownies with sparks.

                         ROOL
          Watch it!  You're gonna set us on 
          fire.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not a bad idea.

Madmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick.  Then
he squats beside Willow and the baby.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So you're on your way to Tir
          Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you
          this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't
          exist.

                        WILLOW
          Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          The Fairy Queen?  And the baby
          here's a princess?  And these two
          rodents are your guides?

He shakes his head sceptically, stretches out and puts
his feet up on a log.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah well...in the morning I think
          I'll be on my way.

He laughs sarcastically.  Willow sets down the baby.  He
takes off Kiaya's necklace and fingers it sadly.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, I need your help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My help?  A great magician like
          you?  You don't need any help.

Willow stares at him angrily.

                        WILLOW
          But you're a great swordsman!

He jumps and starts pacing around the fire.  Rool and
Teemo dive for cover.

                        WILLOW
                      (explodes)
          You're not a warrior, Madmartigan!
          A warrior wouldn't lie there and do
          nothing!

He kicks Madmartigan's boot and knocks his feet off the
log.

                        WILLOW
          We're in trouble!  You've seen the
          big army that's after us!  You're a
          fake!  You're a bum!  You're a--
          you're a coward!!

He picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire,
sending up a shower of sparks.  Madmartigan eyes him
with concern.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What's with you, Peck?

Willow lets it all pour out.  He begins to cry.

                        WILLOW
          I miss my wife!  I miss my chil-
          dren!  My boy Ranon!  He's growing
          up so fast, he even helps me on the
          farm now!  And little Mims!  If you
          ever saw her sweet little face
          you'd *melt* Madmartigan, you'd
          *melt*!
                      (sniffles)
          Or maybe you wouldn't.  You don't
          know anything about love.  You
          don't know anything about any-
          thing...

Willow sits on the ground, exhausted.  Madmartigan
picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I was in love once, Willow.  She
          had a hold on my heart.  I could
          barely function.
                       (a pause)
          I *was* a great swordsman!  I was
          knighted!  I could have been king!

                        WILLOW
          You?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed
          me.  She robbed me of my dream.

Madmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the
fire.  Willow watches him curiously.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'll never fall in love again...

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

Willow wakes up and looks around.  The baby is gone.
He panics.  He scrambles a short distance through
some bushes.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  Madmartigan!

They've been camped all night near the shore of a LAKE.
Willow finds Madmartigan and the baby bathing happily
in the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Relax, Willow.  We're having fun.

The baby squeals with delight as Madmartigan twirls her
around.  He lifts her yp and carries her to Willow on
the shore.  The brownies crawl thorugh the bushes.
Rool points out at the lake.

                         ROOL
          That's it!  The sorceress lives
          there!

In the middle of the lake is an island with a single
tree.

                         TEEMO
          Are you sure?

                         ROOL
                       (excited)
          Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on
          that island!

Madmartigan lets out a sarcastic, sceptical laugh.
Teemo scratches his head and squints out at the island.

                         TEEMO
          That tree dosn't look like gold to
          me.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Gold!!

Madmartigan rubs his chin with sudden interest.

                         TEEMO
          Its branches are supposed to be
          made of gold, solid gold.

                        WILLOW
          How are we going to get out there?

Madmartigan is suddenly pacing and thinking.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll find a way, Willow.  Look
          over there--that looks like a
          village--maybe they've got a boat.
          Come on, what are you waiting for?

Madmartigan runs along the shore toward a small village
in the distance.

EXT. DESERTED FISHING VILLAGE - DAY

Half a dozen decrepit huts sit rotting on the edge of
the lake.  There are no inhabitants, just a lot of dis-
carded junk, including a few battered fishing boats.
But Madmartigan, keeping one eye on the gold tree out
on the island, is undaunted.  He rummages through the
debris, hauling out a fishing boat and shouldering it
toward the water.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Give me a hand here, Peck!

Willow hoists the baby into the papoose and helps Mad-
martigan.

                          BOY
          What are you doing?

They turn around.  A golden-haired BOY is standing
waist-deep in th elake.  Madmartigan is instantly wary
of him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          It's nothing to do with you.

But the boy looks innocent and harmless, and Willow ap-
proaches him.

                        WILLOW
          We need to get out to that island.

                          BOY
          The island is cursed.

Madmartigan scoffs at this nonsense, grunting and push-
ing the boat into the water.

                        WILLOW
          We've traveled a long way.  We're
          looking for Fin Raziel.

                         TEEMO
          The sorceress.

                          BOY
          She's there.  But you can't go
          there.  The island is cursed.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (no patience)
          Yeah?  Who cursed it?

                          BOY
          Queen Bavmorda.  Her powers govern
          the elements.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Ahh, he's trying to protect the
          gold.  Come on, Willow.  Jump in.

Madmartigan climbs into the boat and grabs an oar,
eager to go.  Willow looks down at the brownies for
help.

                        WILLOW
          What would the Fairy Queen say?

                         ROOL
          She's not here.

                         TEEMO
                       (to Rool)
          Obviously.

                        WILLOW
          Without Raziel we'll never find Tir
          Asleen.
                      (decision)
          We'd better go.

Willow marches to the boat.  Calmly accepting their
choice, the golden-haired boy dives into the lake and
disappears.  Willow and the brownies board the boat,
and Madmartigan poles them away from the shore.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

They row across the placid lake toward the island.

EXT. ISLAND - DAY

They climb onto the rocky shore.  Flies buzz and swarm
around them, and creepy bugs crawl around their feet.
Broken skeletons litter the shore.  Handing the baby
back and forth, Willow and Madmartigan claw their way
up to the large tree.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Hello?  Fin Raziel?

Madmartigan greedily reaches up to touch a branch.

                        RAZIEL
          Get away!  Get away!

A littel animal scurries down the tree and hisses vi-
ciously at Madmartigan, chattering its teeth.

                        RAZIEL
          You'll die!  You'll die!

RAZIEL scampers over to Willow.  Her voice screeches
like a parrot.  She looks like an otter with a bush
tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Who are you!  Who are you!

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to
          find Fin Raziel.

She springs right onto Willow's chest.

                        RAZIEL
          That's me!  Raziel!  Raziel!

Willow looks down at the browines questioninghly.

                        WILLOW
          This can't be right.  This isn't a
          sorceress.  This is some kind of
          animal.

                         TEEMO
          Queen Bavmorda transformed her.

                        RAZIEL
          What do you want!

                        WILLOW
          We need your help.  To take this
          baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin-
          cess.

Still sceptical, Willow shows Raziel the baby's mark.
Raziel shoots up onto a branch and frantically flicks
her tail.

                        RAZIEL
          Elora Danan!

Madmartigan snaps a branch off the tree.  A flock of
birds suddenly screech and fly away.  His eyes bulge.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Rool!  Teemo!  You were right!
          This whole tree is made of gold!!

He strips away the bark, revealing a vein of gold.

                        RAZIEL
          Fools!  You should never have come
          to this place!  We're all going to
          die!

The wind begins to blow and the sky darkens.  Raziel
zips over to Willow and whispers intensely.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got to get off this island
          right now.  Hurry!  The boat!  It's
          our only chance!

The wind howls.  they hurry down to the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!

Madmartigan is greedily breaking branches off the tree.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Wait!  Gold!  Gold!

Waves lash at the boat as they jump aboard.  Madmarti-
gan loads up with branches.  As they push off, he
scrambles down the rocks.  Just in time he jumps into
the boat as the storm swirls it out into the frothy
lake.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Willow clutches the baby as the raging storm pitches
the boat.

                        WILLOW
          Help, Madmartigan!  The oar!

Madmartigan hangs onto his gold, but pices of it drop
and topple overboard.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          My gold!

Suddenly a hand appears on the stern.  The water boy
climbs in.

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

                        WILLOW
          No!

                        RAZIEL
          Kill him!

Madmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back
into the lake.  The boy surfaces like a dolphin.  His
shape begins to change, becoming fish-like, diving and
vanishing.

Then:  he attacks the boat!  He is now a ferocious
shark-like monster.  He chomps the boat and the gold
branches slide into the water.  Madmartigan bashes the
monster with the oar, then grabs an anchor.  The mon-
ster attacks again and Madmartigan jabs its gill with
the anchor.

The monster sinks into the lake.  They all sigh with
relief.  Madmartigan shrugs proudly.  Suddenly the an-
chor line unravels, tangling Madmartigan's legs in
fishing nets and yanking him overboard.

Underwater, Madmartigan swirls behind the monster.  He
pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts
himself free with his dagger.

He surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat.
Willow reaches out to him.  The monster surfaces and
circles the boat.  Then it attacks Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          No!!  Help!!  Willow!!!

Willow digs out a magic acorn.  But he drops it!  He
fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it.  The
monster opens its jaws and goes to devour Madmartigan.
Willow throws the acorn.

The monster miraculously turns to stone.  Madmartigan
grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster
sinks.  Willow hauls him into the boat.

EXT. LAKESHORE - DAY

The storm begins to die down as they jump to shore, ex-
hausted.  Madmartigan wears nothing now but a ragged
loincloth.  He falls to his knees, coughing and spit-
ting.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...you...you got...magic...!
          Wait...we could team up...!

He pulls himself up and follows Willow.  Suddenly they
all stop.  Sorsha and her men come out of the woods.

                        RAZIEL
          Flee!  Flee!

The brownies scurry into a hole.  Raziel makes a dash
for it but a soldier skewers her tail with his spear,
dangling her in front of Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Raziel.  Did you think my mother
          would allow you to escape?

Sorsha gestures, and the soldier takes Raziel away.
The lieutenant wrestles the baby away from Willow.  He
gives her to Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          This is what we're looking for.  It
          bears the markings.

Willow panics.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Don't worry, Willow.  If there's
          one thing I'm good at, it's charm-
          ing a woman...

He swaggers forward.  Sorsha turns and looks at him.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          So.  Couldn't live without me, huh?

Sorsha looks up and down at his naked body.

                        SORSHA
          Lose your skirt?  How embarassing.

Madmartigan looks down and adjusts his loincloth.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Still got what counts.

A pause as he smiles at her.

                        SORSHA
          Not for long.

She raises her fist and zap:  Madmartigan is instantly
surrounded by spears and swords.

                        SORSHA
          We'll join the column.  Bring them
          with us.

Madmartigan and Willow are roughly taken away.  Sorsha
and her troops mount horses and ride off.  Rool and
Teemo crawl lup from under a rock.

                         TEEMO
          We gotta follow them.

                         ROOL
          Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any-
          way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's
          go home.

Rool walks off and Teemo grabs him, yanks him back.

                         TEEMO
          Get back here, Rool!

                         ROOL
          Ouch!  Let go of me!

Rool throws a punch, and the brownies somersault into
the bushes fighting each other.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Sorsha and her men now ride with a caravan of fifty
NOCKMAAR TROOPS.  Chained by their necks.  Willow and
Madmartigan walk behind a wagon.  Raziel sits trapped
in a cage on the back of the wagon.

                        WILLOW
          I can't go on...

Willow loses strength, falls and is dragged.  Madmarti-
gan picks him up and carries him on his shoulders.
Sorsha sees this.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, why don't you use your mag-
          ic to get us out of here?

                        RAZIEL
          He's no magician.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          He turned that monster into stone!

Raziel peers sternly at Willow, who is eye-level with
her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Did *you* give that acorn its power?

                        WILLOW
          No.

                        RAZIEL
          A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool
          can use it.

Madmartigan shakes his head at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Then you get us out of here.

                        RAZIEL
          I will!  But I need help!

                        WILLOW
          I'll help you...!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I won't.

                        RAZIEL
          You must learn magic.

                        WILLOW
          That's all I ever wanted!

                        RAZIEL
          Then I will teach you.

Sorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan, carrying
the baby, who is crying.  Madmartigan, with Willow
still on his shoulders, straightens up and flirts with
her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Nice horse...nice hair...real nice
          hair...I'd say you've got the most
          beautiful hair I've ever--

She flashes her eyes at him.

                        SORSHA
          Wolff wants to boil you in oil.

She nods toward her Lieutenant, who snarls viciously.

                        SORSHA
          Don't tempt me.

She turns away.  The baby squirms and cries.

                        WILLOW
          If you rest the baby on your
          shoulder, she'll stop crying.

                        SORSHA
          Shut up.

Sorsha rides along.  She shifts the baby to her other
shoulder, and she instantly stops crying.  Sorsha
throws a look at Willow.  Madmartigan takes a long deep
breath.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.

                        SORSHA
                    (angry threat)
          My step-father's going to tear you
          apart.

Madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm torn apart already.  I mean it!
          Under all that armor is a 
          beautiful--

CRACK!  Sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Who is that girl, anyway?

                        RAZIEL
          Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.

Madmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Forget that one, Madmartigan.

Raziel leaps against the bars of her cage, chatters her
teeth and whispers to Willow.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow.  To learn magic, first you 
          must make your own philosopher's
          stone!

                        WILLOW
          What do I need for that?

                        RAZIEL
          We must start with feathers, dung,
          and a lock of your hair.

Willow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his
eyes and frowns at it.  Madmartigan, meanwhile, can't
take his eyes off Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Now that's a woman...!

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Fires and torches burn around pitched tents.  Soldiers
eat and drink, and meat is thrown out to Death Dogs.
From her cage, Raziel looks down at Willow, still
chained to the wagon next to Madmartigan.  Willow is
grinding a substance with a rock.

                        RAZIEL
          Keep working at it.  Forget all you
          know, or think you know.  A
          magician's power depends on disord-
          er of the mind.

She twists her head through the bars.  Madmartigan
squints up at her.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You got that one covered.

Willow hears the baby crying in a distant tent.

                        WILLOW
          I hope she's all right.  How much
          more do I have to do of this?

                        RAZIEL
          Till it's in a powder.  The energy
          exits within you...

                        WILLOW
                      (reciting)
          I know, and the magician's goal is
          to find his true self.  But what's
          this got to do with it?

                        RAZIEL
          As below, so above.  You hold the
          univers, Willow, in your hand.

Madmartigan clasps his forhead.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm beginning to think you two
          *deserve* to be locked up.

                        WILLOW
          The universe is a living creature,
          like you and me, Madmartigan.

Madmartigan cynically gazes at the sky, gesturing wide-
ly.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're a tiny version of all that?

                        RAZIEL
          As above, so below.

Madmartigan rolls his eyes.  Willow jumps to his feet
and shows Raziel the substance.

                        WILLOW
          I'm all finished.  Now what?

                        RAZIEL
          Burn it to a fine ash.

Willow looks around.  Heavily armed Nockmaar minions
rip chunks of meat around a campfire.

                        WILLOW
          How am I gonna do that?

                        RAZIEL
          Patience.  Concentrate.  You will
          find a way.

Suddenly bootsteps clomp toward them.  Willow quickly
folds the powder inside some cloth and hides it in his
pocket.  The Lieutenant marches up and scrutinizes them
suspiciously.  He abruptly snatches Willow up, hacks
the chain and drags him off.

                        WILLOW
          What's going on?

Madmartigan sturggles against his chains.  Angry and
worried:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurt him and you'll answer to me!

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - NIGHT

The Lieutenant clamps irons on Willow's wrists, flings
him into a tent and exits.  Willow looks up and sees
Sorsha, still in her uniform, impatiently pacing wiht
the crying baby.

                        SORSHA
          This baby won't do what I say.  You
          seem to know what to do.  Here!
          Make it shut up.

Sorsha dumps the baby in Willow's arms and then backs
away.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed.

                        SORSHA
          I changed her already!

Willow politely shrugs.

                        WILLOW
          She needs to be changed again.
Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow
changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re-
lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror.
Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the
fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.

                        SORSHA
          Who is that horrible friend of
          yours?

                        WILLOW
                  (watching the fire)
          Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Who is he?

                        WILLOW
          I don't know much about him.

Sorsha fiddles with her long red hair.  Willow creeps
toward the fire.

                        SORSHA
          He's very bold.  Do you really
          think my hair is beautiful?

She turns and looks right at Willow.  He looks back.
She asks the question again by holding out strands of
her hair.

                        WILLOW
          Uh, yes.  It's very nice hair.

He suddenly strides over to Sorsha.

                        WILLOW
          She's hungry.

                        SORSHA
          I know she's hungry.  I tried to
          feed her but she wouldn't eat a
          thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.

                        WILLOW
          Here.  Hold her.

He hands Sorsha the baby, then goes to the fire where
there's a stone crock of milk.  He carefully takes his
cloth pouch out of his pocket and unfolds it.  At the
other side of the tent Sorsha awkwardly paces with the
baby.

                        SORSHA
          I tried everything.  A spoon.  I
          poured milk into her mouth, she just
          spat it out.  I don't know what to
          do, I'm not a mother.

During this, Willow ignites his powdery substance.  It
flares slightly then burns to an ash.  He gathers it
up, then returns to Sorsha with the milk.

                        WILLOW
          Sometimes she likes it heated.

Willow finds a strip of cloth, dips it in the milk, and
feeds Elora Danan in Sorsha's arms.  He looks up at
Sorsha and smiles.

                        WILLOW
          She's a good baby.

Sorsha looks down at the baby.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CAMPSITE - MORNING

The caravan packs up to move on.  Soldiers drag Willow
to the wagon and lift him on board, chaining him beside
Raziel's cage.  Willow excitedly pats his pocker, and
whispers:

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  I got the ashes!

When the soldiers leave, he digs out the pouch and
proudly shows it to Raziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Good!  The first step is complete.

Chained behind the wagon, Madmartigan reaches forward
and pokes Willow with his finger?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Did she ask about me?

                        WILLOW
          Who?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard
          time.  You were in her ten all
          night.  Did she say anything?

Willow deliberately plays innocent.

                        WILLOW
          She said lots of thing.s

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!

Willow grins.  At last:

                        WILLOW
          She asked about you, Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Well what did she say?

Suddenly Sorsha gallops by on horseback, holding the
baby.  She flings a wad of clothes at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          Here.  You're going to need these
          where we're going.

She rides off.  Madmartigan looks down at the clothes.
The looks at Willow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's in love.

                        WILLOW
          You're crazy.  I think you're in
          love.

EXT. SNOW MOUNTAIN - DAY

The Nockmaar caravan climbs into snow-covered moun-
tains.  In the wagon, Raziel is grilling Willow.  He
concentrates hard, cramming, memorizing, straining.

                        RAZIEL
          We don't have much time left!  Go
          on!  Go on!

                        WILLOW
          I must concetrate my
          imagination...to creat a
          new...reality!

                        RAZIEL
          What's the magician's weapon?

                        WILLOW
          The limitless power of...

Raziel flips around in spasms of impatience.

                        RAZIEL
          Your will!  Your will!  What else
          could it be?

                        WILLOW
                     (frustrated)
          I can't remember all these things.
          What am I learning?

                        RAZIEL
          The art of transformation!


                        WILLOW
                     (exasperated)
          But what am I gonna transform??

                        RAZIEL
          Me!

Willow and Madmartigan stare at Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          You?

                     MADMARTIGAN
          What are you gonna become, Raziel?
          Queen of the rodents?

Sorsha rides up to the wagon.

                        SORSHA
          The baby's cold.  Take her.

She dismounts.  With care, keeping the baby bundled,
she hands the baby to Willow.  Madmartigan watches and
listens.

                        RAZIEL
          You remind me of your father, Sor-
          sha.

                        SORSHA
          My father was a weakling.

                        RAZIEL
          He was a great king.
                 (Madmartigan reacts)
          Not like your step-father, not like
          your mother.  He ruled Tir Asleen
          with kindness, and a generous
          heart.

                        SORSHA
          My mother calls that weakness.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          What do *you* call it?

Sorsha turns and glares at Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I do what I'm told.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Too bad you're not more like
          your father.

She looks at him a moment, then abruptly mounts her
horse and rides ahead.

EXT. ROAD TOWARD SNOW CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

The caravan rides toward a large Nockmaar camp.  Death
Dogs howl and fires burn ominously in the distance.
Willow and madmartigan watch as KING KAEL rides out to
meet the caravan.

Kael is huge, powerful and cruel, partbeast, part man,
and he carries a terrible sword at his side.  Sorsha
carefully shows him the baby.  He grabs it from her.

                        SORSHA
          Be careful.

                         KAEL
          Don't tell me what to do.

Kael viciously hits Sorsha, knocking her off her horse.
Madmartgian and Willow watch angrily.  Kail gallops to-
ward camp with the baby under his ar.  Sorsha shakes
away the pain and, humiliated, mounts her horse.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We gotta get the baby out of here.

Raziel dashes around her cage.

                        RAZIEL
          Tonight!  Complete the
          philosopher's stone!  I must be
          turned back!

Looking off into the camp, angry and resolute, Willow
takes out the ingredients for the stone.

                        WILLOW
          I'll do it, Raziel...

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT

Now in a kind of portable cell, Madmartigan clutches
the jail bars and looks out at the camp.  Fires and
torches burn, and Nockmaar soldiers patrol.

Shivering cold, willow sits cross-legged in the jail,
melting snow into a bowl.  On a nearby lean-to, where
skins and shields are kept, Raziel hangs in her cage.

Somewhere the baby is crying.  In the distance Sorsha
goes inside one of the tenst. There's a muffled yel-
ling between Sorsha and Kael.  Then Keal storms out of
the tent and goes inside the tent next door.

Willow pours the ashes into the melted snow.

                        RAZIEL
          Let it settle.  Carefully, slowly.
          Concentration and will.  Now pour
          the water off.

As Willow works, Madmartigan binds together scrap
sticks of wood, making a long pole.  He gingerly hooks
Raziel's cage with this, lifting it from the spike.

                        WILLOW
          Oooh, this smells terrible.

                        RAZIEL
          That's the life spark.  Exxence of
          magic and sorcery!

Madmartigan angles the pole and the cage slide toard
him.  He grabs it with both hands and rips it apart.
Raziel right away scurries down the cell bars, jumps
into the jail and bits Willow's hand.

                        WILLOW
          Ouch!!

                        RAZIEL
          Shhhhh!

They look out nervously at patrolling Nockmaar sol-
diers.  Willow sucks the back of his hand.

                        WILLOW
          What'd you bit me for!!

                        RAZIEL
          We need blood.  To nourish the
          stone.  charge the stone with ener-
          gy.

Willow drips his blood into the concoction then stirs
it with a twig.  It begins to glow from within.

                        RAZIEL
          The components of the stone are
          fusing...

Willow's eyes widen with anticipation.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - NIGHT - LATER

Fires have burned down.  Most of the camp is sleeping.
It is nearing dawn.  Madmartigan stares out at Sorsha's
tent, deep in thought.  Willow holds up the completed
PHILOSOPHER'S STONE, a red ball of pliable putty.

                        RAZIEL
          Again:  what is the magician's
          weapon?

                        WILLOW
          His will.

                        RAZIEL
          Now use it.

Willow presses the philopher's stone against the
chainlock.  He sheepishly looks over his hsoulder at
Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I just wanted to test it first.

                        RAZIEL
          No!  Change me back into a sor-
          ceress, Willow.

Willow goes to Raziel and concentrates with physical
and mental intensity.

                        WILLOW
          Avaggdu, supriom, luwatha...

It starts to work.  Raziel curls into a ball of fur.
The fur changes to feathers.  She begins to squawk
strangely.  She emerges as a raven-sized bird.

                        WILLOW
          What did I do?

He sags with exhaustion and massages his blistered
hands.  Then: CLINK!  The lock falls open.  They all
look over, and Madmartigan picks it up off the ground.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Not bad, Peck.  I'm impressed.  You
          busted the lock.

Wilow clutches Madmartigan's arm.  He holds up the
stone.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan.  Let's go.  Let's get
          Eloran Danan.

With coldness in his eyes, madmartigan stares across
the camp at Sorsha's tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Let's get Elora Danan.

They sneak away.

                        RAZIEL
          Wait!  What about me!

Raziel flaps her wings and flies up into the dark sky.

EXT. THROUGH THE CAMP - DAWN

Willow and Madmartigan sneak behind tents, hiding from
the patrolling guards.  Very quietly they creep up to
Kael's tent.  Madmartigan knocks out a guard and steals
his knife.  They crawl dangerously over to Sorsha's
tent.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You're a magician, Willow.  But I'm
          a thief.  Wait here.  I'll get the
          baby.

Madmartigan slits the back of the tent open and slips
inside.  Raziel flutters down and lands on Willow's
shoulder.

                        RAZIEL
          I'm supposed to be a beautiful wo=
          man.

Willow shrugs apologetically.

INT. SORSHA'S TENT - DAWN

Crouched inside the large tent, Madmartigan calculates
his next move.  In the far corner, Sorsha lies asleep.
He steals the baby from a crib of straw.  Starts to
leave.  But stops.  Willow pokes his head inside.

                        WILLOW
                      (whispers)
          Come on, Madmartigan...!

Madmartigan stares over at Sorsha.  Lured by her beau-
ty, he slowly walks toward her bed.

                        WILLOW
          What are you doing?  Get out of
          there...!

Madmartigan looks down at her.  Morning rushlight il-
luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is
spread across her pillow.  Out of her armor, in soft
nightclothes, she looks like a goddess.  Upon her
breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels.
Quietly:

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I love you.

He kisses her lips.  Her eyes open.

                        SORSHA
          One move, and you really will be a
          woman.

Holding the baby, Madmartigan does not move a muscle.
Sorsha holds a knife at his crotch.

                        SORSHA
          You're a fool.  Now put her back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I'm not going to let this baby die.

Sorsha presses the knife.

                        SORSHA
          Don't make me kill you.

Willow watches as Madmartigna carefully backs away from
Sorsha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I believe you would...

Sitting up, Sorsha waves her knife.  Madmartigan places
the baby in the straw crib.

                        SORSHA
          Why did you say that?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Say what?

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Madmartigan walks back to Sorsha' bed.  Willow crawls
into the tent, behind Madmartigan's back.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Because it's true.

                        SORSHA
          I don't believe you.

Sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as Madmartigan
walks toward her.  He shows no fear of her knife, com-
pelled instead by honest passion.  For once, he isn't
conning anybody.  His feelings are genuine.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I wish it weren't true.  I swore
          I'd never let this happen.  I hate
          you.  I hate your beauty, I hate
          your innocence, I hate the feelings
          you've awakened in me.

The knife trembles in Sorsha's hand.

                       MADMARTIGAN
          I'm in love with you, Sorsha.  I
          don't want to be, but a power has
          enchanted me and I stand helpless
          against it.  It's torture.  Battle-
          field or prison cell was never half
          as cruel.

He kneels onto her bed.  Her hand falls, her knife
falls to the floor, her chest heaves with fear and emo-
tion.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          I want you and I can't have you so
          I want you all the more.  If this
          were another time and another place
          I'd--

He stops.  He looks into her eyes.  Willow dashes out of
the tent with the baby.

                        SORSHA
          You'd what?

Madmartigan takes Sorsha in his arms and kisses her.
Her trembling body surrenders to him.  Until:

They hear a SCREAM outside the tent.  It all happens
quickly.  Kael rips open the canvas and catches them in
their embrace.  In one hand he holds the baby.  In the
other hand:  Willow.

                         KAEL
          What's going on here!!

Sorsha sees the baby, sees the empty crib, and smashes
Madmartigan hard across the face.

                        SORSHA
          Deceiver!!

Kael hurls Willow across the tent and tosses the baby
in the straw.  Growling horribly he lunges at Madmarti-
gan.  Madmartigan rolls away and sees Sorsha's sword
nearby.  Grabs it.  As Kael draws his sword, Madmarti-
gan artfully slices away the center pole, and the en-
tie tent collapses.

EXT. SNOW CAMP - MORNING

Bodies writhe under the fallen mass of canvas, and Ra-
ziel hovers and screeches above.  Then, a silver blade
slits through the tent, and out jumps Madmartigan
wielding Sorsha's sword.

Alarm!  Nockmaar soldiers and Death Dogs charge across
the snow.  Madmartigan battles them with incredible
skill, backing toward the mountain slope.

Wilow crawls out from under the corner of the tent,
clutchign the baby.  Madmartigan kills several so-
diers, littering the snow with bodies and weapons.
Willow reacts, impressed by Madmartigan's swordsman-
ship.  Madmartigan makes the mistake of acknowledging
it:  he bows, prod and cocky.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whoops!

He slips on the ice and catches himself.  Nearby a
shield skids off along the snow.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Jump on the shiled!

Kael howls and thrashes inside the collapsed tent.
Then he gashes it open with his huge black sword.  He
sees Willow and the baby get on the large shield.

                         KAEL
          Bowmen!  Horses!  After them!

Madmartigan runs toward the shield.  Archers draw their
bows.  Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha beside Kael.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  I didn't betray you.  I
          love you!

As arrows rain down around him, Madmartigan leaps onto
the shield behind Wuillow.  Sorsha watches them as they
slide away down the mountain, Raziel flapping and
shrieking overhead.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!!

Kael waves his sward and a crack squad of Nockmaar
HORSEMEN gallop down the mountain after the sled-
shield.

EXT. DOWN THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN - DAY

Willow hugs the baby while he sits between
Madmartigan's legs, and the shield zooms down the moun-
tain, zig-zagging through trees.  Madmartigan steers by
using Sorsha's sword as a ski pole.

The Nockmaar horsemen gallop after them.

The shield skips and flies over snowdrifts and bumps.
Raziel squawks in terror above them.  Just missing
trees and rocks, they pick up speek.  Their eyes sud-
denly widen.  Dead ahead is a huge wall of ice!

                        WILLOW
          Nooo!!!

Willow shuts his eyes.  the shield speeds toward the
wall.  At the last moment Madmartigan steers them into
a small opening, little more than a crack.  Raziel,
nearly smashing into the wall herself, soars up into
the sky and loses them.

INT. ICE TUNNEL - DAY

They slide and sway down a long tube of ice, picking up
incredible speed until they loop 360 degrees upside-
down and around and go shooting out a hole at the other
end.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

They soar thorugh the air.  Madmartigan and Willow
shriek in terror.  But Elora Danan giggles:  she's hav-
ing fun!  But in the air the shield goes one way and
they go another, flipping and hanging onto one another
and landing on soft snow with a fffump.  Inertia keeps
them rolling.

Clumped together, they tumble down the mountain, gath-
ering snaw as they go, bouncing and rolling into a
snowball that gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger and bigger!

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The snowball steamrolls toward a small village at the
foot of the mountain.  CHLDREN look up and squeal with
delight while the adult VILLAGERS run for their lives.

It plows through the middle of the village, scattering
peole and animals left and right.  At last it smashes
against a stone house and cracks open like an egg.

Raziel flies down and lands on top of the snowball,
flapping her wings frantically.  madmartigan crawls out
as the villagers rush up.  They stand back in amaze-
ment:  the baby starts crying.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!  Are you all
          right?

Madmartigan drags Willow and the baby out of the snow.
Willow's body is limp, he's unconscious.  Then a VIL-
LAGER points up at the mountain.

                       VILLAGER
          King Kael!

                   ANOTHER VILLAGER
          Nockmaar troops!

                      MADMARTIGAN
                    (to villagers)
          Help us.

In the distance Kael and his squad of about 15 horsemen
charge toward the village.  The villagers flee into
their huts and houses.  Madmartigan scoops up Willow
and the baby.  Some villagers usher them around a
corner and into a house just as Kael's army invades the
town.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Madmartigan is bustled underground thorugh a cellar
into a hidden storage room and a disguised door shuts
behind him.  MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN huddle here in
silence, like refugees or criminals.  Madmartigan hands
the crying baby to a WOMAN then lays Willow on the
floor.  Suddenly a huge hand clamps his shoulder:  his
old friend and rival Airk Thaughbaer.

                         AIRK
          Madmartigan.  Settled down with a
          family huh?

Madmartigan knocks Airk's hand away.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You left me to die, friend.

                         AIRK
          You managed alright.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Is this what's left of your army?

Among the refugees is a handful of war-battered WARRI-
ORS.  One of them, an OFFICER looks out through the
ceiling beams.

                        OFFICER
          Keep that baby quiet.

They hear hoofbeats outside.  Airk gives Madmartigan a
flask of whiskey.  He squirts whiskey into Willow's
mouth and Willow coughs and shudders awake.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

Raziel flies onto a rooftop and looks down.  Nockmaar
soldiers flood the village, dismounting, kicking down
doors, searching houses.  Then Raziel sees Kael riding
alongside Sorsha.

In her armor, at a distance, Sorsha looks fierce.  But
CLOSER her eyes show confusion, hesitation.  Kael
watches her closely as he waves his sword at the vil-
lage.

                         KAEL
          Where is it!  Tell us or we'll burn
          your village!  Sorsha!

He shakes her roughly.  She dismounts.  Raziel watches
as Sorsha and two other soldiers enter the house where
Madmartigan and Willow are hiding.

INT. HOUSE CELLAR - DAY

Willow holds the baby tight.  Madmartigan, Airk and the
Officer watch through the cracks.  Boots pound above,
shaking dust down on them.  A door opens.

Nobody breathes.  Willow buries the baby in his chest.
Madmartigan peeks through the door.  Sorsha, alone,
comes down into the cellar.  They see her.  Searching.
Airk's men reach for their swords, begin to draw.
Whisper:

                        OFFICER
          Kill her.

Madmartigam shakes his head.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          You'll draw the others.

Airk looks at Madmartigan curiously.  Madmartigan
watches Sorsha. She is right there, inches away.
Inaudibly, be says her name.  At last she goes back
upstairs.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Sorsha comes up and begins to leave with the other two
soldiers.

INT. CELLAR

In Willow's arms, the baby lets out a cry.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS

Sorsha and the soldiers stop and draw swords.  The
baby's cry is suddenly drowned out by a loud SDRRECH.
Raziel flaps in through a window and flies madly around
the house, cawing and shrieking insanely.  Sorsha and
the soldiers sheathe their swords and leave.

INT. CELLAR

Everyone sighs with relief.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

In the distance the Nockmaar army is setting houses ab-
laze and Kael is terrorizing the fleeing people with
his sword.  Sorsha mounts her horse.  Her attention is
momemtarily caught by a MAN across the street who, from
the back, looks like Madmartigan.  She gasps.  The man
turns around.  She sags with disappointment, spurs her
horse, and rides off.

The deadly squad of Nockmaar horsemen gallops out of
the village.

INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

Madmartigan and Willow come upstairs with Airk and his
men.

                         AIRK
          It's you they're after, Madmarti-
          gan.  What did you do this time?

                      MADMARTIGAN
          They're not after me.  They want
          the baby.

Living in the house is a scrawny, shifty-eyed man named
CUTH.  He watches and listens.

                         AIRK
          Who is this baby?

Willow steps forward, both protective and proud.

                        WILLOW
          The princess, Elora Danan.

They all know of her.  They all sigh with respeck and
awe, and they bow.

                        PEOPLE
          The prophecy has come true.

                         AIRK
          Give her to us.  We'll protect her.

Raziel screeches from a ceiling beam.

                        RAZIEL
          Not safe!  Not safe!

Willow looks up at Raziel hopefully.

                        WILLOW
          We're taking her to Tir Asleen.
          She'll be safe there from
          Bavmorda's powers.

Airk looks up at Raziel.  Then down at Willow.  He
clasps Madmartigan's arm.

                         AIRK
          Tir Asleen is a myth.  It doesn't
          exist.

                        RAZIEL
          It does!  It does!  I will show
          you!

Airk impatiently waves the bird away and shoves Madmar-
tigan in the chest.

                         AIRK
          You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan?
          I've lost half my men fighting
          Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock-
          maar army.  Now you and this Peck,
          and that magpie up in the rafters,
          are gonna take 'em on alone?

                      MADMARTIGAN
                     (challenging)
          Then come with us.

Airk angrily stabs his finger at the floor.

                         AIRK
          The war is here!  In towns and vil-
          lages like this!

Airk crosses his arms and turns his back, looking out
at the burning houses and the suffering families.

                         AIRK
          You're chasing a dream.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Just get me some horses.

Airk glares at him furiously.  Then he kicks open the
door and storms out into the street.  Madmartigan and
Willow hurry after him.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Airk and his men, plus some villagers, watch as Madmar-
tigan mounts a large horse.  Then some villagers help
Willow wiggle up onto a small pony.  They sling the
baby over Willow's back and stuff saddlebags with pro-
visions

                     MADMARTIGAN
          Once again, Airk, we say goodbye.

Sadly and cynically, Airk laughs.

                         AIRK
          One day one of us willl stand on
          the other's grave.

They shake hands ruggedly.  Madmartigan nods at Willow
and they head off.  Airk watches them go, clearly am-
bivalent about staying behind.  They ride up the snowy
slope, Raziel circling above.

WE SEE Cuth.  He scratches his filthy beard.  He sneaks
off through the village, in the direction of the Nock-
maar army.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

Snow circles around them as they climb.  Then, oddly,
the mountain becomes warmer, and the snow melts away.
They reach a slope of dark vitreous lava.

                        RAZIEL
          Nockmaar!  Nockmaar!

Far away, at the top of the mountain, looms the ominous
Catsle of Nockmaar.  The black lava flows from it
like a deadly shadow.

EXT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Their horses rear up as they approach the mouth of the
cave.  Raziel waits for them, circling and cawing.

                        RAZIEL
          This way!  The cave!

They dismount and lead the horses.  But the horses pan-
ic, their frightened neighing voices echoing deep in
the gloomy cave, and they break away and run off.

Willow swallows hard.  He and Madmartigan follow Raziel
inside.

INT. CAVE OF THE EBORSISK - DAY

Daylight is soon replaced by the orange glow of molten
lava.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan!  I can't stand being
          in closed-in places.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Want me to carry Elora?

                        WILLOW
          I'm used to her.  How's she doing?

Willow wears the papoose on his back.  Madmartigan
looks in at the baby's face.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's doing a lot better than we
          are, Peck.

Willow and Madmartigan laugh, which breaks the tension.
Then a geiser of steam hisses near them and a bat
screeches somewhere and the tension's back.  They keep
going.

INT. DEEPER IN THE CAVE

Hot liquid drips from the ceiling.  Hissing steam bub-
bles from the floor.  they go single-file along a ledge
over a foaming lava pit.  Raziel is squawking way ahead
in the distance.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow...this may be a bad time to
          ask this question but...what if
          Raziel's wrong?

                        WILLOW
          She can't be wrong.  She's a very
          very very powerful sorceress.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          She's a bird, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          That's my fault, not hers.  I've
          got to keep practicing.  I'm still
          in the learning stage but magic,
          Madmartigan, requires concentration
          and--

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Watch it!

                        WILLOW
          Ahhh!

Madmartigan lunges and grabs Willow just as he is about
to fall into the lava pit.  He hauls him to safety.
They gasp with relief. Then they head deeper into the
cave.  They stop.  They hear something.  Something
strange.

Then, something moves on the wall.

                        WILLOW
          I hate this.

The cave walls come to life.  Down them crawl ugly ROCK
PUFFERS, pillow-sized wall crabs that screech horribly
like bats.  Madmartigan fights them off with his sword.
The Rock Puffers bloat themselves up, tripling their
size.  Madmartigan stabs one and it hisses away like an
untied balloon.

Suddenly, distant hoofbeats thunder and echo.  Madmar-
tigan flashes his sword and turns around, ready to de-
fend Willow and the baby against the army.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Go, Willow!  Run!  Run!

Willow listens as the hoofbeats get louder and louder.
At last he turns and runs deeper into the cave.  Mad-
martigan waits.

The Nockmaar soldiers, now increased to eighty, come
charging down the cave.  Kael rides in the lead along-
side the turncoat Cuth.  As they gallop along the
ledge, Cuth makes the mistake of crowding Kael, who an-
grily elbos him, horse and all, into the boiling pit.

The army tramples over the Rock Puffers, which explode
underfoot.  Madmartigan braces himself as they stampede
toward him.  But suddenly the horseman all screech
thir horses to a halt.  The horses rear and back away.

Madmartigan stands there, wondering.  Then suddenly a
shadow looms behind him.  He turns.

The EBORSISK roars and the cave shakes and thunders.
It's an enormous two-headed monster that doesn't like
visitors.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow!  Willow!

He looks around frantically.  Willow is nowhere to be
seen.  Then the baby cries out.  Madmartigan sees them,
cowering behind a rock.  He runs toward them.  The
Eborsisk exhales flames over his head.

                         KAEL
          Go after them!

Soldiers obey Kael and go after Madmartigan.  He fights
them, hacking down a few, while a few others are in-
cinerated by the Eborsisk.  Sorsha's horse rears as she
watches Madmartigan battle for his life.  Archers shoot
arrows, which pierce the Eborsisk and make it even an-
grier.

Willow digs one of his magic acorns out of his pocket.
A head of the Eborsisk gnashes at Madmartigan.  Madmar-
tigan looks to Willow for help.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Hurry, Willow!  Throw it!

Willow winds up and throws with all his might.  The
Eborsisk blasts a flame, which startles Willow, wreck-
ing his aim.  Madmartigan's eyes pop open and he ducks
as the acorn whistles by his ear.  The acorn bounces
off a rock and flies back, trickles along the ground
and hits a Nockmaar soldier, who is already dead.  The
soldier's body turns to stone.

                        RAZIEL
          Look out!

One of the Eborsisk's heads lunges toward the baby.
Raziel dives like a rocket and attacks the monster's
eye as Willow whisks the baby away.

Then Madmartigan leaps up on the Eborsisk.  He climbs
up over its flaming head and drives his sword down
through its skull.  The Eborsisk howls horribly and its
wounded head falls.  Madmartigan topples down its back
and leaps onto a horse, knocking its rider off and, all
in one swashbuckling move, scooping Willow and the baby
up onto the back of the horse and galloping away.

                         KAEL
          After them!!

But as his horsement charge forward, the Eborsisk falls
to its knees, half-dead.  The surviving head blasts the
soldiers with fire.  They rear back on their horses and
continue to battle the monster with arrows and spears.

EXT. CAVE - TIR ASLEEN - DAY

They ride out of the mouth of the dark cave into a lush
valley of flowers.  In the distance stands the beau-
tiful CASTLE OF TIR ASLEEN.  Raziel zooms up out of the
cave an flies above them as they gallop fullspeed to-
ward it.  She soars higher and higher and flies right
over the castle wall.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN CASTLE - DAY

The door of the castle is half open.  Madmartigan and
Willow gallop inside.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Raziel flies down to meet them as they ride into the
castle courtyard.  A haunting wind drones amont TWELVE
PILLARS which look like stone from a distance.

                        RAZIEL
          Tir Asleen.

                        WILLOW
          There's nobody here.

They approach the twelve pillars.

                        RAZIEL
          The Knights of the Pacalcade.  The
          king's bravest warriors.

Suddenly they hear hoofbeats and a warcry.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Kael and his army charge out of the cave and trample
across the valley of flowers.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan rushes to the heavy door and strains to
shut it.

                        RAZIEL
          Turn them back, Willow!

Willow stares at the twelve knights.

                        WILLOW
          How??

                        RAZIEL
          Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur-
          ry!  Invocation!  Release them!

The castle door is rusted and old.  madmartigan heaves
against it.  Outside he can see the army storming to-
ward him.

Willow digs out his philosopher's stone.  He squints
and strains, concentrating his energy.

                        WILLOW
          Beings within, beings without!
          Danu danu walkail funfawtha!

He continues to chant and to concentrate.  One of the
knights comes to life.

                        WILLOW
          I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here!
          Look!  You gotta see this!  I did
          it!

                        RAZIEL
          More!  More!

Madmartigan heaves the door shut just as the army
charges up, and he locks it with a huge bolt.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen rear back form the locked door.

                         KAEL
          Assault!  Scale the walls!

He sends his men in all directions.  They leap off
their horses and hack down trees from the nearby woods.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow brings the knights to life, one by one.

                        WILLOW
          Tuatha tuatha danu!

Each knight shakes himself into action.  Madmartigan
follows them in an armory.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!  I transformed them all!
          I'm a magician!

                        RAZIEL
          You didn't transform them, Willow,
          you released them.  That was noth-
          ing.  Now change me.

Willow's on a roll.  He rubs his hands together.

                        WILLOW
          I feel like I could do anything!

He drops to his knees and stretches his philosopher's
stone apart like an accordian.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - ARMORY

Madmartigan and the knights grab weapons and armor.
Two knights wheel a catapult out ot the battlements.
Madmartigan wees, displayed specially on a rack, a com-
plete set of armor of shining silver.  He reaches out
to touch it.

                        KNIGHT
          It belonged to our king.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

The knights light a fire and boil vats of oil.  Willow
struggles to transform Raziel, trying to remember all
he has learned.

                        WILLOW
          Capture the enery...limitless
          power of the will...avvdachh doth
          indicht rredd baerkinhaekin!

Raziel begins to change.  From a bird, she expands,
stretches, and turns into a GOAT.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel?  Is that you?  Oh-oh.  What
          happened?

Raziel tilts her goat head.

                        RAZIEL
          I hate this.

Suddenly flaming arrows rain down over the castle wall.
Willow scoops up the baby and he and Raziel run for cover.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

From their horses Kael and Sorsha watch as the soldiers
climb the wall.  They suddenly hear a hacking noise
above and several Nockmaar men tumble down the ladders.
Sorsha looks up.

High on the wall stands Madmartigan, magnificently
dressed in the glimmering armor of the King!

Kael roars and points his deadly sword up at Madmarti-
gan.  Then several soldiers attack the castle door with
a huge battering ram and smash it open.

                         KAEL
          Attack!!

Kael and Sorsha gallop into the castle with otehr Nock-
maar horsemen, while Madmartigan continues to battle
attackers on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Willow looks up as the horsemen charge into the court-
yeard.  He makes a run for the hallway.  SIX HORSEMEN
chase after him, jumping off their horses and drawing
their swords.

Sorsha dismounts, draws a sword, and strides up the
stairs toward teh top of the wall.

INT. ARMORY

Willow runs into the armory and sets the baby down in a
corner.  The six horsement run in and corner him.  He
grabs an enormous broadsword.  Swings it like a base-
ball bat.  The momentum of the heavy sword hurls Willow
across the room.  The blade pierces a Nockmaar man.
Willow grunts and yanks the sword out.  The remaining
soldiers come after him.  Willow swings and flashes the
sword as they close in on him.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

In the courtyard, Raziel the goat butts a few soldiers
as the battle rages.

UP ON THE WALL

Madmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down
the wall.  Then he turns around.  Five more enemy
swordsmen slash at him.  Madmartigan is amazing:  spin-
nig, lunging, ducking, he takes out one, two, three,
four of them with ease.  But not the fifth.

It's the Nockmaar Lieutenant.  He and Madmartigan
swordfight.  The Lieutenant hacks the sword out of
Madmartigan's hand: it clatters down into the court-
yeard.

Madmartigan throws up his arm.  The Lieutenant's sword
clangs against his wrist armor, knocking Madmartigan
onto his back.  With two hands the Lieutenant lifts his
sword high and goes to kill Madmartigan.  madmartigan
shuts his eyes.  But nothing happens.

Madmartigan opens his eyes.  the Lieutenant stands
there, frozen, staring at him.  Then falls forward.
Rolls over Madmartigan.  And plummets off teh wall.  In
his place stands Sorsha, holding a bloodied sword.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          Madmartigan.

He props himself up on his elbows and smiles.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Whose side are you on?

She reaches down and pulls Madmartigan to his feet.

                        SORSHA
          Yours.

They look into each other's eyes.  They go to embrace.

                        MINION
          Arrrggghhh!

Out of nowhere a Nockmaar minion attacks them, his
sword flashing over his head. Sorhsa hardly moves.
She simply dusts him off the wall with her sword.  She
turns back to Madmartigan.

                        SORSHA
          I love you.

Their armor clanks as they throw their arms around each
other and kiss, high up on the castle wall.

INT. TIR ASLEEN - COURTYARD

Kael looks up from his horse.

                         KAEL
          Sorsha!!

He sees Sorsha and Madmartigan coming down the wall,
fighting Nockmaar troops.  Kael holds up his great
hand.  In it he holds the baby.

                         KAEL
          Bordak!

Kael waves his men after Sorsha and Madmartigan.

                         KAEL
          Kill them both!

He laughs viciously then gallops toward the castle
door.  As he reaches it he abruptly stops.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Two hundred HORSEMEN are charging straight toward Kael.
Led by Airk Thaughbaer!

CLOSER, riding in Airk's saddlebags, with their tiny
daggers flashing, are the long-lost brownies, Teemo and
Rool!

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael stuffs the baby deep inside his tunic.

                         KAEL
          Troops!  To Nockmaar!  Ride with
          me!

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Kael and his men gallop across the valley of flowers
and hack their way through Airk's army.

INT. TIR ASLEEN

Madmartigan and Sorsha mount horses.  Willow staggers
out of the armory, wounded and bleeding.

                        WILLOW
          I'm sorry.  There were too many of
          them.

Madmartigan scoops him up.  With seven surviving
knights, they ride out.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN

Many of Kael's men fall in battle.  But Kael and a
dozen horsemen plow through and escape into the cave.

Madmartigan rides up to Airk Thaughbaer and their
horses powerfully dance around each other.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Out for a little ride in the coun-
          try, Airk?

                         AIRK
          Thought you might get lonely, Mad-
          martigan!

Then they drop the bravado and clasp hands.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Thank you, friend.

                         AIRK
          Let's go.

They charge into the cave.  The clamor of their
hoofbeats echoes and then fades to silence.  The valley
is littered with fallen soldiers.

Then, Raziel trots out of the castle.  She clip-clops
across the valley and follows the others to the cave.

EXT. VOLCANIC MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

The Nockmaar horsemen race out of the cave and gallop
up the obsidian mountain toward the dark castle.

The army of Tir Asleen thunders out of the cave in pur-
suit.

Arrows fire back and forth.  The Tir Asleen army stays
right on the enemy's tail.  Willow hangs on to Madmar-
tigan for dear life.

Airk and Madmartigan ride side by side, perfect team-
work, and cut a few Nockmaar ment down.

Then Madmartigan turns and sees Sorsha ride up past
everybody.  What a rider she is!  She surprises a cou-
ple of Nockmaar soldiers, swordfighting as she rides,
killing them both.  But she can't catche Kael.  He rides
ahead of everyone else, whipping his horse at an in-
credible speed toward the castle.

The chase continues up the mountain.  The Tir Asleen
army keeps firing arrows at the enemy, or cutting them
down with their swords, until only two Nockmaar men
ride behind Kael.  At last Kael reaches the castle
drawbridge and leaps onto it as it begins to rise.  His
two remaining horsemen leap after him but fall short
and tumble into the dry craggy moat.

The drawbridge shuts with a loud echoing KLUNGG!  Mad-
martigan and Arik screech to a halt on the brink of the
moat.  They look up.  The castle loom, huge, dark,
powerful, evil.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Sorsha!  Any way in there?

Sorsha rides up to his side.

                        SORSHA
          No.  The fortress is protected on
          all sides.

The Tir Asleen warriors, dwarfed by the huge black
wall, look at one another with doubt and worry.

                         AIRK
          Make camp!  We'll assault at dawn.

The army dismounts and begins to unpack supplies.  It
is late in the day and shadows lengthen toward evening.

INT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - LATE AFTERNOON

Kael carries the baby through the castle and climbs up
the gloomy narrowing stairs of the QUEEN'S TOWER.  He
comes to a large door and hesitates a moment, showing
fear.  Then creaks the door open.

INT. QUEEN'T TOWER

BAVMORDA looks up.  Kael cowers, afraid of her evil
power.

                       BAVMORDA
          Kael!

Carved in the floor is a MAGICIAN's CIRCLE, and in the
very middle of this is a sacrificial altar made of
shining copper.  Bavmorda stands over the altar, wear-
ing black robes.  Behind her stand two decrepit DRUIDS.
Kael bows.

                         KAEL
          Queen Bavmorda.  I have the child.

The baby squirms and cries.  Seething with hate, Bav-
morda reaches out her arms, then shrinks back.

                       BAVMORDA
          We must start the ritual!

She hears noise outside the castle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who is that?

                         KAEL
          An army of rebels and traitors.

Bavmorda closes her eyes, holds out her hands and feels
the vibrations and energy around her.  Psychically:

                       BAVMORDA
          Where is Sorsha?

                         KAEL
          She has turned against you.

Bavmorda opens her eyes furiously.  to her druids:

                       BAVMORDA
          Purify the altar!  Arrange the im-
          plements!  I'll deal with Sorsha!

The druids take the baby from Kael.  Bavmorda storms
out the door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASLTE - DUSK

The Tir Asleen rebels pitch tents and build fires.
Then they feel a terrible presence and look up at the
castle wall.  Amid torches and hideous minions, Bavmor-
da leers down at them and laughs.

                       BAVMORDA
          This is not an army!

Sorsha looks up, and her mother seems to laugh right at
her.  Madmartigan steps forward.  Seeing him in the ar-
mor of the King, Bavmorda stops laughing, taken aback.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow!  Get out of here!  Quick!
          Hide!

Raziel suddenly butts Willow into a tent.

INT. TENT

Willlow tumbles into the tent and Raziel follows him.

                        RAZIEL
          Get down!  The ritual chant!
          Quick!  Protect yourself!

                        WILLOW
          Why?

                        RAZIEL
          Just do it!

Willow takes out his philosopher's stone and begins to
chant.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE

Madmartigan faces the queen.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We've come for Elora Danan!  Turn
          her over to us!

Bavmorda stabs her finger down at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You dare to challenge me?  You are
          not warriors.  You're pigs!

She waves her hand, casting a horrible spell over the
army.  Madmartigan's body begins to change its shape.
His armor breaks apart.  He grows hideous.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're all pigs!

The rebel soldiers panic and run.  Slowly, horribly,
they all expand and contort, ripping out of their armor
and clothers, casting down their weapons and shields.

                        SORSHA
          Mother!  No!!

                       BAVMORDA
          You made your decision!

Bavmorda points at Sorsha, and Sorsha, too, begins to
change.  The mountainside becomes a sea of writhing
flesh.  Every one of the Tir Asleen army is transformed
into a pig.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DUSK Bavmorda throws open the
door.  Her druids are binding the baby in a leather
thong.

                       BAVMORDA
          Begin the ritual.  Now!  Light the
          first candle.

A druid lights on of THIRTEEN ENORMOUS CANDLES.  Bav-
morda glares up at the roof.  In the middle of it is a
large circular hole showing the starlit sky.

                       BAVMORDA
          Come, thunder.  Come lightning.
          Touch this altar with your pwer.
          Come into my tower...

Lightning flashes faintly and thunder rumbles in the
distance.  Bavmorda smiles with satisfaction.

A druid places teh baby on the altar.  The other druid
hits a loud gong, once.  Bavmorda enters the Magician's
Circle.  Her face contorts as she recites:

                       BAVMORDA
          Dark runes, dark powers!  Blend and
          bind, bind and blend, Universal
          night!  And the might of Nockmaar!

Magically she produces a razor-sharp knife.  Lightning
flashes again, getting closer.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow is crouched on his knees, chanting with her eyes
closed.

                        RAZIEL
          It's over, Willow.  You did well.
          You protected yourself.

Willow looks up.  He hears the grunting outside.  With
great trepidation, he crawls to the tent door.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT

Willow shudders in horror at the grotesque sight.  Amid
horses and tents and weapons, hundreds of pigs wander
about.  Willow stands and walks through them.  He looks
down at one point and sees Rool and Teemo:  two tiny
baby pigs.  Then he turns and runs back into the tent.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow collapses to his knees beside Raziel.

                        WILLOW
          I've come all this way and now
          Elora Dana's going to die!

                        RAZIEL
          No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!

                        WILLOW
          She's too powerful, Raziel

Raziel sternly stamps the ground with her hoof.

                        RAZIEL
          A true magician, Willow, never
          surrenders.  She is a sorceress--I
          am a sorceress!  Transform me now
          and I will destroy her!  Hexagram!

Willow grabs a sword and draws a hexagram around Ra-
ziel.  He steps outside of it, holds up his
philosopher's stone and begins his magic.

                        WILLOW
          Banish all disturbing forces from 
          this place.  Fire, water, above and
          below.  Balance.  Balance.  Bal-
          ance.

Raziel begins to change.  Willow wrestles with his own
powers of concentration and will, now and then losing
strength.

                        RAZIEL
                   (voice distorted)
          Don't give up!  Willow!

He chants and strains.  Raziel momentarily changes into
a partly-formed grotesque creature.  Then into a deer.
Then she becomes human.  At last she becomes herself, a
once-beautiful and now elderly woman.  Willow covers
her unclothed body with a simple smock.

                        WILLOW
          Raziel!

She looks down at her old hands.  Then her eyes focus
with purpose.

                        RAZIEL
          We've got a lot of work to do, Wil-
          low.  Bring in our brave men.

Willow opens the tent.  Some pigs shuttle in, and Ra-
ziel begins to change them back into warriors.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE -NIGHT

Stationed high on the castle wall, three Nockmaar MIN-
IONS laugh and drink.  Then they hear the terrible
SCREAM of the baby.  They look up at the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

A druid hits the ceremonial gong, twice.  The baby
shrieks.  Standing over her, Bavmorda crushes a piece
of glass with her bare hands and drops the fragments
into a Witch's Bottle.

                       BAVMORDA
          Black fire forever kindled within,
          Let the second right begin!

With a pair of razor-sharp shears she clips the baby's
tiny fingernails and sprinkles them into the Witch's
Bottle.  The bottle glows and sparks, and teh heavens
asnwer with distant thunder.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

In the dark Tir Asleen camp some figures crouch low and
hurry from tent to tent.  CLOSER, the faces of rebel
warriors, watching the castle wall.  Fear.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Willow, Raziel, Madmartigan, Sorsha, Airk Thaughbaer
and a dozen rebel warriors argue back and forth.

                         AIRK
          Uphill with our rough weapons,
          we'll never make it!

                        SORSHA
          Elora Danan will die!

                        RAZIEL
          By dawn, upon thirteen tolls of the
          runic drum!

                        WARRIOR
          Bavmorda is too powerful.  We need
          more forces.  I say we retreat!

The other warriors agree.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda cannot transform you.
          I've protected this camp with a
          spell.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Can you use your magic to get our
          men into the fortress, Raziel?

Raziel shakes her head.

                        RAZIEL
          Bavmorda has shielded it with a
          spell of her own.

The warriors grumble and protest.  In a corner, Rool
and Teemo poke their heads in under the canvas.  Curi-
ously they look at Willow, who sits in silence and deep
though, scratching the ground with his fingernail.

The warriors rumble.

                        WILLOW
          Wait!!

Willow jumps to his feet.  They all turn to him.

                        WILLOW
          I have an idea.  Back in my village
          we catch a lot of hedgehogs.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Willow, this is war, not agricul-
          ture!

                        WILLOW
          I know, I know!  But this is a way
          to get into that castle...

The all gather around Willow to listen.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

Thunder rumbles.  Bavmorda looks up.  Her face is gra-
dually becoming more grotesque as the ritual proceeds.
A druid hits the gong three times.  Now three candles
are lit.  The baby screams on the altar.

With a demonic laugh, Bavmorda digs her hands into a
deep vat of blood then raises them over her head.  The
blood runs down her arms into the folds of her black
cloak.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

They all look at Willow.

                         AIRK
          It's too much work.

                        WARRIOR
          It can't be done.

                        SORSHA
          Kael will never fall for it.

Willow looks hopefully at Madmartigan.

                      MADMARTIGAN
                      (doubtful)
          I don't know, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Madmartigan, you promised me you'd
          take care of Elora Danan like your
          own daughter.  She is all that
          matters.  Are you going to abandon
          her?

Madmartigan turns away and scratches his beard.

                         AIRK
          Come on, Madmartigan.  you gonna
          listen to a Peck?  You and I are
          warriors.  You know this plan will
          never work.

Frustrated and torn, Madmartigan brushes Airk away.
The men rally with Airk.  Mdmartigan goes over to Sor-
sha.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We'll probably die here, Sorsha.

                        SORSHA
          I have no family.

The gong rings four time.  Raziel turns to Airk
and his men.

                        RAZIEL
          If we do not fight, and the baby
          dies, all hope for the future is
          lost.  I shall face the danger
          alone if I have to.

The men shake their heads.

                        WILLOW
          Me, too.

Madmartigan, still torn by indecision, raises his arm
and silences the protest.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Time is running out.  We must now
          decide who's going to leave and who
          is going to stay...

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - NIGHT

Light pulsates in the Queen's Tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - NIGHT

The druids cower behind Bavmorda, whose face has taken
on the hideous features of a hellish beast.  The baby
has been streaked with ritual paint.

                       BAVMORDA
          Ocht veth nockkthirth bordak!

Her voice growls a sickening chant, and light shoots
out of her claw-liek fingers, enveloping the baby.  The
baby levitates above the altar in a cocoon of light.

EXT. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAWN

The sun rises over the volcanic mountain.  The gong
strikes twelve times.  PAN ACROSS the slope outside the
castle.  The Tir Asleen army is gone.  Littered across
the ground are flattened tents, borken wagons an dis-
carded shields.  The wind howls, taking bits of debris
with it.

Alone on the deserted mounatinside stand Willow and Rz-
ziel.

                        RAZIEL
          Time is running out.

                        WILLOW
          Surrender!!

Nockmaar soldiers peer down and laugh.  Willow and Ra-
ziel trek closer to the castle wall.  Willow cups his
mouth.

                        WILLOW
          We are all-powerful magicians!
          Give us the baby or we will destroy
          you!!

The Nockmaar soldiers roar with laughter.

                         KAEL
          Kill them!

The great drawbridge falls across the moat.  Willow
clutches a spear and trembles nervously.

                        RAZIEL
          Patience, Willow.

                        WILLOW
          Courage, Willow.

Hoofbeats.  EIGHT HORSEMEN ride out of the castle with
swords high.  Willow lifts his spear with two hands.
Turns.  And smashes the spear on the ground, striking a
loud war drum!

Suddenly Madmartigan leaps out of the ground on horse-
back!

And the entire mountainside comes to life.  Tents and
shields fly away and out of pits and trenches the Tir
Asleen army charges with one loud warcry!

The eight Nockmaar horsemen are quickly cut down.  The
rebels storm across the drawbridge into the castle.
Airk Thaughbaer scoops Willow up on his horse, and Sor-
sha scoops Raziel up on hers.

INT. NOCKMAAR COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Madmartigan leads the assault, cutting down Nockmaar
minions as they run out to defend the fortress.  Sorsha
slides off her horse with Raziel.  Airk sets Willow
down.  Sorsha leads Willow and Raziel into a dark hall-
way.

Rebel warriors storm into the courtyard.  Madmartigan
circles behind Airk, their horses dancing handsomely.

                         AIRK
          Let's squah 'em!

In unison, their swords flash and they charge across
the courtyard chopping down the enemy.

ENT CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

Sorsha hurries Willow and Raziel down a dark hallway.
They come to a corner.

                        SORSHA
          No, Willow!!

She grabs him by the collar and yanks him back.  A huge
DEATH DOG leaps out wiht a gnashing ROAR and Sorsha
kills it with her sword.  Willow sags with relief and
the women grab his hands and haul him further down the
tunnel.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

They come to the gloomy stairs that corkscrew up into
the Queen's Tower.  Willow climbs nervously behind Ra-
ziel and Sorsha.  At the top in THE DOOR.  Light throbs
behind it.

Suddenly they hear a loud SHRIEK and the door shakes
and bangs.  Willow fals to his knees, frozen with
fear.

                        SORSHA
          I will face my mother alone.

Willow and Raziel stay back on the stairs.  Sorsha
climbs to the door.  Courageously, she opens it.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda's monstrous face FILLS THE SCREEN.

                       BAVMORDA
          Sorsha!!

Sorsha recoils in horror.  Bavmorda looks barely human:
she has transformed into a grotesque witch.  She waves
her gnarled hand and her druids attack Sorsha.  Sorsha
kills them.  The baby lies under a deathlike spell on
the copper altar.

                        SORSHA
          I won't let you kill her!

Bavmorda's voice is a demonic growl!

                       BAVMORDA
          You are a weakling.  Like you fa-
          ther!  Can you not see that I am
          about to become all-powerful!

Lightning explodes overhead.  Sorsha lunges for the
baby.  But Bavmorda stops her with a powerful energy
force.

                        SORSHA
          No!!

Pulsating light lifts Sorsha, levitates her across the
room, and drives her toward a wall of spikes.  Just as
she is about to be implaes, another force stops her.
Bavmorda can sense the source of it:

                       BAVMORDA
          Raziel...!!

The door flies open.  The twelve burning candles all
blow out.  There stands Raziel.  Sorsha falls to the
floor, unconscious.  Raziel raises her arms magnifi-
cently.  The sorceresses face each other.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Battle rages.  Madmartigan and Airk lead the assault,
and the Tir Asleen rebels push back the Nockmaar min-
ions.  Down low, where weapons adn bodies fall and
horses clop and stamp, the brownies scurry along in
terror, arms crossed over their heads, looking for
shelter.

Like mice, they dart up some stairs.  Then a huge boot
nearly crushes them.  The dive away and look up.
Towering high above them, Kael lets out a loud warcry.
And brandishes two weapons, a huge sword and a huge
axe.

Madmartigan and Airk turn and see Kael.  They look at
each other.  Like samurai warriors they stand ready.
Kael ralles his weapons and charges toward them.

INT. TOWER STAIRWAY - DAY

Willow creeps toward the door.  It suddenly throbs and
flashes.  He jumps back.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda and Raziel oppose each otehr, circling the al-
tar.  The air between them crackles and sparks with the
concentration of energy between them.

                        RAZIEL
          The baby will be queen.  It has
          been foretold, Bavmorda.

                       BAVMORDA
          My ritual will kill the prophecy!
          Now the child dies with it, its en-
          ergy exiled into oblivion!
                  (lightning flashes)
          You see?  I hold the power of the
          universe!

                        RAZIEL
          Not until your ritual is complete!

                       BAVMORDA
          And who will stop me?  The elements
          are slaves to my command!

She points at the sky.  As if oberying her, lightning
flashes and thunder cracks.

                        RAZIEL
          There is no one who can match your
          sorcery.  Except me!

Raziel waves her arms and light suddenly swirls around
the room.  Bavmorda counters, and chairs come to life,
turning into beasts.  Objects fly about.  The tower be-
comes a storm of chaos and witchcraft.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

Kael swings his axe and sword at Airk and Madmartigan.
He roars at his army, and six Nockmaar swordsmen hurry
over to fight with him.  Madmartigan and Airk split up.
Madmartigan battles the six swordsmen.  Airk battles
Kael, who backs Airk up stairs on the castle wall.

Madmartigan fights in the courtyard.  He hears a yell
and looks up.  Kael strikes Airk down.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!!

Airk falls down the stairs.  Madmartigan finishes off
the swordsmen, then runs to him, grabs his bleeding
body.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Airk!  Airk!

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Madmartigan...you're a brave
          warrior...a true friend...a good
          man...

                      MADMARTIGAN
          We're gonna win this war, Airk.

An incredible smile lights up Airk's face as he dies.
Madmartigan stands.  Picks up his sword.  And goes up
the stairs after Kael.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

The sorceress continue their battle.  They change
each other into various beasts.  They fight, physically
and magically.

In the midst of chaos, the door opens.  Willow pokes in
his head, reacting in fear.  Then sneaks around the
wall of the room and makes a dash for the baby.

                       BAVMORDA
          As above, so below!  Universe of
          evil, Raziel!  It conquers even
          you!

Bavmorda hurls a final spell at Raziel, crippling her,
throwing her into a corner.  Bavmorda laughs and goes
to the altar.  The baby is gone.

Willow races toward the door with the baby.  The door
suddenly slams shut.  Bavmorda's voice roars out:

                       BAVMORDA
          *Stop!  Bring back that child!!!*

Willow stops.  He turns around.  Bavmorda towers over
him, grotesque, monstrous, poised to destroy Willow
with her magic.

                       BAVMORDA
          Who are you?

                        WILLOW
          I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm a magician.

Bavmorda laughs.  Willopw slowly walks toward her.  he
digs into his pocket.  Takes out the last magic acorn.

                        WILLOW
          I'm a *great* magician.

Willow throws the acorn at Bavmorda.  Her hand shoots
out and catches it.  the acron begins to turn her to
stone, petrifying her hand, her wrist, her arm.  Willow
backs away, feeling successful.  But with intense con-
centration of her evil will, Bavmorda fights off the
acron's spell.  It reverses:  her arm, wrist and hand
turn back to flesh.  She crushes the acorn in her
fingers and lets the dust fall to the floor.

                       BAVMORDA
          Is that the extent of your power?

Willow stands there helplessly.  Thunder cracks and
lightning flashes through the open ceiling above the
altar.

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

The Tir Asleen rebels, outnumbering and overpowering
the Nockmaar army, fight toward ultimate victory.

Madmartigan battles Kael on the wall outside the
Queen's Tower.  Up and up they go.  A spectacular
swordfight.  Until finally, Madmartigan stabs Kael
through the heart.  kael screeches and falls through
the air into the moat.

Madmartigna hurries toward the top of the tower.

INT. QUEEN'S TOWER - DAY

Bavmorda looks up at the sky then down at Willow.

                       BAVMORDA
          Place it on the altar.

                        WILLOW
          No.  You can't have her.

                       BAVMORDA
          By ritual, by sorcery, I well draw
          the lightning and send this child
          into the destructive realm.

Willow straightens up, boldly, courageously.

                        WILLOW
          And with my magic I'll send her 
          into the...into the...

He gropes for a word.  Bavmorda laughs at him.

                       BAVMORDA
          You're no magician.

                        WILLOW
          Into the good.

Bavmorda instantly stops laughing.  her eyes flash.

                       BAVMORDA
          Even I don't have the power to do
          that.  You're a fraud.

Willow suddenly starts chanting, loudly and desperate-
ly.  Raziel opens her eyes and watches.  The chenting
confuses Bavmorda.  Then, Willow cleverly whips the
baby under his legs and behind his back and suddenly
she's gone!

                       BAVMORDA
          Impossible!  Bordak!  Bordak!

Bavmorda flies into a rage.  She lunges across the
copper altar.  Thunder and lightning!

                       BAVMORDA
          Aaaaahhhh!!!

A bright fork of lightning, conjured by her own evil,
shoots in through the ceiling and strikes her.  She
howls in pain.  Her body contorts then bursts into
flame and burns into a shriveling pillar of ash.

Madmartigan breaks open the door and stomrs in.  He
scoops up Sorsha, reviving her with a kiss.

And as if Bavmorda's death has ended evil and oppres-
sion, Raziel stands up with renewed strength.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow...Willow...how...how did you
          do that?

Willow bends down under a nearby chair and picks up the
sleeping baby.

                        WILLOW
          It was just the old disappearing
          pig trick.

Elora Danan's eyes open.  And sunlight floods into the
tower.

EXT. TIR ASLEEN - DAY

Flags fly hihg above the wondrous caslte.  The valley
is lush with flowers, and the kingdom is once abain
alive with happy activity.

At the door of the castle, Willow stnds beside a cute
little white pony.  The court of Tir Asleen has gath-
ered to see him off.  Madmartigan, in robes and armor
worthy of a king, stands proudly beside his queen, Sor-
sha, who holds the baby princess, Elora Danan.

A trumpet blares.  Raziel comes forward from inside the
castle, dressed in druid robes, carrying a sacred BOOK.

                        RAZIEL
          Willow Ufgood.  Take this Book of
          Sorcery.  You are on your way to
          becoming a great magician.

Willow accepts the book.  Everyone applauds.  Willow
smiles gratefully and humbly.  He glances down and no-
tices Rool and Teemo, who have been civilized to a de-
gree with page boy uniforms, fuzzy haircuts, and nifty
little swords.

Madmartigan and Sorsha come forward, with Elora Danan.

                        WILLOW
          Your dream has come true, madmarti-
          gan.

Madmartigan smiles with thanks.

                      MADMARTIGAN
          Goodbye, Peck.

Willow has one last look at the baby.  She smiles and
giggles at him.  He happily gives her a kiss.

                        WILLOW
          Farewell, Elora Danan.

Suddenly Willow flies up in the air.  Madmartigan lifts
him onto the pony's back.  Willow and Madmartigan shake
hands warmly.  And Willow rides across the valley of
flowers, everybody waving goodbye to him.

EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY

Musicians stike up a welcoming march.  Willow rides
thorugh his village on his little pony, proudly carry-
ing the sacred book.  The Nelwyn people swarm around
him, wild with excitement and celebration.  Meegosh
runs up, deliriously happy.

The High Aldwin comes forward, beaming with pride, and
honors Willow with a nod of approval.  Willow presents
him with the book.  Old Burglekutt peers out.  His
mouth drops open and he shrinks away from the crowd.

                         KIAYA
          Willow!!

Willow stands up in his stirrups.  He sees Kiaya fight-
ing her way through the crowd to reach him.

                        WILLOW
          Kiaya!!

He jumps off his pony and runs to her.  They collide,
kiss and embrace.  Then Ranon and Mims jump on their
father and hug him.  Family and friends smother their
homecoming hero with love!


                       *THE END*

          EXT. WATCHUNG RESERVATION - DAWN.
                         
          It's a bitter cold January morning. The woods are quiet.
          Desolate. In the far off distance a man is jogging. He banks
          around the end of a small pond and runs right at us. This is
          MIKE FLAHERTY, FORTY-TWO. He is running hard. Or at least as
          hard as he can.
                         
          Suddenly TWO JOGGERS blow past him.

          A HOME MADE STAIN GLASS ANGEL hangs on a window. It falls to

          ABBY FLAHERTY, SIX-YEARS OLD, stirs and gets out of her bed
          out. She picks up the Bird and inspects it. It's broken.
                         
                          ABBY
           Shit.

          JACKIE FLAHERTY, THIRTY-SEVEN is still sleeping. Abby walks
          into the room. Jackie opens her eyes.

          Jackie lifts Abby onto the bed.
                         
                          ABBY (CONT'D)

           He's running.
                         
                          ABBY
           From what?
                         
          Jackie smiles.

          Jackie prepares some food. She knocks a glass over into the
          sink and it breaks.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Shit.
                         
          She looks over at Abby who is immersed in her coloring. Then
          she sets the food down in front of Stella who is sitting in a
          high chair. Mike enters wearing a suit and tie.
                         
                          JACKIE (CONT'D)

          What brand is this? Daddy, look. It's your team.
                         
                          JACKIE (CONT'D)
           They're all the same.
                         
          Mike looks at the drawing. It looks nothing like a team.
                         
                          MIKE
           That's my team? That's great,

          Mike pays for his coffee and bagel and starts to leave. He
          nods to a group of FIVE OLD MEN who wave him over. He tries
          to keep moving but they continue to engage him. Finally he
          joins the table. The group shares a laugh.

          Mike's car pulls into a driveway of an OLD HOUSE that has
          been converted into TWO OFFICES.
                         
          A SIGN on the lawn reads: "MICHAEL S. FLAHERTY, COUNSELOR AT

          Mike parks his car as a WORKMAN walks up from the basement of
          the house and gets into his VAN and pulls away.
                         
          Mike gets out of his car and walks toward the back door
          carrying his briefcase. He stops at the basement steps.

          files.

           Well Leo, remember you got lost and
           the police had to help you a few
           times. That's why we brought Jolie
           into help you, right?
                         
                          LEO
           So now what happens?
                         
                          MIKE
           Well if that Judge deems you
           incapacitated then you will need a
           guardian. And if we can't find your
           daughter then the state...

                          MIKE
           OK but if we can't find her then
           the State will have to become your
           guardian.

           That's crazy. I don't need New

           Right. I'm sure there's not. Let's

           They could but they never will.
           It's too much work. They'll
           probably move him into Oak Knoll.
           Hand me one of their brochures?

                          MIKE
           No, she can't. His guardian still
           has to make every single decision.

                          MIKE
           Couple of months. The doctor says
           it's stress.
                         
                          TERRY

                          MIKE
           Yeah. Jogging. Why the hell you

           Good call. So we just need a new

           already. I just need more.

          Mike hangs up the phone and sits at his desk. After a moment,
          he slams his hand on the desk. And then something catches his
          eye. It's LEO POPLAR'S FILE. He opens the file and see's the
          PAMPHLET FOR OAK KNOLL. He flips through the file and lands
          on a particular page and a particular line item.

          Leo walks through the metal detector. Mike watches him and
          then walks through himself but something beeps. The guards
          stops Mike. Leo starts to wander away.

           Well I hope so. You have your hands

           His daughter should be taking care

           your chest into his side.
                         
          Vig does it but he's a bit off.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           Just slide back a bit, Vig. A bit
           more. Yeah. Right there. Then you
           give him your full weight. Go ahead
           Vig.
                         
          Vig does. Pill starts to buckle. Vig is big.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           Then you ride the crotch and break
           him down with a cross-face.
                         
          Vigman grabs Pill under the crotch, applies a stiff cross-
          face and then drives him hard to the mat. Another Wrestler,
          STEMLER chimes in. Stemler is wearing a STAR WARS t-shirt.
                         
                          STEMLER
           Oh man, how'd that feel, Pill?
           We'll just call you "pancake"!
                         
          Stemler's a bit off.
                         
                          PILL
           Shut up, Chewbaka.
                         
                          STEMLER
           Yeah, right. More like the "Secret
           Apprentice".

          He moves well. Fluidly. Carlos keeps trying to grab Kyle's
          ankle but Kyle easily defends against it. Mike checks his
          watch. Then blows his whistle.

          what's happened, Kyle has grabbed his ankle and tripped him
          down to the mat.
                         
          Carlos looks shocked. Kyle pops back up but stays focused on
          Carlos. Mike looks to Vigman who raises an eyebrow,
          impressed. One thing is certain, Kyle can wrestle.

           the right thing.
                         
                          MIKE
           I'm not just helping out the old
           man, Ter. It's not like it's
           charity work. I'm getting paid for
           it.
                         
                          TERRY
           No. Shit, everyone gets paid, but
           think about it, Mike. What are the
           chances that this kid ends up on
           your door step and he can wrestle
           like that? It's a sign, pal.
                         
          This lands with Mike. Terry sits down at his computer.
                         
                          TERRY (CONT'D)
           Check this out. There's a video
           link of him wrestling in some
           tournament.
                         
          Terry presses play. It's grainy and amateur but good enough.
          Mike looks on.
                         
                          TERRY (CONT'D)
           Look at that kid.
                         
          Mike gets sucked in.

           Why not? Whether he's here for two

           something to do all day. Unless you

           made out to you and not the firm.
                         
                          MIKE
           Right. I'll take that.
                         
          Mike gets up and takes the check.

           No. It's not a legal fee. It's a
           personal fee.

          Jimmy and Kyle lock arms but Kyle pushes him away. Jimmy
          locks again but Kyle pushes him away again. Jimmy comes in
          hard this time and Kyle uses his momentum to quickly throw
          him to the ground.
                         
          Jimmy tries to scramble to his knees but Kyle is all over
          him. He quickly locks Jimmy in a cradle and rocks him onto

          quiet...except for Terry.

          Mike, Terry, Kyle, Jackie and the kids are eating pizza.
                         
                          TERRY
           I don't know why we didn't quit.
           Just the smell of that room brought
           back the memories. I hated it, it
           was like a form of self-abuse.
                         
                          KYLE
           Were you guys that bad?

           Mike was average. I sucked. Sorry

                          MIKE
           I gotta stop by the office and deal

                          TERRY
           We both should have quit. Then we
           could have joined the ski club and
           gotten busy with Allison Shepard on
           the overnights.

          Terry is sitting in Mike's office. A bottle of scotch and two

                          KYLE

          Mike emerges from under the desk.

                          TERRY
           Well first of all I'm fun. No
           denying that. And secondly, unlike
           Vig, I actually used to wrestle.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah, but Ter, you sucked.

           That doesn't matter, your team
           sucks. Plus I even look more like a
           coach then Vig.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah, that's not really value

                          TERRY
           Look, Mike, I'm serious here. I
           need some distraction in my life
           right now. All I do is sit in my
           condo and think about Lori and that
           guy having sex in the jacuzzi I
           paid for. It's fucking unhealthy.
           I've been really kind of going
           crazy. Really.
                         
          Mike looks at his friend. He can tell he's serious.

          laundry room. She peeks around the corner and sees that Kyle
          is not there. She crosses to his phone and picks it up. It
          reads "Mom". She answers it.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Hello? Hello, this Jackie Flaherty.
           Kyle is staying with us. Hello?

           I'm gonna kill that lady.
                         
          She sets the phone down and turns. Kyle is standing on the
          stairs. His hair is wet and he's carrying his towel.

           None of them. He quit.

           My step son and yes. Don't get me
           started, I thought becoming a coach
           might be a nice way for us to bond.
           He said it wasn't fierce and he
           quit.

           Vig is leading by example. Winners
           never quit.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           That's right, even if it sucks.
           This team is just depressing
           sometimes.

          The Pioneers are getting beat. Carlos is wrestling and
          putting up a good fight but time is running out and he's down
          by three points. He tries a desperate takedown but it
          backfires and the other wrestler picks up another two points.
          The buzzer sounds. Match over.
                         
          The team gets up to greet Carlos. Kyle strips off his sweats
          and buckles up his head gear. He walks up to Mike for a pep
          talk.
                         
                          MIKE

           This kid is good. So just...you
           know...be ready out there.
                         
          Terry gives Vigman a look. "Be ready?"
                         
                          KYLE
           Can you give me a slap?

           What?
                         
                          KYLE
           Give me a slap. Across the face.
           Like your waking me up.
                         
                          MIKE
           Uh, OK.
                         
          Mike cuffs Kyle on the side of the head gear.
                         
                          KYLE
           Can you do it harder?
                         
          Mike slaps him hard. And Kyle sprints to the mat and takes
          his stance.
                         
          The Ref blows the whistle and the wrestlers circle each
          other. The OTHER WRESTLER is clearly on the offensive.
                         
                          TERRY
           Come on, Kyle. Take this punk out.

           me.
                         
          The Other Wrestler shoots a single and takes Kyle down. Two
          points.

                          MIKE
           It's his first match. Give him a
           break.
                         
          The Other Wrestler is relentless. Kyle keeps trying to get up
          and the kid keeps breaking him down. Kyle stands up and Other
          Wrestler slams him to the mat. Kyle is getting beat up.
                         
          The two Wrestlers go out of bounds and the Ref stops the
          action. Kyle gets up and Mike checks in with him.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)

          Kyle gets into the bottom position.
                         
                          VIGMAN
           Did he smile?

           Good. That's good, right?
                         
          The Ref blows the whistle and Kyle explodes to his feet,
          kicking a leg back between the Other Wrestler's legs. He
          lower's his body, reaches behind him and whips the Other
          Wrestler to the mat.

          to the mat and calls the pin. Match over. The Team jumps up
          and cheers.

           That's got nothing to do with luck.
                         
          Kyle shakes the other wrestler's hands and the Ref raises his
          hand in victory. Kyle crosses to the opposing coaches and
          shakes their hands. Then he runs to back to his bench. Mike
          greets him with a handshake.

           Yeah, pretty good.
                         
          Mike smiles and Kyle sits down. The next wrestler, Jimmy
          steps up to Mike.

           Hey, Stemler. Come here.
                         
          Stemler walks over.

           Secret Apprentice. You got this.
                         
          Stemler buys it.
                         
                          STEMLER
           Yeah. You're right.
                         
          Stemler returns to the line slightly more confident. The Ref
          blows the whistle and the match starts. Stemler is
          immediately taken down. Terry looks at his feet.

          It's late in third period. Stemler is losing 13-0. Stemler
          is flat on his belly and he's getting mauled. The Ref calls
          him for stalling. One point. 14-0. Thirty seconds to go.
                         
                          MIKE

           What?
                         
                          VIGMAN
           He's one point away from a tech
           fall and we'd lose on criteria.
                         
                          MIKE
           Shit. Really?

                          VIGMAN
           If he falls behind by fifteen
           points it's a technical fall. They
           get five team points. If that
           happens the score would be tied but
           we'd lose the match on criteria.

          Stemler looks over. His eyes are wild.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           You need to get up! He's trying to
           drown you! He wants you dead. But
           you are not going to die on the
           bottom! Do you hear me? Do you?!
                         
          Stemler manages a nod, albeit a terrified one.
                         
                          MIKE (CONT'D)
           Good! Now just do the move we
           worked on in practice.
                         
          Off Stemler's confused look.

          Stemler almost manages a smile and then he hits "the move".
          It's not pretty but somehow he manages to get up and out. The
          team goes nuts. One point for Stemler. 15-1.
                         
          The Other kid frantically tries to take him down but Stemler
          holds him off dancing wildly around the mat. The buzzer
          sounds. The team goes nuts.
                         
          The Ref raises the other wrestler's hand in victory but it's
          Stemler who celebrates as if he just won the states. He runs
          off the mat and into the arms of his teammates.

           You know Kyle's doing really well
           with wrestling here, Cindy. The
           regions are this weekend and if he
           wins there then he goes to the
           states.
                         
                          CINDY
           That's great.
                         
                          MIKE
           Yeah. It is and it could be really
           good for him. It might even mean a
           scholarship. Anyway, I was
           wondering if you could stay here
           for another three weeks until
           that's all over.

                          MIKE
           I just can't go back in front of
           Judge Lee, it won't look good,
           trust me.
                         
                          TERRY
           So maybe you'll get a different
           judge.
                         
                          MIKE
           She's the only Judge who handles
           these cases and if I look bad in
           front of her right now, I'm
           screwed. I'll have to close my
           fricking doors.
                         
                          TERRY
           Then dump it. Give her Poplar. It
           sucks but you've got your practice
           to worry about, right?

           What's complicated about it? She
           doesn't give a shit about Leo. They
           hate each other. You can't let her

          Kyle looks at Mike and nods but his eyes are wild. The Ref
          blows the whistle and Kyle and the Other Wrestler lock up.
          They dance a bit and finally the Other Wrestler tries to wrap
          Kyle up. Kyle back pedals and then literally throws the Other
          Wrestler off the mat. The Ref has seen enough. He quickly
          issues Kyle his second warning and disqualifies him from the
          match. It's over.
                         
          The Other Wrestler pops up and runs at Kyle. Kyle responds.
          The Coaches all intervene. It's a melee.

          Kyle is sitting on the bench, perfectly still. Mike walks in
          and sits down next to him.
                         
                          MIKE
           How you doing?

           Hey, it's alright.
                         
          Mike puts his arm on his shoulder and Kyle starts to cry.
          Mike squeezes him.

          Mike, Terry and Kyle walk out of the school. The entire
          family is waiting for them. Jackie gives Kyle a big hug. Abby
          takes his hand. They all get into their car. Mike is just
          about to get in but then he sees Cindy standing by her car
          watching. He shuts his door and crosses to her.

           Yeah, well your son had a pretty
           good chance to do something special
           in there. Maybe even change his
           life and that's gone now. I hope
           you're happy.

           guy.

           You have no idea what my father

           Alright, I'll tell you what. You
           want the commission? You can have
           it. And you don't even have to take
           Leo. I'll take care of him for free

                          KYLE
           Don't touch me!
                         
          Mike deflects Kyle and Kyle spills to the ground.
                         
                          TERRY
           Oh shit.
                         
          Kyle gets up and starts to circle Mike. Mike has no choice
          but reciprocate.
                         
                          MIKE
           Would you let me explain?!
                         
                          KYLE
           Explain what? How you lied to me?
           How you lied to Leo?
                         
          Kyle head pumps. Mike takes the bait and jumps back.
                          MIKE TERRY
          Kyle wait... Watch the head fake!

           Kyle I don't want to wrestle you.
                         
                          JACKIE TERRY
          Kyle, stop for a minute. Keep your hands out, Mike.
           Hands out.

           You're not helping.
                         
          Kyle head fakes again but this time he's in. Before Mike
          knows what hits him, he's on his back.
                          MIKE TERRY
          Ow! Oh shit.

           Mike, stop it!
                         
          Kyle is all over Mike. Mike's trying to fight back but it's
          useless and even kind of pathetic.

          Terry rushes in and tries to pull Kyle off but he's lost it.
          Finally, he wraps his arms around Kyle and pulls him off.
          Kyle spins free and fronts Terry. Terry immediately puts up
          his hands.

           Yeah, it is.

           So why'd you move him if he wanted

                          MIKE
           Because it would have been too much
           work to leave him here. I couldn't
           have done it.

          his bag.
                         
                          KYLE
           This is bullshit!
                         
          Mike looks at Jackie.
                         
                          MIKE
           Hey, Kyle, listen -
                         
                          KYLE
           I want to be alone.
                         
                          MIKE
           What?
                         
                          KYLE
           (Without looking at them)
           I JUST WANT TO BE DOWN HERE ALONE!
                         
                          MIKE
           OK. All right. Yeah.
                         
          Jackie and Mike turn and start to walk upstairs but Jackie
          stops.
                         
                          JACKIE
           Kyle, I just wanna say - we love
           you.
                         
          Kyle keeps his back turned to them as they continue up the
          stairs.

          talking to Abby.

          Mike is sitting alone at the kitchen table drinking a cup of
          coffee. The remnants of a pancake breakfast are on the table.
          There is one clean plate where Kyle usually sits.
                         
          After a moment, Kyle comes up from the basement and sits down
          at the table without saying anything.
                         
          He just looks at Mike. Then he serves himself a few pancakes.
          Mike passes him the bottle of syrup. He takes it and puts
          some on his pancakes.
                         
          He eats. Mike watches.

          Mike and Eleanor step to the side. She looks at Mike.

           You know the transcript alone is

          Eleanor just looks at him, Judge and Jury. Mike blinks.
                         
                          ELEANOR
           Shame on you counselor.

          together.

          Kyle look to Jackie who gives him the OK. He walks over as
          Mike steps away. He just looks at his mother. She gently
          touches his face. He doesn't move.
                         
          Everyone looks on as Cindy says a few words to Kyle, hugs him

Withnail and I

 
Withnail and I

Camden Town, London. 1969

The Flat.

[A few shafts of sunlight sneak through the curtains and illuminate a
sitting room. There are empty bottles everywhere. 'I', who is smoking a
joint, gets up somewhat precariously and walks into a kitchen which is full
of bottles and dirty washing up. He lights the gas on the stove and puts on
the kettle.]

['I' knocks on the door to Withnail's bedroom]

I:
     I'm having a cup of tea, do you want one?

[He waits for a response.]

I:
     Do you want a cup of tea Withnail!?
Withnail:
     No.

['I' leaves the flat, slamming the front door behind him]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cafe

['I' is reading a paper at a table in the cafe. The proprietor is cooking
eggs in a frying pan full of grease. She takes one out, inserts it between
two slices of bread and places it in front of an elderly woman who inspects
it doubtfully and bites into the sandwhich. Yolk runs out of the other
edge. 'I' turns his attention to his paper. The story is about a
transexual, the headline 'Love made up my mind, I had to become a woman'.
He looks around at the other customers.]

I [mentally]:
     Thirteen million Londoners have to cope with this, and bake beans and
     allbran and rape, and I'm sitting in this bloody shack and I can't
     cope with Withnail. I must be out of my mind. I must go home at once
     and discuss his problems in depth.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Flat

[I stumbles up the barely lit stairs looking unwell. Withnail emerges from
his room holding a bottle and glass and follows him.]

Withnail:
     I have some extremely distressing news.
I:
     I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear anything. Oh God, it's a
     nightmare out there I tell you.
Withnail [pouring some wine]:
     We've just run out of wine what are we going to do about it?
I:
     I don't know. I don't know. I don't feel good. Look! My thumbs have
     gone weird. I'm in the middle of a fucking overdose. My hearts beating
     like a fucked clock. I feel dreadful, I feel fucking dreadful.
Withnail:
     So do I. So does everyone. Look at my tongue. A grey yellow sock. Sit
     down for Christ's sake, what's the matter with you? Eat some sugar.

[I goes into the kitchen which is by now full of steam and turns off the
kettle. Withnail follows him around reading from a newspaper.]

Withnail:
     Listen to this. "Curse of the superman. I took drugs to win medals
     said top athlete Geoff Woade."
I:
     Where's the coffee?
Withnail [reading from the paper]:
     "In a world exclusive interview 33 year old shot putter Geoff Woade
     who weight 317 pounds, admitted taking massive doses of anabolic
     steroids, drugs banned in sport. It used to get him bad tempered and
     act down said his wife. He used to pick on me. But now he's stopped
     his much better in our sex life and in our general life."

[I pours water from the kettle into a bowl and goes back into the living
room. Withnail follows him.]

Withnail:
     My God, this huge, thatched head with its earlobes and cannonball is
     now considered sane. "Geoff Woade is feeling better and is now
     prepared to step back into society and start tossing his orb about."
     Look at him. Look at Geoff Woade. His head must weight fifty pounds on
     its own.

[Withnail stands infront of a mirror and brushes his long, greasy hair with
a comb. I sits on the settee and starts drinking the coffee from the bowl
using a spoon.]

Withnail:
     Imagine the size of his balls. Imagine getting into a fight with the
     fucker!
I:
     Please! I don't feel good.
Withnail:
     That's what you'd say but that wouldn't wash with Geoff. No! He'd like
     a bit of pleading. Add spice to it. In fact, he'd probably tell you
     what he was going to do before he did it. "I'm going to pull you head
     off". "Oh no, please, don't pull my head off". "I'm going to pull your
     head off because I don't like your head!"

[he notives I drinking from the bowl.]

Withnail:
     Have you got soup? Why didn't I get any soup?
I:
     Coffee
Withnail:
     Why don't you use a cup like any other human being?
I:
     Why don't you wash up occasionally like any other human being?
Withnail:
     How dare you!? How dare you!? How dare you call me inhumane!?
I:
     I didn't call you inhumane, you merely imagined it. Calm down.
Withnail:
     Right you fucker - I'm going to do the washing up!

[He strides towards the kitchen. I jumps over the arm of the settee and
stops him.]

I:
     No no you can't. It's impossible I swear it. I've looked into in.
     Listen to me listen to me. There are things in there, there's a
     tea-bag growing. You haven't slept in sixty hours you're in no state
     to tackle it. Wait till the morning we'll go in together.
Withnail:
     This is the morning. Stand aside!
I:
     You don't understand. I think there may be something alive.
Withnail:
     What do you mean? a rat?
I:
     It's possible, it's possible.
Withnail [brandishing his comb]:
     Then the fucker will rue the day!

[He rushes up the the sink.]

Withnail:
     Oh Christ Almighty. Synous nicotine based. Keep back, keep back. The
     entire sink's gone rotten. I don't know what's in here.

[He picks up the kettle from the stove then throws it suddenly into the
sink.]

I:
     I told you. you've been bitten!
Withnail:
     Burnt, burnt, the fucking kettle's on fire.
I:
     There's something floating up.
Withnail [with a fork in his hand]:
     Fork it!
I:
     No no no, I don't want to touch it.
Withnail:
     You must you must. The poop will boil through the glaze. We'll never
be able to use the dinner service again.

[He rumages about in a drawer.]

Withnail:
     Here, get it with the pliers!
I:
     No, no, no, no, no, no. Give me the gloves.
Withnail:
     That's right, put on the gloves. Don't attempt anything without the
     gloves.

[I starts to move things about in the sink rather gingerly.]

Withnail:
     What is it? What have you found?
I:
     Matter.
Withnail:
     Matter? Where's it coming from?
I:
     Don't look. Don't look. I'm dealing with it!
Withnail:
     I think we've been in here too long. I feel unusual. I think we should
go outside.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Park

[Withnail and I walk along a path in the park.]

Withnail:
     This is ridiculous, look at me. I'm thirty in a month and I've got a
     sole flapping off my shoe.
I:
     It'll get better, it has to.
Withnail:
     Easy for you to say lovey. You've had an audition. Why can't I have an
     audition. It's ridiculous: I've been to drama school. I'm good
     looking. I tell you, I've a fuck sight more talent that half the
     rubbish that gets of TV. Why can't I get on TV?
I:
     Well I don't know. It'll happen.
Withnail:
     Will it? That's what you say. The only programme I'm likely to get on
     is the fucking news. I tell you, I can't take much more of this. I'm
     going to crack.
I:
     I'm in the same boat.
Withnail:
     Yeah, yeah. I feel as sick as a pike. I'm going to have to sit down.

[ They sit at a bench in the park.]

I:
     You know what we should do? I say, you know what we should do?
Withnail:
     How should I possibly know what we should do? What should we do?
I:
     Get out of it for a while. Get into the countryside. Rejuvenate.
Withnail:
     Rejuvenate! I'm in a park and I'm practically dead. What good's the
     countryside? What time is it?
I:
     It's eight.
Withnail:
     Fours hours to opening time. God help us. Have we got any embrocation?
I:
     What for?
Withnail:
     To rub on ourselves you fool. We'll cover ourselves in deep heat and
     get up against a radiator. Keep ourselves alive until twelve.

[He spits.]

Withnail:
     Jesus, look at that. Apart from a raw potato that's the only solid to
     have passed my lips in the last sixty hours. I must be ill.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Flat

[I is writting in a notebook on the settee while Withnail wonders round
wearing his overcoat and his underpants, smearing himself with deep heat.]

I [mentally]:
     Even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day. And for once
I'm inclined to believe Withnail is right; we are indeed drifting into the
arena of the unwell. Making an enemy of our own future. What we need is
harmony. Fresh air. Stuff like that.
Withnail:
     Wasn't much in the tube. there's nothing left for you.
I:
     Why don't you ask your father for some money. If we had some money we
could go away.
Withnail [inspecting a bottle for dregs]:
     Why don't you ask your father. How can it be so cold in here. It's
like Greenland in here. We've got to get some booze. It's the only solution
to this intense cold. Something's got to be done. We can't go on like this.
I'm a trained actor reduced to the status of a bum. I mean look at us!
Nothing that reasonable members of society demand as their rights! No
fridges, no televisions, no phones. Much more of this and I'm going to
apply for meals on wheels.
I:
     What happened to your cigar commercial?
Withnail:
     That's what I want to know. what happened to my cigar commercial. What
happened to my agent? Bastard must have died.
I:
     September. Bad patch.
Withnail:
     Rubbish. Haven't seen Gylgod down the labour exchange. Why doesn't he
retire.

[He picks up a paper.]

Withnail:
     Look at this little bastard. Boy lands plumb role for top Italian
     director. Of course his does. Probably on a tenner a day and i know
     what for: Two pound ten a tit and a fiver for his arse.

[He points accusingly at I.]

Withnail: Have you been at the controls!?
I:
     What are you talking about?
Withnail:
     The thermostats. what have you done to them?
I:
     I haven't touched them.
Withnail:
     Then why has my head gone numb. I must have some booze. I demand to
     have some booze.

[He lunges towards the mantlepiece where there is a bottle of lighter
fluid.]

I [standing up]:
     I wouldn't drink that if I were you.
Withnail:
     Why not?
I:
     Because I don't advise it. Even the wankers on the site wouldn't drink
     that. That's worse than meths.
Withnail:
     Nonsense, this is a far superior drink to meths. The wankers don't
     drink it because they can't afford it.

[He pours the contents of the bottle into his upturned mouth.]

Withnail:
     Ah. Ah. Have you got anymore?

[I shakes his head. Withnail presses forwards and I backs off.]

Withnail:
     Liar, what's in your toolbox?
I:
     No we have nothing. Sit down!
Withnail:
     Liar, you've got antifreeze.
I:
     You bloody fool. You should never mix your drinks! [Withnail laughs
     histerically, collapses to the floor and emits unpleasant vomitting
     noises.]
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Street

     [They walk towards a rather rough looking pub: 'The Old Mother
     Blackcap'.]

     Withnail:
          All right, this is the plan. We get in there and get wrecked.
          Then we'll eat a pork pie. Then we drop a couple of soamser
          fifties each; means we'll miss out Monday but come up smilling
          Tuesday morning. What's that appalling smell?
     I:
          Perfume on my boots. I had to scrub the with essence of petunia.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Pub

     [Withnail moves somewhat precariously to the bar. The pub is a simple
     affair with a few men sat round at tables drinking.]

     Withnail:
          Two large gins, two pints of cider. Ice in the cider.
     I:
          If my father was loaded I'd ask him for some money.
     Withnail:
          If your father was my father you wouldn't get it.
     Barman:
          : There you are lads.
     Withnail:
          Chin chin.
     [Withnail chinks his glass against the other, which I has not picked
     up yet, and downs the gin in one. I follows suit but gags slightly.]

     I:
          Ugh. What about what-his-name?
     Withnail:
          What about him?
     I:
          Why don't you give him a call.
     Withnail:
          What for?
     I:
          Ask him about his house.
     Withnail:
          You want me to call what-his-name and ask him about his house?
     I:
          Why not?
     Withnail:
          Alright. what's his number?
     I:
          I've no idea - I've never met him.
     Withnail:
          Well neither have I. What the fuck are you talking about?
     I:
          Your relative with a house in the country.
     Withnail:
          Monty? Uncle Monty?
     I:
          That's him. That's the one. Get the Jag fixed up. Spend the
          weekend in the country.
     Withnail:
          Alright. Give us a tenner and I'll give him a bell.
     I:
          Get a couple more in. I'm going for a slash.
     [Next to the door to the gents is a rather large Irish man sat with
     his pint and his paper.]

     Big Irish man:
          Ponce
     [I ignores him and goes into the gents.]

     I [to himself]:
          I could hardly piss straight with fear. he was a man with 3/4 of
          an inch of brain who'd taken a dislike to me. What had I done to
          offend him? I don't consciously offend big men like this. And
          this one's a decided imbalance of hormone in him. Get any more
          masculine than that and you'd have to live up a tree. [he reads
          the grafitti] 'I fuck arses', Who fucks arses? [aloud] Maybe he
          fucks arses. [to himself again] Maybe he's written this in some
          moment of drunken sincerity. I'm in considerable danger in here.
          I must get out of here at once.
     [He walks back into the bar.]

     Big Irish man:
          Perfumed ponce!
     [Withnail is still at the bar. He has made considerable progress with
     his cider and is eating some snack.]

     Withnail:
          You'll be pleased to hear Monte's invited us for drinks.
     I:
          Balls to Monty we're getting out.
     Withnail:
          Balls to Monty!? I've just spent an hour flattering the bugger.
     I:
          There's a man over there doesn't like the perfume. The big one.
          Don't look, don't look. We're in danger, we've got to get out.
     Withnail:
          What are you talking about?
     I:
          I've been called a ponce.
     [Withnail turns to address the room in general.]

Withnail:
     What fucker said that!?

[The large Irish gentleman in the corner gets up and walks over to them.
Now he is upright we see he is very large indeed and does not look
friendly.]

Big Irish man:
     I called him a ponce. And now I'm calling you one. Ponce!
Withnail (smiling):
     Would you like a drink?
Big Irish man:
     What's your name McFuck!?

[As he says this he jerks the scarf from around Withnail's neck.]

Withnail:
     I've a heart condition. I've a heart condition. If you hit me it's
     murder!
Big Irish man:
     I'll murder the pair of y'ers.
Withnail:
     My wife's having a baby. Listen, I don't know what my f.. [he starts
     to say friend but decides on a better course of action] acquaintance
     did to upset you but it's nothing to do with me. I suggest you both go
     outside and discuss it sensibly, in the street.

[They push past the man and rush to the door.]

Withnail:
     Ahhhh, out of my way.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bathroom

[I is in the bath shaving.]

I:
     Speed is like a dozen transatlantic flights without ever getting off
     the plane. Timechange. You lose, you gain. Makes no difference so long
     as you keep taking the pills. But sooner or later you've got to get
     out because it's crashing then all at once the frozen hours melt out
     through the nervous system and seep out the pores.

[Withnail enters with their lunch from the chippy]

Withnail:
     The bastards. Justice suck. It's a miserable cheap cigar and the
     bastards won't see me.
I:
     Why are we having lunch in here?
Withnail:
     It's dinner and Danny's here.
I:
     Danny!? How did he get in?
Withnail:
     I let him in this morning. He lost one of his clogs. He's come in
     because of the perpetual cold. I hope the buggers sales plummet.
I:
     I've got your savaloy. Here. I don't want it.
Withnail:
     Then stick it in the soap tray and save it for later.

[He scrunches up the paper that was holding his chips and puts it in the
toilet]

I:
     Don't vent spleen on me. I'm in the same boat.
Withnail:
     Stop saying that. You're not in the same boat. The only thing you're
     in that I've been in is this fucking bath.
I:
     Danny's here. Head hunter to his friends. Head hunter to everybody. He
     doesn't have any friends. The only people he converses with are his
     clients and occasionally the police. The purveyor of rare herbs and
     prescribed chemicals is back. Will we never be set free?
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Flat

     [I comes out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel.]

     I:
          Danny.
     Danny:
          You're looking very beautiful man. Have you been away? St. Peter
          preached the epistles to the apostles looking like that. Have you
          got any food.
     I:
          Mmm, As a matter of fact, got a savaloy.
     Danny:
          How much is it?
     I:
          You can have it for nothing.
     [Danny sniffs the sausage. Withnail enters from the kitchen gluing the
     sole back on his shoe. He is wearing a rather expensive looking suit.]

Danny:
     I see you're wearing a suit.
Withnail:
     What's it got to do with you?
Danny:
     No need to get uptight man. I was merely making an observation. I
     happened to be looking for a suit for the coal man two weeks ago. For
     reasons I can't really discuss with you the coal man had to go to
     Jamaica. Got busted coming back through Heathrow, had the weight under
     his fez. We wored out that it would be handycarma for him to get hold
     of a suit but he's a very low temperature spade the coal man, went
     into court wearing a kaftan and a bell. This doesn't go down at all
     well. They can handle the kaftan but they can't handle the bell. So
     there's this judge sitting there sitting in a cape like fucking batman
     with this really rather far out looking hat
Withnail:
     A wig.
Danny:
     No man, this was more like a long white hat. So he looks at the
     coalman and says 'what's all this. This is a court man. This ain't
     fancy dress' and the coal man looks at him and says 'you think you
     look normal, your honour?'. Cunt give him two years.

[I laughs a little. Withnail looks on unamuzed.]

Danny:
     I'm afraid I can't offer you gentlemen anything.
I:
     That's alright Danny. We'd decided to lay off for a bit.
Danny:
     That's what I thought. Except for personal use I concur with you. as a
     matter of fact i was thinking of retiring and going into business
Withnail [Scoffing]:
     Doing what?
Danny:
     The toy industry.

[There is a stange looking contraption on the table involving a bottle.]

Withnail:
     Thought you were in the bottle industry.
Danny:
     No man, that's a side line. You can have that. Instructions are
     included. Yeah. My partner's got a really good idea for making dolls.
     His name's 'Presuming Ed'. His sister give him the idea. She got a
     doll on Christmas what pisses itself.
Withnail:
     Really.
Danny:
     Then you've got to change its draws for it. Horrible really but
     they're like that the little girls. So we're going to make one that
     shits itself too.
Withnail:
     Shits itself!?
Danny:
     He's an expert. He's building the prototype now. [To I] Why's he
     behaving so uptightly.
Withnail:
     Because a gang of cheroot vendors consider a hair cut beyond the limit
     of my abilities
Danny:
     I don't advise a hair cut man. All hairdressers are in the employment
     of the government. Hair are your aerials. They pick up signals from
     the cosmos and transmit them directly into the brain. This is the
     reason bold-headed men are uptight.
Withnail:
     What absolute twaddle.
Danny:
     Has he just been busted?
I:
     No.
Danny:
     Then why's he wearing that old suit?
Withnail:
     Old suit? This suit was cut by Hawke's of Saville row. Just because
     the best tailoring you've ever seen is above you fucking appendix
     doesn't mean anything.
Danny:
     Don't get uptight with me man. Because if you do I'll have to give you
     a dose of medicine and if I spike you you'll know you've been spoken
     to.
Withnail:
     You wouldn't spike me you're too mean. Besides, there's nothing
     invented I couldn't take.
Danny:
     If I medicined you you'd think a brain tumour was a birthday present.
Withnail:
     I could take double anything you could.
Danny [removing his sunglasses]:
     Very, very foolish words man.
I:
     He's right Withnail. Look at him . His mechanisms gone. He's had more
     drugs than you've had hot dinners.
Withnail:
     I'm not having this shag-sack insulting me. Let him get his drugs out.

[Danny gets a doll out of a bag.]

Danny:
     This doll is extremely dangerous. It has voodoo qualities.

[Withnail snorts. Danny takes the head off the doll and extracts a handful
of pills.]

Danny:
     Trade: Phenodihydrochloride benzelex. Street: The embalmer.
Withnail:
     Balls. I'll swallow it and run a mile.
Danny:
     Cool your boots man. This pill's valued at two quid.
Withnail:
     Two quid! You're out of your mind.
I:
     That's sense Withnail.
Withnail:
     You can stuff it up your arse for nothing and fuck off while you're
     doing it.
Danny:
     No need to insult me man. I was leaving anyway. Have either of you got
     shoes?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monte's house

[A battered Jag pulls up outside Monte's house and Withnail and I get out.
There is a rather flash looking open-topped Rolls parked outside. The sound
of a Schubert piano sonata comes from the house.]

Withnail:
     Monte's car.

[Withnail knocks on the door. Monte, a rather fat, effeminate, middle-aged
gentleman, opens the door. He is holding a very large fluffy cat and a
watering can.]

Monty:
     Oh hello. Come in.

[They enter and go into the lounge.]

Monty:
     Sit down do. Would you like a drink?

[They sit together on a sette.]

Withnail:
     Sherry!
Monty:
     [To withnail] Sherry. [To I] Sherry?
I:
     Sherry.
Monty:
     Sherry.

[Monty moves to the sideboard and pours the drinks. Withnail lights up yet
another cigarette.]

Monty:
     Do you like vegetables? I've always been fond of root crops but I only
started to grow last summer. I happen to think the cauliflower more
beautiful than the rose.
Withnail:
     Chin chin.

[He drinks the sherry.]

Monty:
     Do you grow?
Withnail:
     Geraniums.
Monty:
     Oh you little traitors. I think the carrot infinitely more fascinating
     than the geranium. The carrot has mystery. Flowers are essentially
     tarts. Prostitutes for the bees. There is you'll agree a certain je ne
     ses quoi oh so very special about a firm young carrot. Excuse me. Do
     help yourselves to another drink.

[Withnail turns and reaches a bottle over from the sideboard. He takes a
long swig. ]

I:
     What's all this. The man's mad.
Withnail:
     Eccentric.
I:
     Eccentric? He's insane. Not only that he's a raving homosexual.

[There is a yowl from the cat. Monte storms back into the room preceded by
the cat.]

Monty:
     You beastly little parasite. How dare you? You little thug. How dare
     you? Ooohhhh. Beastly ungrateful little swine.

[He deposits his considerable bulk on the other settee, facing the first.]

Withnail:
     Shall I get you a drink Monte?
Monty:
     Yes. Yes please dear boy. You can prepare me a small rhesus negative
     Bloody Mary. And you must tell me all the news. I haven't seen you
     since you finished your last film.

[I smiles wriley to himself. Withnail downs the drink he has prepared for
himself, pours another and starts making the Bloody Mary for Monty.]

Withnail:
     Rather busy uncle. TV and stuff. My agent's trying to edge me towards
     the Royal Shakespeare again.
Monty:
     Oh splendid.
Withnail:
     He's just had an audition for rep.
Monty:
     Oh splendid. So you're a thespian too?

[Withnail delivers Monte's drink and sits beside him.]

Withnail:
     Monte used to act.
Monty:
     I'd hardly say that. It's true I crept the boards in my youth but I
     never had it in my blood and that's what so essential isn't it?
     Theatrical zeal in the veins. Alas, I have little more that vintage
     wine and memories.

[He stands and looks at a photograph on the mantlepiece.]

Monty:
     It is the most shattering experience of a young man's life when he
     awakes and quite reasonable says to himself: [He puts his hand on his
     heart] I will never play The Dane. When that moment comes, ones
     ambition ceases. Don't you agree?
Withnail:
     A part I intend to play, Uncle.
Monty:
     And you'll be marvelous. [He starts quoting from Hamlet] We do it
     wrong, being so majestical. To offer it the show of violence......

[As Monte rambles in the background I steps over to Withnail and whispers.]

I:
     He's a madman. Any moment now he's going to rush out and get into his
     tights.
Withnail:
     Ok ok. Give me a minute.
I:
     The house or out.

[Withnail stands and moves over to Monte.]

Withnail:
     Could I have a word with you Monte?
Monty:
     Oh forgive me dear boy, forgive me. I was allowing memories to have
     the better of me.
Withnail:
     Shall I get you a top up? [He moves to the sideboard again. Monte sits
     down and reminisces.]
Monty:
     Indeed I remember my first agent. Raymond Duck. Dreadful little
     Israelite. Four floors up at the charring cross and never a job at the
     top of them. I'm told you're a writer too. Do you write poems?
I:
     No, I wish I could. It's just thoughts really.
Monty:
     Have you published?
I:
     No no.
Monty:
     Where did you school?
Withnail:
     He went to the other place Monte.
Monty:
     Oh you went to Eton?
     [The cat reappears on I's chair.]

Monty:
     Get that damned little swine out of here. It's trying to get itself in
     with you. It's trying for even more advantage. It's obsessed with its
     gut - its like a rugby ball now. It will die, it will die!
     [He storms around ineffectually.]

Withnail:
     Monte, Monte.
Monty:
     No dear boy you must leave, you must leave. Once again that oaf has
     destroyed my day.
Withnail:
     Listen Monte. Can I just have a quick word in private.
Monty:
     Oh, very well.

[Later they are leaving the house. Monty shows them to the door.]

Monty:
     Good night my dears.
Withnail:
     Good night Monty.

[Monty closes the inner door to the porch behind them.]

I:
     What's all this going off in private business? Why did you tell him I
     went to Eton?
Withnail:
     Because it wouldn't have helped if I hadn't.
I:
     What do you mean by that?
Withnail [Showing him the key to the cottage.]:
     Free to those that can afford it. Very expensive to those that can't.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The car

     [They leave Camden in I's battered old Jag. Withnail, still in his
     suit, has a bottle and is clearly drunk. They pass some schoolgirls.]

     Withnail:
          Scrubbers!
     Scrubber:
          Up yours grandad!
     Withnail:
          Scrubbers! scrubbers!
     I:
          Shut up.
     Withnail:
          Little tarts they love it.
     I:
          Listen, I'm trying to drive this thing as quietly as possible. If
          you don't shut up we'll get stopped by the police.
     [The pass a notice anouncing an accident blackspot.]

     Withnail:
          Look at that, look at that. Accident black spot. These aren't
          accidents. They're throwing themselves into the road gladly.
          Throwing themselves into the road to escape all this hideousness.
          [To a pedestrian] Throw yourselves into the road darling, you
          haven't got a chance.
     [Somewhat later they join the motorway.]

     Withnail:
          At some point or another I want to stop and get hold of a child.
     I:
          What do you want a child for?
     Withnail:
          To tutor it in the ways of righteousness and procure some
          uncontaminated urine.
     [He takes out the bottle and instructions provided by Danny.]

     Withnail:
          This is a device enabling the drunken driver to operate in
          absolute safety. You fill this with piss, take this pipe down the
          trouser and sellotape this valve to the end of the old chap. Then
          you get horrible drunk and they can't fucking touch you.
          According to these instructions, you refuse everything except a
          urine sample. You undo your valve, give them a dose of
          unadulterated child's piss and they have to give you your keys
          back. Danny's a genius. I'm going to have a doze.
          [They drive on. Later, with the light fading, they leave the
          motorway. It becomes clear that the car has only one functioning
          headlight. Still later it is totally dark and raining heavily. I
          stops and attempts to transfer the single wiper from Withnail's
          side of the car to his own but it refuses to come off. He gets
          back in the car and in shutting the door wakes Withnail, who
          looks considerably the worse for wear.]

     Withnail:
          Are we there?
     I:
          No, we're not we're here and we're in the middle of a fucking
          gale. Now you'll have to keep a look out your side. If you see
          anything tell me. Get hold of that map.
     Withnail:
          Where's the whisky?
     I:
          What for?
     Withnail:
          I've got a bastard behind the eyes. I can't take aspirins without
          a drink. Where's the aspirin?
     I:
          Probably in the bathroom.
     Withnail:
          You mean we've come out here in the middle of fucking nowhere
          without aspirins?
     I:
          Where are we?
     Withnail:
          How should i know where we are. I feel like a pig shat in my
          head.
     I:
          Now get hold of that map and look for a place called Crow Crag.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The cottage

     [They draw up in a yard and get out of the car. Withnail staggers
     around aimlessly as I gets the baggage from the boot.]

     Withnail:
          There must and shall be aspirins.
     I:
          Give me the key and get out of the way.
     Withnail:
          If I don't get aspirin I shall die here on this fucking
          mountainside.
     [They enter the house. I lights a match and finds a lantern which he
     lights. As the light comes up the inside of the cottage becomes
     visible. It is rather spartan.]

     Withnail:
          Christ almighty
     [I looks round a little more thouroughly. He notices a picture of
     Monty on the wall.]

     I:
          Monty!
     [He looks accross to Withnail who is sat dejectedly in a chair.]

     I:
          What are you doing?
     Withnail:
          Sitting down to enjoy my holiday
     I:
          Right, now we're going to have to approach this scientifically.
          First thing we've got to do is get this fire alight, then we
          split into two fact finding groups. I'll deal with the water and
          the plumbings, you check the fuel and wood situation.
     [A little later Withnail re-enters the cottage from a rather wet and
     windy night. He is holding a small stick.]

     I:
          What's that?
     Withnail:
          The fuel and wood situation. There's nothing out there except a
          hurricane. This place is uninhabitable.
     [They sit close to the fire, which is rather small.]

     I:
          Give it a chance. It's got to warm up
     Withnail:
          Warm up!? We may as well sit round a cigarette. This is
          ridiculous. We'll be found dead in here next spring.
     [He attemps half-heartedly to light a cigarette.]

     Withnail:
          I've got a blinding fucking headache. Got to have heat!
     [He stands and smashes a chair against the floor. A little later the
     fire is burning considerably higher.]

     Withnail:
          Problem's we've got to keep this bastard burning
     I:
          Well we've got enough furniture for tonight. Tomorrow we get down
          that farm and get some logs.
     Withnail:
          This is a mistake I tell you. This is a dreadful mistake.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     I's bedroom

     [I wakes the next morning and gets out of bed. He checks on Withnail
     who is still asleep. He steps outside and walks accross the yard to
     examine the view. It is quite magnificent. Later, he is dressed and
     walks down to the farm. The building is surrounded by an assortment of
     farmyard junk. He knocks at the door]

     Old woman:
          Who's there?
     I:
          Me!
     [The door opens cautiously and an old woman peers out inquiringly.]

     Old woman:
          What do you want?
     I:
          I'm a friend of Montague Withnail. He's lent us his cottage. I
          wondered if you could sell us some food. Eggs and things.
     [She looks blankly at him.]

     I:
          What about wood and coal?
     [Again, he elicits no responce. Seeing she is wearing a hearing aid,
     he bends down and talks directly to it.]

     I:
          I'm not from London you know!
     Old woman:
          I don't care where you come from.
     [She slams the door. I walks away.]

     I:
          [to himself] Not the attitude I'd been given to expect from the H
          E Bates novel I'd read. I thought they'd all be out the back
          drinking cider, discussing butter. Clearly a myth. Evidently
          country people and no more receptive to strangers than city
          dwellers.
     [He walks back to the house and addresses the door.]

     I:
          Do you think you could tell me where I could buy some coal and
          wood?
     Old woman:
          You'll have to see my son. He runs this farm.
     I:
          Where is you son?
     Old woman:
          Up in top field. You can't miss him, his legs bound in polythyne.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The cottage

     [I walks back into the yard outside the cottage, slips, and falls in
     the mud. He picks himself up and storms inside.]

     I:
          Withnail you bastard wake up.
     [He bangs on the ceiling and moves to the sink to wash.]

     I:
          Oye, wake up you bastard you've got to get wood.
     [Withnail enters, dressed already and wrapped in a blanket.]

     Withnail:
          Jesus, you're covered in shit.
     I:
          I tried to get fuel and wood, there's a miserable little
          pensioner down there wouldn't give it me.
     Withnail:
          Where are we going to get it then?
     I:
          There's a man up on the mountain. Why he's up there, fuck knows,
          but he's up there with a leg bound in polythene, you can't miss
          him, he's your man. And have another look in that shed. Find
          anything. If you can't find anything, bring in the shed.
     [Later, they are sat down to a simple lunch.]

     I:
          How come Monty owns such a horrible little shack?
     Withnail:
          No idea.
     I:
          You never discuss your family do you?
     Withnail:
          I fail to see my family's of any interest to you. I've absolutely
          no interest in yours. I dislike relatives in general and in
          particular mine.
     I:
          Why?
     Withnail:
          I've told you why. We're incompatible. They don't like me being
          on stage.
     [He stands up and takes a foil from its bracket on the wall and
     strides up and down in actorly fashion.]

     I:
          Then they must be delighted with your career.
     Withnail:
          What do you mean?
     I:
          You rarely are.
     [Withnail points the sword menacingly, although there is a cork on the
     end.]

     Withnail:
          You just wait. Just you wait. When I strike they won't know what
          hit them.
     [He hears a noise from outside.]

     Withnail:
          Tractor approaching.
     [He goes to the window and knocks his head on the lantern hanging from
     the ceiling.]

     I:
          Then get after it. That's the man.
     [They rush out of the cottage and pursue the tractor.]

     Withnail:
          Hey, stop!
     I:
          Stop
     Withnail:
          Stop
     I:
          Stop please!
     [The tractor driver notices them and stops.]

     Withnail:
          Stop please! Please stop!
     [They run up to the side of the tractor and address the driver, Mr
     Parkin.]

     Withnail:
          Are you the farmer? [To I] Shut up, I'll deal with this. [to
          Parkin] We've gone on holiday by mistake. We're in this cottage
          here. Are you the farmer?
     I:
          Stop saying that Withnail, of course he's the fucking farmer. [To
          Parkin] We're friends of Montague Withnail, we desperately need
          fuel and wood.
     [The farmer shakes his head, bewildered.]

     I:
          Montegue Withnail, you must know him. Fat man, owns the cottage.
     Parkin:
          Ay, seen the fat man. London type. Queer sort. Think his name's
          French or something.
     Withnail:
          French!?
     Parkin:
          Ay, Adrian de la Touche. He hasn't been up year for couple of
          years. Last time I saw him, he were; he were with his son.
     I:
          Yeah, that's him.
     Withnail:
          Listen, we're bona fide. We're not from London. Could we have
          some fuel and wood?
     Parkin:
          Ay, I could bring you up some logs later but I've got the cows
          and that to feed first.
     Withnail:
          When?
     I:
          Shut up. That would be very kind of you. Erm, what about food? Do
          you think you could sell us something to eat?
     Parkin:
          I could bring you up a chicken but you'll have to go to the
          village really.
     I:
          That would be very kind of you Mr?
     Parkin:
          Parkin
     I:
          Mr Parkin. What happened to your leg?
     Parkin:
          Got a randy bull up there. Give me one in knee!
     [They walk back inside. I claps Withnail on the back. Back inside,
     Withnail removes his boots and places them in the oven attached to the
     fire.]

     I:
          You want to get out the back don't you? Get some spuds up.
     Withnail:
          Sorry I can't. My boots are in the oven
     I:
          You'd go if you had boots?
     Withnail:
          Gladly
     [Withnail emerges from the back door with polythene bags tied around
     his feet. He walks into the garden and after a little unearths a
     potato.]

     Withnail:
          I've got one!
     [Later, the potatoes are peeled and ready to be cooked. I sits reading
     'Journey's end' while Withnail dozes in front of the fire. I hears the
     tractor once again and goes out to meet Parkin. He is there with some
     logs.]

     I:
          Great. How much do we own you?
     Parkin:
          Pay us when you come down
     I:
          What about this chicken?
     Parkin:
          's on back
     [Back inside I has left the chicken on the table. It is alive and
     looks round questioningly. He nudges Withnail to wake him.]

I:
     Oye! Oye! Parkin's been. There's the supper!
Withnail:
     What are we supposed to do with that?
I:
     Eat it
Withnail:
     Eat it!? Fucker's alive
I:
     Yeah, you've got to kill it.
Withnail:
     Me!? I'm the firelighter and fuel collecter.
I:
     Yeah I know but I got the logs in. It takes away your appitite just
     looking at it.
Withnail:
     No it doesn't I'm starving. How can we make it die?
I:
     You've got to throttle them. Withnail, I think you ought to kill it
     instantly in case it starts trying to make friends with us.
Withnail:
     Alright, you get hold of ir. I'll strangle it.
I:
     I can't. Those dreadful, beady eyes! They stare you out!
Withnail:
     It's a bloody chicken. Just think of it with bacon across its back!
     Right, I'll deal with this. You'll have to get its guts out.

[Later, I is washing his hands in the sink having finished getting the
chickens guts out. Withnail enters with a shotgun and points it at I's
head.]

I:
     Never point guns at people. Extremely dangerous. Now what about this
     roasting dish? What are we going to cook it in?
Withnail:
     You're the food and plummings man. I've no idea. I wish I'd found this
     an hour ago. I'd have taken great pleasure in gunning this pullet
     down.

[He pokes the chicken with the gun. It still has a few feathers.]

Withnail:
     Shouldn't it be more bald than that?
I:
     No it shouldn't. Right, we're going to have to reverse the roles. We
     can bake the potatoes in the oven and boil this bastard over the fire.

[He tries to push the chicken into a kettle but it is too large to fit.]

Withnail:
     Lets get its feet off
I:
     No, it's going to need it's feet.

[He removes the chicken and takes it to the fire. Opening the oven, he
removes Withnail's steaming boots and points the the brick in the oven.]

I:
     Straddle them either side of that.

[He sits the chicken on the brick.]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A phonebox

[I is smoking stood outside the phonebox waiting for Withnail.]

     Withnail:
          I've already put two shilling pieces in. No I havn't got another.
          It's not my fault if the system doesn't work.
[He emerges from the phonebox.]
     Withnail:
          Bitch hung up on me.
[I fishes around in his pocket and finds a shilling for Withnail who goes
back into the phonebox and dials.]

     Withnail:
          Hello. How are you? Very well. What! Why wouldn't they see me?
          This is ridiculous. I haven't been up in a job for three months.
          Understudy Constantine!? I'm not going to understudy Constantine,
          why can't I play the part? This is ridiculous. No, I'm not in
          London, Penryth. Penryth! Well, what about TV? Listen, I pay you
          ten percent to do that. Well lick ten percent of the arses for
          me. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? How dare you! Fuck you.
[He takes out his frustration on the phone, hitting it for a while then
leaves the phonebox.]

     Withnail:
          Bastard asked me to understudy Constantine in The Seagull. I'm
          not going to understudy anyone, especially that little pimp.
          Anyway, I loath those Russian plays. Always full of women
          starring out of windows whinning about ducks going to Moscow.
[Returning from Penryth they walk accross a field. I is carrying some
shopping.]

     Withnail:
          What do you think to Desmond Wolf?
     I:
          With respect to what?
     Withnail:
          I'm thinking of changing my name.
     I:
          Too like Donald Woolfe
[He hands the bag to Withnail and opens a gate. It is clearly marked 'Shut
this gate']

     I:
          Here, changeover point.
[Withnail slams the gate behind them but it doesn't fasten. They see Parkin
on his tractor.]

     Withnail:
          Do you think he's happier than us?
     I:
          No
     Withnail:
          I suppose happiness is relative. I never thought it would be a
          polythene bag without the hole in it.
[Parkin turns the tractor towards them, stops and runs towards them.]

     I:
          What's up with him?
     Parkin:
          Shut that gate, shut that bull!
     I:
          You didn't shut the gate!
     Parkin:
          Shut that gate, shut that bull!
[A bull appears and pushes the gate open. Withnail thrusts the bag into I's
hands and vaults the wall. I is left facing the bull in a narrow corridor
between two walls.]

     Withnail:
          Grab its ring. Keep your bag up. Outvive him.
     Parkin:
          Hey, listen, show no fear! Just run at it
     I:
          Well that can't be sensible can it? The bastard's about to run at
          me
     Parkin:
          Well he's randy!
     I:
          Yeah, yeah. I know he is
[Withnail has his cigarettes out and is lighting up.]

     Withnail:
          Wants to get down there and have sex with those cows.
     I:
          Shut up Withnail!
     Parkin:
          Just run at it, shouting!
     Withnail:
          Do as he says, start shouting. It won't gore you
     I:
          A coward you are Withnail. An expert on bulls you are not!
[He shouts and throws the shopping in the air. The bull roars, I shouts
again and runs at it. It turns and retreats to its field.]

     Parkin:
          Shut that gate and keep it shut.
     Withnail:
          I think an evening at the Crow!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fields

[It is dark. The silloutes of Withnail and I appear on the skyline.]

     I [narrating]:
          If the Crow and Crown had ever had life it was dead now. It was
          like walking into a lung. A self-sustained nicotin-yellow and
          fly-blown lung. Its landlord was a retired alcoholic with
          military pretentions and a complection like the inside of a
          teapot. By the time the doors opened he was arseholed on rum and
          got progresively more arseholed until he could take no more and
          fell over at about twelve 'o' clock.

The Crow and Crown

[Withnail and I are stood at the bar.]

     Withnail:
          We'll have another pair of large scotches.
[Raymond, the publican, gets the drink and takes the money for them. In
opening the till he just avoids falling over. Withnail and I suppress
laughter.]

     Raymond:
          Thought I was going for a minute but no man's put me down yet.
          Have you had any training in the martial arts?
     Withnail:
          Yes, as a matter of I have. Before I became a journalist I was in
          the terretorials.
     Raymond:
          Do you know, when you first came in here I knew you were a
          services man. You can never, never disguise it.
     Withnail:
          What were you in?
     Raymond:
          Tanks. Afrika Korps. A little before your time. Don't suppose
          you've engaged.
     Withnail:
          Ireland.
     Raymond:
          Ooooh, a crack at the Mick.
     Withnail:
          We'll have another pair of large scotches
     Raymond:
          These shall be my pleasure. What are you doing up here then?
     Withnail:
          We're doing a feature for Country Life. Survey of rural types:
          farmers, traveling tinkers, milkmen; that sort of thing.
     Raymond:
          Have you met Jake? Poacher. Works the lake but keep it under your
          hat, hmm?
[They take their drinks to a table.]

     I:
          What's all this army bollocks?
     Withnail:
          We got a drink didn't we?
[Rather later, the pair are the only remaining customers. Raymond, wiping
down the bar, is clearly leggless.]

     Raymond:
          Time please gentlemen.
     I:
          I think he means it
[The door clatters open and a man in a thick coat walks in, leans over the
bar and helps himself to a beer. I nudges Withnail. The man takes an eel
from his trousers which wriggles around violently. He strikes its head on
the bar and returns it to his trousers.]

     I:
          Ask him if we can have one
     Withnail:
          What for?
     I:
          So that we can eat it! 'We're fed up with stew'
[They approach the bar.]

     Withnail:
          Excuse me, could we have an eel? You've got eels down your leg
     Jake:
          You leave them alone. Nothing down there of interest to you.
[He removes a pheasant from under his coat.]

     Help us out Raymond. He's been stuffed from arsehole to t' beak.
     I:
          Ask him if we can have one of those. Go on.
     Withnail:
          Excuse me, we were wondering if we could purchase a pheasant off
          of you
     Jake:
          No.
     Withnail:
          Come on old boy. What's in your hump?
     Jake:
          Those pheasants are for his pot. There eels are for my pot. Now
          what makes you think I should give you something for your pot?
     Withnail:
          What pot?
     I:
          Our cooking pot.
     Jake:
          Ah, he know. Here, give us a wheeze on that fag.
[He takes the cigarette from Withnail's mouth and takes a draw. I gives him
the remains of a packet.]

     Jake:
          Might come up and see you lads in the week . Might bring you up a
          rabbit.
     Withnail:
          We don't want a rabbit, we want a pheasant.
     Jake:
          Now listen here you young prat. Haven't got no pheasants. Haven't
          got no birds. No more than you have.
     Withnail:
          Of course you have, you're the poacher.
     Jake:
          If I hear more words out of you I'll come up and set one of these
          black puddin's on you
     Withnail:
          Don't threaten me with a dead fish
     Jake:
          Half dead he might be, but I'll come up after you and wake you up
          with a live one.
     Withnail:
          Sod your pheasants. You'll have to find us first.
[They make to leave]

     Jake:
          I know where you are. You're at crow crag. I've been wathching
          you. Especially you, prancing like a tit. You want working on
          boy. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Withnail:
          if i see that sillage heap prowling around here i'll take the
          bastard axe to him. bastards. you'll all suffer. i'm going to be
          a star!
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Withnail:
          Vegtables again. I'll be sprouting feelers soon
     I:
          There's black pudding in it.
     Withnail:
          Black puddings are no good to us. I want somethings flesh!
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Withnail:
          I think I'll call myself Donald Twain. Get down, get down. It's
          him, what does he want?
     I:
          Better get down there and ask him.
     Withnail:
          Don't be ridiculous, he's got a gun. Bastard's phycotic, you've
          only got to look at him.
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Withnail:
          this place has become impossible. Nothing to eat, freezing cold
          and now a madman on the prowl outside with eels.
     I:
          alright you've made your point. we pack up tomorrow and get out.
     Withnail:
          where are you going?
     I:
          I'm going for a slash
     Withnail:
          you can't go outside, i can't get my boots on when they're hot.
     I:
          then i'll go alone
     Withnail:
          no you won't these are the sort of windows faces look in at.
     I:
          alright then i won't have a slash
     Withnail:
          and in both our interests i think we should sleep together
          tonight.
     I:
          don't be ridiculous he;s not going to come up here in the dark.
     Withnail:
          yes he is and if he catches one of us off guard he's got a much
          better chance of dealing with the other.
     I:
          no
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     I:
          ha ha ha ha ha
     Withnail:
          what are you laughing about
     I:
          i was dreaming
     Withnail:
          you frightened the piss out of me. move over
     I:
          will you get out
     Withnail:
          no
     I:
          alright, i'll have to sleep in your bed
     Withnail:
          then i'll have to come with you
     I:
          alright you can stay but the gun goes
     Withnail:
          no, i have to keep the gun . i intend to stay awake until
          morning.
     I:
          it's my bed and i demand presidence. mad fucking bastard
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     I:
          ah ah. what.
     Withnail:
          i heard a noise.
     I:
          there is nothing get to bed. what was that?
     Withnail:
          listen listen
     I:
          probably just foxes. perhaps its the farmer
     Withnail:
          at two in the morning? it's the killer. he's come to kill us.
          it's all your fault, you've even given him the fucking gun. I've
          got to get in. He's trying to get in.
     I:
          He can't, he'll go away. He's going away.
     Withnail:
          He's getting in thorough the window. He's sharpening the fucking
          knife
     I:
          where's the matches?
     Withnail:
          in the kitchen.
     I:
          alright. we'll have to tackle with him. you stay in bed and
          pretend to be asleep. when he goes for you i'll jump on his back.
     Withnail:
          no no, it'll be too late by then, i'll be knifed. we'll have to
          try and make friends with him. He's going to your room. it's you
          he wants. offer him yourself! we mean no harm.
     Monty:
          oh my boys, my boys.
     I:
          monty! monty monty!
     Withnail:
          monty you terrible cunt. what are you doing prowling round in the
          middle of the fucking night?
     Monty:
          i had a punctured tyre. i had to wait an eon for assistance. i'm
          sorry if i frightened you. i'll sleep in the other room if i may
     I:
          anywhere you like Monty
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Monty:
          ah, good morning. did you sleep well?
     I:
          mmmm. you've been busy in here
     Monty:
          as a bee. I do appologise for last night, it was perfectly
          inconsidereate of me.
     I:
          that's perfectly alright monty. how did you repair the window?
     Monty:
          didn't break it. merely forced it a little. there was an empty
          wine bottle on the ledge. tomatoes. you better wake him,
          breakfast in fifteen minutes.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Monty:
          The older order changeth giving way to the new and God forfills
          himself in many ways and soon, I suppose, I shall be swept away
          by some vulgar little tumor. My boys, we are at the end of an
          age. We live in a land of weather forcasts and breakfasts that
          set in. Shat on by Tories, shovelled up by labour. Now which of
          you is going to be a splendid fellow and go down to the Rolls for
          the rest of the wine?
     I:
          I'll go.
     Withnail:
          I'll go.
     I:
          No, I'll go - I need to see about digging the car out.
     Monty:
          But we have my car dear boy.
     I:
          Yes, but if it rains we're buggered. I mean...
     Monty:
          Stranded!
     Withnail:
          Leave this to me
     I:
          I'll come with you, I could do with a walk. Besides. I shall need
          you to work on the joint. I hear you're a little wizard in the
          kitchen.
     Withnail:
          Yeah, you the food and plumbings expert. [He starts putting his
          polythene bags on.]
     Monty:
          What on earth are those?
     Withnail:
          We forgot to bring our wellingtons.
     Monty:
          You mean you've been up here in all this beastly mud and oomska
          without wellingtons? This afternoon I'll take you both into
          Penryth and get you fitted with some good quality rubber boots.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The kitchen. [Monty has an apron on and is holding another.]
     Monty:
          I brought two of these in case either of you were any good in the
          kitchen.
     I:
          I'm not.
     Monty:
          Oh, of course you are. Cooking's one of the natural talents.
          Garlic, rosemary and salt. [He hands I a large joint of meat in a
          paper wrapper. I puts it down on the side.]
     I:
          Look this is all very kind of you Monty but I really ought to be
          out there getting some work done on the car.
     Monty:
          You haven't time we're taking late luncheon at three.
     I:
          We'll have to leave by three Monty. Didn't he tell you? We've got
          to get back to sign on.
     Monty:
          Sign on!? At a labour exchange!?
     I:
          Yes, it's rather fashionable actually. All the actors do it. Even
          Redgrave.
     Monty:
          Couldn't you forgo for just this one occasion? I've come a very
          long way to see you both.
     I:
          Sorry can't. I mean, I'd love to stay but he's more adament to
          get back than I am. [Monty slips the apron over I's head and ties
          it behind him.]
     Monty:
          Then we must choose our moment and have a word with him. I'm sure
          together we could persuade him. Now, garlic, rosemary and salt. I
          can never touch meat until it's cooked. As a youth I used to weep
          in butchers shops. [I moves through to the lounge and looks in
          the bags of food on the table.]
     I:
          I can't find the rosemary.
     Monty:
          Can't find the rosemary! I'm sure we could find it together. [He
          leans accross I in a rather comprimising fashion.]
     I:
          perhaps it's in the other bag.
     Monty:
          Perhaps it is. Shall we look? [He reaches accross with his other
          arm cutting of any opatunity of escape. Withnail enters with the
          wine and puts the bags on the table.]
     Withnail:
          Sorry. Sherry's in there. [Monty exits to the kitchen armed with
          the sherry.]
     I:
          What do you mean sorry!? What's he doing here? We can't stay he
          won't leave me alone.
     Withnail:
          Alright, we'll get the dinner down then we'll leave. [In the
          kitchen Monty pulls the cork from the sherry and emerges with
          three different glasses.]
     Monty:
          I'm afraid we must drink from these. I hope their shapes will not
          offend your palates.
     Withnail:
          Chin chin.
     Monty:
          To a delightful weekend in the country.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Penryth [Monty's car drives into Penryth and pulls up in the town
          centre. Withnail and I get out of the car. Compared to Monty and
          the car they look rather scruffy.]
     Monty:
          I do think you could at least have shaved. What will people
          think, you look like a pair of farm-hands. Get away from the car.
          [He takes out his wallet and hands Withnail two fivers.]
     Monty:
          Now, you get the wellingtons. I'm going to but some razors and
          shaving soap. I'll meet you here in half an hour. [Monty drives
          off]
     Withnail:
          Couple of blooms.
     I:
          One each. [He removes a fiver from Withnail's hand]
     Withnail:
          I think a drink don't you?
     I:
          What about the wellingtons?
     Withnail:
          Oh, bollocks to the wellingtons. We'll tell him there was a
          farmer's conference and they had a run on them.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Inside the pub [I is on the telephone while Withnail is at the
          bar.]
     I:
          yeah, ok then. yeah. promise. [He puts down the phone and walks
          over to withail]
     I:
          Hasn't heard a thing. They're still seeing people.
     Withnail:
          You don't want to go to Manchester anyway; play a bloody soilder.
     I:
          I don't know if I do. Bloody good little theatre that.
     Withnail:
          It's not much of a part is it. They'd make you cut you hair off.
     I:
          So what, you'd loose a leg! BARMAN: time please gents.
     Withnail:
          Alright we're going to have to work quickly. A pair of quadruple
          whiskies and another pair of pints please.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [Withnail and I emerge unsteadily from the pub.]
     Withnail:
          Where is he. Utterly aresholed.
     I:
          We're early. [I looks accross to some tearooms]
     I:
          We want to get in there don't we. Eat some cake. Soak up the
          booze.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [They enter the Penryth tea-rooms. I sits down at a table and
          starts buttering the bread rolls on the table. Withnail, still
          standing, points to the table and addresses an elderly waitress,
          Miss Blennerhassit.]
     Withnail:
          Alright here? Miss B: No, we're closing in a minute.
     Withnail:
          We're leaving in a minute. Alright here? Miss B: What do you
          want? [He sits down at the table and makes a rather perfunctory
          examination of the menu.]
     Withnail:
          We'll have tea and cake. [An elderly man comes across to their
          table. He is the proprietor] P: Did you hear her? She said she'd
          closed. What do you want in here?
     Withnail:
          Cake and tea. what's it got to do with you? P: I happen to be the
          proprietor. Now, will you leave?
     Withnail:
          Ah good, I'm glad you're the proprietor. I was going to have to
          have a word with you anyway. We're doing a film up here, location
          see. We might want to do a film in here. P: You're drunk.
     I:
          Just bring out the cake.
     Withnail:
          Cake and fine wine. Miss B: If you don't leave we'll call the
          police.
     Withnail:
          Balls. We want the finest wines availible to humanity. We want
          them here and we want them now. P: The police, Miss
          Blennerhassit. [ I breaks off from stuffing breadrolls but hasn't
          quite emptied his mouth at the start]
     I:
          Don't do that Miss Blenerhassit. I'm warning you Miss
          Blennerhassit, if you do - you're fired. We are
          multi-millionaries. we'll buy this place and fire you
          immediately.
     Withnail:
          Yeah, that's right, we'll buy this place and install a fucking
          duke-box and liven all you stiffs up a bit. P: The police Miss
          Blenerhassit. Just tell them there are a couple of drunks in the
          Penryth tea rooms and we'd like them removed.
     I:
          We are not drunks, we are multi-millionaires. P: Come on Mabs,
          we'll keep them here until they arrive [She starts to dial]
     Withnail:
          You won't keep us anywhere. Miss B: Police please
     Withnail:
          We'll buy this place and have it knocked down.
     I:
          It's alright, 's alright. Our car has arrived. [He pulls back a
          curtain to reveal that indeed their car has arrived, in the form
          on Monty in the Rolls. They get up and I staggers out the door]
     Withnail:
          We're coming back in here. [He tries to lean on a convenient post
          but misses and staggers a bit. He points meaningfully at the
          various customers as he leaves, shutting his coat in the door.]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The cottage [Withnail and I are sat inside. There is no sign of
          Monte. I has just finished shaving and is rubbing his face with a
          towel.]
     I:
          Where is he?
     Withnail:
          Sulking up the hill. He says he won't come down for lunch without
          an appology.
     I:
          Suits me, he can eat his fucking radish. [Unseen, Monte enters
          and addresses I]
     Monty:
          It's all you fault.
     I:
          I beg your pardon Monte.
     Monty:
          You lead him astray. Oh don't pretend you don't understand, I
          know what you're up to. [Withnail stands up and offers Monte a
          glass]
     Withnail:
          Sherry?
     Monty:
          Sherry!? Oh no, no, no, no. I'll fall straight into his trap.
          He's so mauve we don't know what he'll do next. [I walks out in
          distgust as Monte sips the sherry.]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          the kitchen [I is at the sink peeling potatoes. Monte enters]
     Monty:
          I'm preparing myself to forgive you. I think you've been punished
          enough. I think we better release you from the legume and
          transfer you talents to the meat. [he takes him by the hand into
          the lounge]
     Monty:
          You shouldn't treat each other so badly. He's been working his
          fingers to the bone and all you do is sit in here drinking. Now,
          he's going to revitalize himself in here while you finish the
          vegtables.
     Withnail:
          I don't know how to do them.
     Monty:
          Well of course you don't. You're incapable of indulging in
          anything but pleasure am I not right? [I merely smiles]
     Monty:
          You don't deserve such loyalty. Now come along, I'm going to
          teach you how to peel a potato. [He rolls up Withnail's sleeves
          and takes him unwillingly into the kitchen. Withnail swipes a
          glass of sherry off the table on the way there.]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          the dinner table [All three are sat around the table eating a
          good looking roast dinner. There is plenty of extra meat and a
          good supply of wine.]
     Monty:
          It's very stimulating getting back to a basic sort of lifestyle.
          Without effecened emotion and poisonous inhibition.
     I:
          Except the problem do tend to take the edge off it.
     Monty:
          What do you mean?
     I:
          There are no proper facilities
     Monty:
          All the glorious trials of youth dear boy. When I was a lad I'd
          rocket off on my tandem with Wrigglesworth and ride and ride.
          Find some old barn and fall asleep with the sweet perfume of hay
          on our lips.
     Withnail:
          Would it be in poor form to plagarise a toast?
     Monty:
          It depend entirely on the quality of the wine. In this case, it
          most certainly would not.
     Withnail:
          In that case, to a delightful weekend in the country.
     Monty:
          Oooh, we were expecting a volley of argument concerning Mr
          Redgrave. [I gives Withnail a look of daggers]
     I:
          You're forgetting Jake.
     Monty:
          Jake can wait too.
     I:
          Jake's not a friend Monte. I'd hoped to avoid telling you this,
          but there's a madman on the loose outside.
     Monty:
          Is this true?
     Withnail:
          Well, there's this local type. Poacher. We got into a bit of a
          tiff and he threatened me with a dead fish. Yes, it was rather
          amusing acutally. When you came into the house we thought it was
          him and we thought that you cleaning your boots was him
          sharpening the knife.
     Monty:
          Oh, how delicious!
     I:
          I'm going for a walk.
     Monty:
          Oh, wait for us dear boy, we'll all go.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Outside the cottage [I is leaning on the wall. Withnail emerges
          and walks briskly over to him]
     Withnail:
          Look, I know what your thinking but I had no alternative. The old
          beggers come a long way and I didn't want to put the wind up him.
     I:
          You sensitivity overwhelms me. If you think you're having a
          weekends indulgence up here at his expense, which means him
          having a weekends induldgence up here at my expense you've got
          another thing coming.
     Withnail:
          Anyway, he sent me out to say the coffee's ready.
     I:
          I couldn't drink it. I've got a crick in my mouth from grinning.
     Withnail:
          Well stop smilling at him.
     I:
          I can't help it, I'm so uptight with him.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The hillside. [The are walking through thick bracken listening to
          Monte expound on Oxford.]
     Monty:
          Longtemps, longtemps de teau cheveux. Oh, Bodelair. Brings back
          such memories of Oxford. I [voice over] followed by yet another
          anecdote about his sensitive crimes in a punt with a chap called
          Norman who had ref hair and a poetry book stained with the butter
          drips from crumpets.
     Monty:
          Indeed I often wonder where Norman is now. Probably wintering
          with his mother in Guilford, a cat, rain, vim under the sink and
          both bars on. But old now, there is no true beauty without decay.
     Withnail:
          Legium pro Britania
     Monty:
          How right you are, how right you are. We live in a kingdom of
          (rains/reigns) where royalty comes in gangs. Come on lads, the
          sky's bruising, night must fall and we shall be forced to camp.
     I:
          He's having my room. I want the room with the lock. Agree to that
          or I'm off.
     Withnail:
          Alright, alright [They stride off back to the cottage. Before
          they get there, they see Jake at the door. Monte looks at him
          through the binoculars]
     I:
          Good old Jake eh? And that's precisely the reason I'm off back to
          London. Come on, lets pack up and get off. Good old Jake, eh
          Withnail. Lets all have a laugh. Good old Jake.
     Monty:
          He's going away. [They walk down to the cottage. There is a hare
          tied to the door with a note attached. Withnail unfolds the note
          and hands it to Monte. Monty clearly has some difficulty in
          reading the note.]
     Monty:
          Here hare here. [The meaning dawns on him.]
     Monty:
          Here hare here!
     Withnail:
          Good old Jake.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The cottage. [They are playing poker with bottle tops and a few
          coins. An old gramaphone is plaing in the background. The game is
          stud with two down cards - Monty has the ace of spades and two
          small spades showing, I just queen high]
     Monty:
          Ace bets two and it's over to you.
     Withnail:
          You two and up two.
     I:
          So that's four?
     Monty:
          That's four. [I puts in four. Monty deals the last set of cards.]
     Monty:
          ?
     Withnail:
          Denai surenum defit. [He deals I another queen to I]
     Monty:
          Oh, there she is. [He deals himself another spade]
     Monty:
          A possible flush. Well, it's the two queens to bet!
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [Still at the table, Monty winds up the gramaphone.]
     Monty:
          Another hand? [Withnail looks up and slumps in his chair. He is
          totally plastered.]
     Monty:
          I think we'd better get him to bed.
     I:
          No, he's down here. You're in my room, I'm in his room and he's
          down here.
     Monty:
          I wouldn't dream of depriving the poor fellow of his bed.
          Particularlly in that condition.
     I:
          It's what he wants!
     Withnail:
          No I don't I want to get to bed!
     I:
          Come on then luvy, lets get you to bed then. A good nights sleep
          will do us both some good. [He grabs Withnail under the arms and
          manouvers him out of the room.]
     I:
          We'll I'll say good night then Monty.
     Withnail:
          I want to be alone. [I staggers up the stairs with Withnail who
          mumers about wanting to be on his own. He drops him on the bed
          and dashes back to his own room to get his bedding. Before he can
          get back though Monty has come up the stairs and just finished
          locking the door.]
     Monty:
          He doesn't want to sleep with you.
     I:
          Right then, You're in there and I'll take the couch. I'll say
          night night then Monty.
     Monty:
          You already have. Twice!
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [Downstairs I frantically aranges the blankets on the settee.
          Monty enters]
     I:
          What is it Monty, I'm terribly tired I need to get to bed.
     Monty:
          But not that tired eh? Are you a sponge or a stone?
     I:
          I beg you pardon Monty?
     Monty:
          Do you like to sample all facets of life or do you shut yourself
          off from new experience.
     I:
          I voted conserative
     Monty:
          Loyalty isn't a matter of selection.
     I:
          I quite agree, it's more a matter of chosing to whom one is
          loyal. I'm terribly tired Monty, I need to get to bed.
     Monty:
          You must mustn't you. Off you go then. I'll sleep down here. It
          won't be the first time I've been left with the couch!
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [I is in bed. He has barricaded the door by propping a chair
          against the knob. There is a determined pushing at the door from
          the other side which dislodges the chair and Monty enters.]
     Monty:
          Boy! Boy! I know you're not asleep boy. But he is. I've been into
          his room. He won't hear a thing.
     I:
          No I'm not asleep. What is it Monty, what do you want. [I lights
          a candle. Monty sits down on the side on the bed.]
     Monty:
          I tried not to come, oh how I tried not to.
     I:
          There's something I've got to tell you Monty.
     Monty:
          There's no need to explain, he's told me everything.
     I:
          What! What's he told you?
     Monty:
          About how you came to Chelsea and you arrest in the totenham
          court road. He told me about your probelms, how you feel.
     I:
          Probelms, what problems?
     Monty:
          You are a toilet trader! Go with it boy, give into to it. It's
          like a tide. Don't let it ruin your youth as I nearly did over
          Eric.
     I:
          I'm not homosexual Monty
     Monty:
          Yes you are! Of course you are. You're only saying that to deny
          your relationship with him. It's not his fault that he can't love
          you any more that it's mine that I adore you. Can't we allow
          ourselves this one moment of indiscretion? He need never know.
     I:
          I don't care what he knows, you must leave Monty. [I gets out of
          bed and goes over to the door. Monty beats him to it.]
     Monty:
          I mean to have you even if it must be burgulary. [I races to the
          other side of the room. Monty advances.]
     I:
          Monty you must listen! We're in an affair, we have been for
          years. But he's estranged, he won't allow himself to admit it.
          That's why he's rejecting me while you're here. On my life Monty,
          this is the first time in six years we havn't slept together. I
          couldn't cheat on him, it would kill him.
     Monty:
          Oh my dear boy, if I'd realised that I'd never have attempted to
          come between you.
     I:
          I know that Monty, I respected you for your sensitivity, I thank
          you for it.
     Monty:
          You better go to him
     I:
          Oh, I intend to. This instant.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Withnail's room [Withnail is asleep in bed with the shotgun. I
          enters]
     I:
          Withnail you bastard wake up. Wake up you bastard before I burn
          this bastard bed down.
     Withnail:
          I deny all accusations. What do you want?
     I:
          I've just narrowly avoided having a buggery. And I've come in
          here with the express intention of wishing one on you. That said,
          I'm leaving for London.
     Withnail:
          Hold on, hold on. Don't let you imagination run away with you.
          [He light up and coughs up some phlem]
     I:
          I've just finished fighting a naked man. How dare you tell him
          I'm a toilet trader!
     Withnail:
          Tatical necessity. If I hadn't told him you were active we'd
          never have got the cottage.
     I:
          I wouldn't have wanted it, not with him in it.
     Withnail:
          I never thought he'd come all this way.
     I:
          Monty!? He'd go to New York.
     Withnail:
          Calcualted risk.
     I:
          What is all this calculated risk and tactical necessity. It's me,
          naked, in a corner. And how dare you tell him I love you? And how
          dare you tell him you rejected me? How dare you tell him that!?
     Withnail:
          Sorry about that, got a bit carried away. Sort of said it without
          thinking. [I takes the gun]
     I:
          Well let me tell you something Withnail, if he comes in my room
          again its murder and you'll be held resposible in law.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The cottage [Withnail is eating lunch at the table. I is reading
          a note]
     I:
          'Perhaps it is just that the evesdropper should leave as his
          trade dictates, in secrecy and in the dead of night. I do
          sincerely hope that you will find the happiness that has saddly
          always been denied me. Yours faithfully, Montegue H Withnail.'
          Poor old bastard.
     Withnail:
          Now I must say, that represents a level of hippocrasy in you that
          I'd previously suspected but not noticed due to highly evasive
          skills.
     I:
          You'll suffer for this Withnail. What you have done will have to
          be paid for.
     Withnail:
          I'll say one thing for Monte; he keeps a sensational cellar.
          [There is a knock at the door.]
     I:
          Who is it. VOICE: Telegram. [I gets the telegram and opens it. He
          shows it to Withnail]
     Withnail:
          Well done.
     I:
          Well it doesn't mean to say I've got the part. They probably just
          want to see me again. Well, that settles it, we leave
          immediately.
     Withnail:
          What!?
     I:
          Get you stuff together, we leave in half an hour.
     Withnail:
          Don't be ridiculous, I need at least an hour for lunch.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The car [Withnail is eating the lunch from a plate on his knee.
          It is raining heavinly and I's side of the windscreen is
          impossible to see through]
     Withnail:
          You got a truck coming up in this lane followed by a slow
          right-hander.
     I:
          This is insanity
     Withnail:
          Stay in this lane
     I:
          What lane, I can't see any lane.
     Withnail:
          Bear right, bear right.
     I:
          I can't keep this up. And I must get some sleep.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The car [It is daytime again, and the rain has stopped.I is
          asleep in the back on the car. The car jerks around and he woken.
          As he looks out the window, the camera moves with his view. The
          car is hurtling down the motorway swerving between the other
          cars.]
     I:
          What's going on?
     Withnail:
          I'm making time.
     I:
          Pull over, you haven't got a license.
     Withnail:
          No, I'm making time. Here comes another fucker. [They swerve
          infront of several more cars. Then I sees a police van behind
          them.]
     I:
          On no.
     Withnail:
          It's perfectly alright, leave him to me.
     I:
          You're full of scotch you silly tool. [The police van comes along
          side them and a policeman leans out pointing markedly to the
          roadside. Withnail pulls over, the van draws up in front on them
          and the officers approach the car. One knocks on the window and
          Withnail winds it down.] P1: Bit early in the morning for
          festivities isn't it sir? [There is a large pile of bottles on
          the passenger seat of the car]
     Withnail:
          They're not mine, they belong to him. P1: You're drunk.
     Withnail:
          I assure you I'm not officer, I've only had a few ales. P1: Out
          of the car. Please. Sir. [Withnail makes no move so he opens the
          door. Withnail virtually falls out then stands against the car.
          The policeman offers him a breathaliser] P1: Would you fill this
          bag please sir. [Withnail shakes his head] P1: Are you refusing
          to fill this bag?
     Withnail:
          I most certainly am P1: I'm placing you under arrest.
     Withnail:
          Don't be ridiculous I haven't done anything. Listen, my cousin's
          a QC. P2: Get in the back on the van.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Police station [Withnail is behind a screen. A sergant is sat at
          a desk while other policemen wonder around] P3: Serg, what's that
          clown up to? [The sergent pulls a gap in the screen and sees
          withnail with the contraption Danny gave him. He grabs the tube
          and urine splashes everywhere. Withnail grins sheepishly]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The flat [Withnail and I enter their flat. They look through the
          post]
     Withnail:
          Where's our checks?
     I:
          We didn't sign on.
     Withnail:
          That wouldn't make any difference to last weeks payments. [They
          hear music from upstairs. The door to the bathroom is ajar and in
          the bath is a large black man who looks at them inquiringly. I
          looks in his bedroom. The bed is occupied by Danny]
     I:
          What are you doing in my bed? D: Having a sleep.
     I:
          Who's the huge spade in the bath? D: Presuming Ed.
     I:
          Well I want you out. You've got ten minutes alright? Coz I want
          to get in.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The lounge [All four are sat in the lounge]
     Withnail:
          How did you get in? D: Inginuity man - come up the drainpipe.
          Would you like a smoke?
     Withnail:
          Yes
     I:
          No thanks, I've got a call to make. [Danny starts pulling out
          rizzlers at a prolific rate]
     Withnail:
          What are you going to do with those? D: The joint I am about to
          roll requires a craftsman and can utalise up to twelve spliffs.
          It is called a Camberwell carrot.
     I:
          It's imposible to use 12 papers on one joint. D: It is impossible
          to roll a camberwell carrot with anything less.
     Withnail:
          Who says it's a Camberwell carrot. D: I do. I invented it in
          Camberwell and it's shaped like a carrot. [Cut to Danny on the
          settee. The Camberwell carrot is complete and is indeed of
          prodidiuos proportions. As Danny lights it we see only the end
          but as he hands it to withnail we see the true size. It is
          enormous.] D: These will tend to make you very high. [Withnail
          takes a long draw] D: This grass is the most powerfull in the
          western hemisphere. It grows at exactly two thousand feet above
          sea-level. I have it special flown in from my man in Mexico. His
          name's Huang. He's an expert. [I returns from his phone call] D:
          Did you get the part man? [I takes a draw on the joint and
          splutters. He shakes his head]
     I:
          No, I got a different one. They want me to play the lead.
     Withnail:
          Congratulations. D: Where exactly have you two been?
     I:
          A trip to the countryside. D: That is a very good idea. London is
          a city coming down from its trip and there's going to be a lot of
          refugees. [Presuming Ed laughs deeply] D: Did you realise this
          gafs overrun with rodents? When I came in I saw one in the oven
          the size of a fucking dog.
     I:
          That is a dog, belongs to the man downstairs. D: Does his dog get
          in the oven.
     Withnail:
          No his dog doesn't come up here. D: Then it was a rodent. Quite
          freeked me at the time. I was going to cook onions. There was
          some bald gieser round here the other day reckoned you owed him
          235 quid backrent. I told him there was no question of paying
          rent on a property infested with rodent. Started coming on all
          bald with me.
     Withnail:
          You mean ratty. D: I told him to piss off.
     I:
          You bloody fool. He'll have us up in court again. D: No he won't,
          it's not legal.
     Withnail:
          We can quote you on that I presume. D: Law rather appeals to me
          actually. [Withnail laughs uncontrolably and drops to the floor]
          D: Just high.
     I:
          Stop laughing will you Withnail, this is serious. D: No it ain't.
          I looked into it. Studied the papers.
     I:
          What papers? D: Legal papers. [He shakes the papers out of a bag]
     I:
          Look, he's got our checks. What are you doing with these? D: I
          was going to pay them in for you.
     I:
          For christ'd sake Withnail, stop laughing will you. Look, this is
          a notice of eviction
     Withnail:
          Give it to my barrister. [Presuming Ed starts chanting and
          rotating a globe] Ed: Harriramma, Hariramma
     I:
          Shup up will you, you're giving me the fear! Give us a downer
          Danny, I've gone and fucked my brain. D: Sit down man, take
          control. You have a rush. It will pass.
     I:
          Aren't you getting absurdly high? D: Precisely the reason I'm
          smoking it.
     Withnail:
          I couldn't I'm spaced. D: Not as spaced as you rodents.
     I:
          Don't talk about them. D: I expect they're talking to each other.
     I:
          Talking to each other? What do you mean? D: I've dealt with them.
          Given 'em all drugged onion.
     I:
          Why've you drugged their onions!? D: Sit down man, find your
          neutral space. You have done something to your brain. You have
          made it high. If I lay 10 mills of diazipan on you, you will do
          something else to your brain, you will make it low. Why trust one
          drug rather than the other. That politics ain't it.
     I:
          I'm going to eat some sugar. D: I recommend you smoke some more
          grass.
     I:
          No way, no fucking way. D: That is an unfortunate political
          decission.
     Withnail:
          What are you talking about Danny? D: If you are holding onto a
          rising balloon you are presented with a difficult political
          decission - let go while you've still got the chance or hold onto
          the rope and continue getting higher. That's politics man. We are
          at the end of an age. The greatest decade in the history of
          mankind is nearly over. They're selling hippy wigs in wolworths.
          It is 91 days to the end of the decade and as presuming ed here
          has so consistently pointed out, we have failed to paint it
          black.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     I:
          Right, I'm off now.
     Withnail:
          Already?
     I:
          My father will pick up my stuff in the week and do something
          about the car.
     Withnail:
          But I've got us a bottle open. Confiscated it from Monte's
          supplies. 53 Margaux. Best of the century
     I:
          I can't Withnail, I'll miss the train.
     Withnail:
          There's always time for a drink.
     I:
          I haven't the time.
     Withnail:
          Alright, I'll walk with you to the station. We can drink it
          through the park. [He grabs his coat and an umbrella and takes
          the bottle.]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The Park [It is pouring down with rain. Withnail offer the bottle
          to I]
     I:
          No thankyou, no more. Look, it's a stinker Withnail, why don't
          you go home.
     Withnail:
          Because I want to walk you to the station.
     I:
          No, really, I really don't want you to. [They stop by the
          wolves.]
     I:
          I shall miss you Withnail.
     Withnail:
          I'll miss you too. [I departs. Withnail walks to the fence and
          leans against it.]
     Withnail:
          I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth and
          indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly
          frame the earth seems to me a sterile promotory; this most
          excellent canopy the air, look you, this mighty o'rehanging
          firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire; why, it
          appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of
          vapours. What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how
          infinite in faculties, how like an angel in aprehension, how like
          a God! The beauty of the world, paragon of animals; and yet to
          me, what is this quintessence of dusk. Man delights not me, no,
          nor women neither, nor women neither. [The wolves are
          unimpressed. Withnail exits into the rain.]
Withnail and I

Camden Town, London. 1969

The Flat.

[A few shafts of sunlight sneak through the curtains and illuminate a
sitting room. There are empty bottles everywhere. 'I', who is smoking a
joint, gets up somewhat precariously and walks into a kitchen which is full
of bottles and dirty washing up. He lights the gas on the stove and puts on
the kettle.]

['I' knocks on the door to Withnail's bedroom]

I:
     I'm having a cup of tea, do you want one?

[He waits for a response.]

I:
     Do you want a cup of tea Withnail!?
Withnail:
     No.

['I' leaves the flat, slamming the front door behind him]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cafe

['I' is reading a paper at a table in the cafe. The proprietor is cooking
eggs in a frying pan full of grease. She takes one out, inserts it between
two slices of bread and places it in front of an elderly woman who inspects
it doubtfully and bites into the sandwhich. Yolk runs out of the other
edge. 'I' turns his attention to his paper. The story is about a
transexual, the headline 'Love made up my mind, I had to become a woman'.
He looks around at the other customers.]

I [mentally]:
     Thirteen million Londoners have to cope with this, and bake beans and
     allbran and rape, and I'm sitting in this bloody shack and I can't
     cope with Withnail. I must be out of my mind. I must go home at once
     and discuss his problems in depth.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Flat

[I stumbles up the barely lit stairs looking unwell. Withnail emerges from
his room holding a bottle and glass and follows him.]

Withnail:
     I have some extremely distressing news.
I:
     I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear anything. Oh God, it's a
     nightmare out there I tell you.
Withnail [pouring some wine]:
     We've just run out of wine what are we going to do about it?
I:
     I don't know. I don't know. I don't feel good. Look! My thumbs have
     gone weird. I'm in the middle of a fucking overdose. My hearts beating
     like a fucked clock. I feel dreadful, I feel fucking dreadful.
Withnail:
     So do I. So does everyone. Look at my tongue. A grey yellow sock. Sit
     down for Christ's sake, what's the matter with you? Eat some sugar.

[I goes into the kitchen which is by now full of steam and turns off the
kettle. Withnail follows him around reading from a newspaper.]

Withnail:
     Listen to this. "Curse of the superman. I took drugs to win medals
     said top athlete Geoff Woade."
I:
     Where's the coffee?
Withnail [reading from the paper]:
     "In a world exclusive interview 33 year old shot putter Geoff Woade
     who weight 317 pounds, admitted taking massive doses of anabolic
     steroids, drugs banned in sport. It used to get him bad tempered and
     act down said his wife. He used to pick on me. But now he's stopped
     his much better in our sex life and in our general life."

[I pours water from the kettle into a bowl and goes back into the living
room. Withnail follows him.]

Withnail:
     My God, this huge, thatched head with its earlobes and cannonball is
     now considered sane. "Geoff Woade is feeling better and is now
     prepared to step back into society and start tossing his orb about."
     Look at him. Look at Geoff Woade. His head must weight fifty pounds on
     its own.

[Withnail stands infront of a mirror and brushes his long, greasy hair with
a comb. I sits on the settee and starts drinking the coffee from the bowl
using a spoon.]

Withnail:
     Imagine the size of his balls. Imagine getting into a fight with the
     fucker!
I:
     Please! I don't feel good.
Withnail:
     That's what you'd say but that wouldn't wash with Geoff. No! He'd like
     a bit of pleading. Add spice to it. In fact, he'd probably tell you
     what he was going to do before he did it. "I'm going to pull you head
     off". "Oh no, please, don't pull my head off". "I'm going to pull your
     head off because I don't like your head!"

[he notives I drinking from the bowl.]

Withnail:
     Have you got soup? Why didn't I get any soup?
I:
     Coffee
Withnail:
     Why don't you use a cup like any other human being?
I:
     Why don't you wash up occasionally like any other human being?
Withnail:
     How dare you!? How dare you!? How dare you call me inhumane!?
I:
     I didn't call you inhumane, you merely imagined it. Calm down.
Withnail:
     Right you fucker - I'm going to do the washing up!

[He strides towards the kitchen. I jumps over the arm of the settee and
stops him.]

I:
     No no you can't. It's impossible I swear it. I've looked into in.
     Listen to me listen to me. There are things in there, there's a
     tea-bag growing. You haven't slept in sixty hours you're in no state
     to tackle it. Wait till the morning we'll go in together.
Withnail:
     This is the morning. Stand aside!
I:
     You don't understand. I think there may be something alive.
Withnail:
     What do you mean? a rat?
I:
     It's possible, it's possible.
Withnail [brandishing his comb]:
     Then the fucker will rue the day!

[He rushes up the the sink.]

Withnail:
     Oh Christ Almighty. Synous nicotine based. Keep back, keep back. The
     entire sink's gone rotten. I don't know what's in here.

[He picks up the kettle from the stove then throws it suddenly into the
sink.]

I:
     I told you. you've been bitten!
Withnail:
     Burnt, burnt, the fucking kettle's on fire.
I:
     There's something floating up.
Withnail [with a fork in his hand]:
     Fork it!
I:
     No no no, I don't want to touch it.
Withnail:
     You must you must. The poop will boil through the glaze. We'll never
be able to use the dinner service again.

[He rumages about in a drawer.]

Withnail:
     Here, get it with the pliers!
I:
     No, no, no, no, no, no. Give me the gloves.
Withnail:
     That's right, put on the gloves. Don't attempt anything without the
     gloves.

[I starts to move things about in the sink rather gingerly.]

Withnail:
     What is it? What have you found?
I:
     Matter.
Withnail:
     Matter? Where's it coming from?
I:
     Don't look. Don't look. I'm dealing with it!
Withnail:
     I think we've been in here too long. I feel unusual. I think we should
go outside.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Park

[Withnail and I walk along a path in the park.]

Withnail:
     This is ridiculous, look at me. I'm thirty in a month and I've got a
     sole flapping off my shoe.
I:
     It'll get better, it has to.
Withnail:
     Easy for you to say lovey. You've had an audition. Why can't I have an
     audition. It's ridiculous: I've been to drama school. I'm good
     looking. I tell you, I've a fuck sight more talent that half the
     rubbish that gets of TV. Why can't I get on TV?
I:
     Well I don't know. It'll happen.
Withnail:
     Will it? That's what you say. The only programme I'm likely to get on
     is the fucking news. I tell you, I can't take much more of this. I'm
     going to crack.
I:
     I'm in the same boat.
Withnail:
     Yeah, yeah. I feel as sick as a pike. I'm going to have to sit down.

[ They sit at a bench in the park.]

I:
     You know what we should do? I say, you know what we should do?
Withnail:
     How should I possibly know what we should do? What should we do?
I:
     Get out of it for a while. Get into the countryside. Rejuvenate.
Withnail:
     Rejuvenate! I'm in a park and I'm practically dead. What good's the
     countryside? What time is it?
I:
     It's eight.
Withnail:
     Fours hours to opening time. God help us. Have we got any embrocation?
I:
     What for?
Withnail:
     To rub on ourselves you fool. We'll cover ourselves in deep heat and
     get up against a radiator. Keep ourselves alive until twelve.

[He spits.]

Withnail:
     Jesus, look at that. Apart from a raw potato that's the only solid to
     have passed my lips in the last sixty hours. I must be ill.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Flat

[I is writting in a notebook on the settee while Withnail wonders round
wearing his overcoat and his underpants, smearing himself with deep heat.]

I [mentally]:
     Even a stopped clock tells the right time twice a day. And for once
I'm inclined to believe Withnail is right; we are indeed drifting into the
arena of the unwell. Making an enemy of our own future. What we need is
harmony. Fresh air. Stuff like that.
Withnail:
     Wasn't much in the tube. there's nothing left for you.
I:
     Why don't you ask your father for some money. If we had some money we
could go away.
Withnail [inspecting a bottle for dregs]:
     Why don't you ask your father. How can it be so cold in here. It's
like Greenland in here. We've got to get some booze. It's the only solution
to this intense cold. Something's got to be done. We can't go on like this.
I'm a trained actor reduced to the status of a bum. I mean look at us!
Nothing that reasonable members of society demand as their rights! No
fridges, no televisions, no phones. Much more of this and I'm going to
apply for meals on wheels.
I:
     What happened to your cigar commercial?
Withnail:
     That's what I want to know. what happened to my cigar commercial. What
happened to my agent? Bastard must have died.
I:
     September. Bad patch.
Withnail:
     Rubbish. Haven't seen Gylgod down the labour exchange. Why doesn't he
retire.

[He picks up a paper.]

Withnail:
     Look at this little bastard. Boy lands plumb role for top Italian
     director. Of course his does. Probably on a tenner a day and i know
     what for: Two pound ten a tit and a fiver for his arse.

[He points accusingly at I.]

Withnail: Have you been at the controls!?
I:
     What are you talking about?
Withnail:
     The thermostats. what have you done to them?
I:
     I haven't touched them.
Withnail:
     Then why has my head gone numb. I must have some booze. I demand to
     have some booze.

[He lunges towards the mantlepiece where there is a bottle of lighter
fluid.]

I [standing up]:
     I wouldn't drink that if I were you.
Withnail:
     Why not?
I:
     Because I don't advise it. Even the wankers on the site wouldn't drink
     that. That's worse than meths.
Withnail:
     Nonsense, this is a far superior drink to meths. The wankers don't
     drink it because they can't afford it.

[He pours the contents of the bottle into his upturned mouth.]

Withnail:
     Ah. Ah. Have you got anymore?

[I shakes his head. Withnail presses forwards and I backs off.]

Withnail:
     Liar, what's in your toolbox?
I:
     No we have nothing. Sit down!
Withnail:
     Liar, you've got antifreeze.
I:
     You bloody fool. You should never mix your drinks! [Withnail laughs
     histerically, collapses to the floor and emits unpleasant vomitting
     noises.]
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Street

     [They walk towards a rather rough looking pub: 'The Old Mother
     Blackcap'.]

     Withnail:
          All right, this is the plan. We get in there and get wrecked.
          Then we'll eat a pork pie. Then we drop a couple of soamser
          fifties each; means we'll miss out Monday but come up smilling
          Tuesday morning. What's that appalling smell?
     I:
          Perfume on my boots. I had to scrub the with essence of petunia.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Pub

     [Withnail moves somewhat precariously to the bar. The pub is a simple
     affair with a few men sat round at tables drinking.]

     Withnail:
          Two large gins, two pints of cider. Ice in the cider.
     I:
          If my father was loaded I'd ask him for some money.
     Withnail:
          If your father was my father you wouldn't get it.
     Barman:
          : There you are lads.
     Withnail:
          Chin chin.
     [Withnail chinks his glass against the other, which I has not picked
     up yet, and downs the gin in one. I follows suit but gags slightly.]

     I:
          Ugh. What about what-his-name?
     Withnail:
          What about him?
     I:
          Why don't you give him a call.
     Withnail:
          What for?
     I:
          Ask him about his house.
     Withnail:
          You want me to call what-his-name and ask him about his house?
     I:
          Why not?
     Withnail:
          Alright. what's his number?
     I:
          I've no idea - I've never met him.
     Withnail:
          Well neither have I. What the fuck are you talking about?
     I:
          Your relative with a house in the country.
     Withnail:
          Monty? Uncle Monty?
     I:
          That's him. That's the one. Get the Jag fixed up. Spend the
          weekend in the country.
     Withnail:
          Alright. Give us a tenner and I'll give him a bell.
     I:
          Get a couple more in. I'm going for a slash.
     [Next to the door to the gents is a rather large Irish man sat with
     his pint and his paper.]

     Big Irish man:
          Ponce
     [I ignores him and goes into the gents.]

     I [to himself]:
          I could hardly piss straight with fear. he was a man with 3/4 of
          an inch of brain who'd taken a dislike to me. What had I done to
          offend him? I don't consciously offend big men like this. And
          this one's a decided imbalance of hormone in him. Get any more
          masculine than that and you'd have to live up a tree. [he reads
          the grafitti] 'I fuck arses', Who fucks arses? [aloud] Maybe he
          fucks arses. [to himself again] Maybe he's written this in some
          moment of drunken sincerity. I'm in considerable danger in here.
          I must get out of here at once.
     [He walks back into the bar.]

     Big Irish man:
          Perfumed ponce!
     [Withnail is still at the bar. He has made considerable progress with
     his cider and is eating some snack.]

     Withnail:
          You'll be pleased to hear Monte's invited us for drinks.
     I:
          Balls to Monty we're getting out.
     Withnail:
          Balls to Monty!? I've just spent an hour flattering the bugger.
     I:
          There's a man over there doesn't like the perfume. The big one.
          Don't look, don't look. We're in danger, we've got to get out.
     Withnail:
          What are you talking about?
     I:
          I've been called a ponce.
     [Withnail turns to address the room in general.]

Withnail:
     What fucker said that!?

[The large Irish gentleman in the corner gets up and walks over to them.
Now he is upright we see he is very large indeed and does not look
friendly.]

Big Irish man:
     I called him a ponce. And now I'm calling you one. Ponce!
Withnail (smiling):
     Would you like a drink?
Big Irish man:
     What's your name McFuck!?

[As he says this he jerks the scarf from around Withnail's neck.]

Withnail:
     I've a heart condition. I've a heart condition. If you hit me it's
     murder!
Big Irish man:
     I'll murder the pair of y'ers.
Withnail:
     My wife's having a baby. Listen, I don't know what my f.. [he starts
     to say friend but decides on a better course of action] acquaintance
     did to upset you but it's nothing to do with me. I suggest you both go
     outside and discuss it sensibly, in the street.

[They push past the man and rush to the door.]

Withnail:
     Ahhhh, out of my way.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Bathroom

[I is in the bath shaving.]

I:
     Speed is like a dozen transatlantic flights without ever getting off
     the plane. Timechange. You lose, you gain. Makes no difference so long
     as you keep taking the pills. But sooner or later you've got to get
     out because it's crashing then all at once the frozen hours melt out
     through the nervous system and seep out the pores.

[Withnail enters with their lunch from the chippy]

Withnail:
     The bastards. Justice suck. It's a miserable cheap cigar and the
     bastards won't see me.
I:
     Why are we having lunch in here?
Withnail:
     It's dinner and Danny's here.
I:
     Danny!? How did he get in?
Withnail:
     I let him in this morning. He lost one of his clogs. He's come in
     because of the perpetual cold. I hope the buggers sales plummet.
I:
     I've got your savaloy. Here. I don't want it.
Withnail:
     Then stick it in the soap tray and save it for later.

[He scrunches up the paper that was holding his chips and puts it in the
toilet]

I:
     Don't vent spleen on me. I'm in the same boat.
Withnail:
     Stop saying that. You're not in the same boat. The only thing you're
     in that I've been in is this fucking bath.
I:
     Danny's here. Head hunter to his friends. Head hunter to everybody. He
     doesn't have any friends. The only people he converses with are his
     clients and occasionally the police. The purveyor of rare herbs and
     prescribed chemicals is back. Will we never be set free?
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Flat

     [I comes out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel.]

     I:
          Danny.
     Danny:
          You're looking very beautiful man. Have you been away? St. Peter
          preached the epistles to the apostles looking like that. Have you
          got any food.
     I:
          Mmm, As a matter of fact, got a savaloy.
     Danny:
          How much is it?
     I:
          You can have it for nothing.
     [Danny sniffs the sausage. Withnail enters from the kitchen gluing the
     sole back on his shoe. He is wearing a rather expensive looking suit.]

Danny:
     I see you're wearing a suit.
Withnail:
     What's it got to do with you?
Danny:
     No need to get uptight man. I was merely making an observation. I
     happened to be looking for a suit for the coal man two weeks ago. For
     reasons I can't really discuss with you the coal man had to go to
     Jamaica. Got busted coming back through Heathrow, had the weight under
     his fez. We wored out that it would be handycarma for him to get hold
     of a suit but he's a very low temperature spade the coal man, went
     into court wearing a kaftan and a bell. This doesn't go down at all
     well. They can handle the kaftan but they can't handle the bell. So
     there's this judge sitting there sitting in a cape like fucking batman
     with this really rather far out looking hat
Withnail:
     A wig.
Danny:
     No man, this was more like a long white hat. So he looks at the
     coalman and says 'what's all this. This is a court man. This ain't
     fancy dress' and the coal man looks at him and says 'you think you
     look normal, your honour?'. Cunt give him two years.

[I laughs a little. Withnail looks on unamuzed.]

Danny:
     I'm afraid I can't offer you gentlemen anything.
I:
     That's alright Danny. We'd decided to lay off for a bit.
Danny:
     That's what I thought. Except for personal use I concur with you. as a
     matter of fact i was thinking of retiring and going into business
Withnail [Scoffing]:
     Doing what?
Danny:
     The toy industry.

[There is a stange looking contraption on the table involving a bottle.]

Withnail:
     Thought you were in the bottle industry.
Danny:
     No man, that's a side line. You can have that. Instructions are
     included. Yeah. My partner's got a really good idea for making dolls.
     His name's 'Presuming Ed'. His sister give him the idea. She got a
     doll on Christmas what pisses itself.
Withnail:
     Really.
Danny:
     Then you've got to change its draws for it. Horrible really but
     they're like that the little girls. So we're going to make one that
     shits itself too.
Withnail:
     Shits itself!?
Danny:
     He's an expert. He's building the prototype now. [To I] Why's he
     behaving so uptightly.
Withnail:
     Because a gang of cheroot vendors consider a hair cut beyond the limit
     of my abilities
Danny:
     I don't advise a hair cut man. All hairdressers are in the employment
     of the government. Hair are your aerials. They pick up signals from
     the cosmos and transmit them directly into the brain. This is the
     reason bold-headed men are uptight.
Withnail:
     What absolute twaddle.
Danny:
     Has he just been busted?
I:
     No.
Danny:
     Then why's he wearing that old suit?
Withnail:
     Old suit? This suit was cut by Hawke's of Saville row. Just because
     the best tailoring you've ever seen is above you fucking appendix
     doesn't mean anything.
Danny:
     Don't get uptight with me man. Because if you do I'll have to give you
     a dose of medicine and if I spike you you'll know you've been spoken
     to.
Withnail:
     You wouldn't spike me you're too mean. Besides, there's nothing
     invented I couldn't take.
Danny:
     If I medicined you you'd think a brain tumour was a birthday present.
Withnail:
     I could take double anything you could.
Danny [removing his sunglasses]:
     Very, very foolish words man.
I:
     He's right Withnail. Look at him . His mechanisms gone. He's had more
     drugs than you've had hot dinners.
Withnail:
     I'm not having this shag-sack insulting me. Let him get his drugs out.

[Danny gets a doll out of a bag.]

Danny:
     This doll is extremely dangerous. It has voodoo qualities.

[Withnail snorts. Danny takes the head off the doll and extracts a handful
of pills.]

Danny:
     Trade: Phenodihydrochloride benzelex. Street: The embalmer.
Withnail:
     Balls. I'll swallow it and run a mile.
Danny:
     Cool your boots man. This pill's valued at two quid.
Withnail:
     Two quid! You're out of your mind.
I:
     That's sense Withnail.
Withnail:
     You can stuff it up your arse for nothing and fuck off while you're
     doing it.
Danny:
     No need to insult me man. I was leaving anyway. Have either of you got
     shoes?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monte's house

[A battered Jag pulls up outside Monte's house and Withnail and I get out.
There is a rather flash looking open-topped Rolls parked outside. The sound
of a Schubert piano sonata comes from the house.]

Withnail:
     Monte's car.

[Withnail knocks on the door. Monte, a rather fat, effeminate, middle-aged
gentleman, opens the door. He is holding a very large fluffy cat and a
watering can.]

Monty:
     Oh hello. Come in.

[They enter and go into the lounge.]

Monty:
     Sit down do. Would you like a drink?

[They sit together on a sette.]

Withnail:
     Sherry!
Monty:
     [To withnail] Sherry. [To I] Sherry?
I:
     Sherry.
Monty:
     Sherry.

[Monty moves to the sideboard and pours the drinks. Withnail lights up yet
another cigarette.]

Monty:
     Do you like vegetables? I've always been fond of root crops but I only
started to grow last summer. I happen to think the cauliflower more
beautiful than the rose.
Withnail:
     Chin chin.

[He drinks the sherry.]

Monty:
     Do you grow?
Withnail:
     Geraniums.
Monty:
     Oh you little traitors. I think the carrot infinitely more fascinating
     than the geranium. The carrot has mystery. Flowers are essentially
     tarts. Prostitutes for the bees. There is you'll agree a certain je ne
     ses quoi oh so very special about a firm young carrot. Excuse me. Do
     help yourselves to another drink.

[Withnail turns and reaches a bottle over from the sideboard. He takes a
long swig. ]

I:
     What's all this. The man's mad.
Withnail:
     Eccentric.
I:
     Eccentric? He's insane. Not only that he's a raving homosexual.

[There is a yowl from the cat. Monte storms back into the room preceded by
the cat.]

Monty:
     You beastly little parasite. How dare you? You little thug. How dare
     you? Ooohhhh. Beastly ungrateful little swine.

[He deposits his considerable bulk on the other settee, facing the first.]

Withnail:
     Shall I get you a drink Monte?
Monty:
     Yes. Yes please dear boy. You can prepare me a small rhesus negative
     Bloody Mary. And you must tell me all the news. I haven't seen you
     since you finished your last film.

[I smiles wriley to himself. Withnail downs the drink he has prepared for
himself, pours another and starts making the Bloody Mary for Monty.]

Withnail:
     Rather busy uncle. TV and stuff. My agent's trying to edge me towards
     the Royal Shakespeare again.
Monty:
     Oh splendid.
Withnail:
     He's just had an audition for rep.
Monty:
     Oh splendid. So you're a thespian too?

[Withnail delivers Monte's drink and sits beside him.]

Withnail:
     Monte used to act.
Monty:
     I'd hardly say that. It's true I crept the boards in my youth but I
     never had it in my blood and that's what so essential isn't it?
     Theatrical zeal in the veins. Alas, I have little more that vintage
     wine and memories.

[He stands and looks at a photograph on the mantlepiece.]

Monty:
     It is the most shattering experience of a young man's life when he
     awakes and quite reasonable says to himself: [He puts his hand on his
     heart] I will never play The Dane. When that moment comes, ones
     ambition ceases. Don't you agree?
Withnail:
     A part I intend to play, Uncle.
Monty:
     And you'll be marvelous. [He starts quoting from Hamlet] We do it
     wrong, being so majestical. To offer it the show of violence......

[As Monte rambles in the background I steps over to Withnail and whispers.]

I:
     He's a madman. Any moment now he's going to rush out and get into his
     tights.
Withnail:
     Ok ok. Give me a minute.
I:
     The house or out.

[Withnail stands and moves over to Monte.]

Withnail:
     Could I have a word with you Monte?
Monty:
     Oh forgive me dear boy, forgive me. I was allowing memories to have
     the better of me.
Withnail:
     Shall I get you a top up? [He moves to the sideboard again. Monte sits
     down and reminisces.]
Monty:
     Indeed I remember my first agent. Raymond Duck. Dreadful little
     Israelite. Four floors up at the charring cross and never a job at the
     top of them. I'm told you're a writer too. Do you write poems?
I:
     No, I wish I could. It's just thoughts really.
Monty:
     Have you published?
I:
     No no.
Monty:
     Where did you school?
Withnail:
     He went to the other place Monte.
Monty:
     Oh you went to Eton?
     [The cat reappears on I's chair.]

Monty:
     Get that damned little swine out of here. It's trying to get itself in
     with you. It's trying for even more advantage. It's obsessed with its
     gut - its like a rugby ball now. It will die, it will die!
     [He storms around ineffectually.]

Withnail:
     Monte, Monte.
Monty:
     No dear boy you must leave, you must leave. Once again that oaf has
     destroyed my day.
Withnail:
     Listen Monte. Can I just have a quick word in private.
Monty:
     Oh, very well.

[Later they are leaving the house. Monty shows them to the door.]

Monty:
     Good night my dears.
Withnail:
     Good night Monty.

[Monty closes the inner door to the porch behind them.]

I:
     What's all this going off in private business? Why did you tell him I
     went to Eton?
Withnail:
     Because it wouldn't have helped if I hadn't.
I:
     What do you mean by that?
Withnail [Showing him the key to the cottage.]:
     Free to those that can afford it. Very expensive to those that can't.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The car

     [They leave Camden in I's battered old Jag. Withnail, still in his
     suit, has a bottle and is clearly drunk. They pass some schoolgirls.]

     Withnail:
          Scrubbers!
     Scrubber:
          Up yours grandad!
     Withnail:
          Scrubbers! scrubbers!
     I:
          Shut up.
     Withnail:
          Little tarts they love it.
     I:
          Listen, I'm trying to drive this thing as quietly as possible. If
          you don't shut up we'll get stopped by the police.
     [The pass a notice anouncing an accident blackspot.]

     Withnail:
          Look at that, look at that. Accident black spot. These aren't
          accidents. They're throwing themselves into the road gladly.
          Throwing themselves into the road to escape all this hideousness.
          [To a pedestrian] Throw yourselves into the road darling, you
          haven't got a chance.
     [Somewhat later they join the motorway.]

     Withnail:
          At some point or another I want to stop and get hold of a child.
     I:
          What do you want a child for?
     Withnail:
          To tutor it in the ways of righteousness and procure some
          uncontaminated urine.
     [He takes out the bottle and instructions provided by Danny.]

     Withnail:
          This is a device enabling the drunken driver to operate in
          absolute safety. You fill this with piss, take this pipe down the
          trouser and sellotape this valve to the end of the old chap. Then
          you get horrible drunk and they can't fucking touch you.
          According to these instructions, you refuse everything except a
          urine sample. You undo your valve, give them a dose of
          unadulterated child's piss and they have to give you your keys
          back. Danny's a genius. I'm going to have a doze.
          [They drive on. Later, with the light fading, they leave the
          motorway. It becomes clear that the car has only one functioning
          headlight. Still later it is totally dark and raining heavily. I
          stops and attempts to transfer the single wiper from Withnail's
          side of the car to his own but it refuses to come off. He gets
          back in the car and in shutting the door wakes Withnail, who
          looks considerably the worse for wear.]

     Withnail:
          Are we there?
     I:
          No, we're not we're here and we're in the middle of a fucking
          gale. Now you'll have to keep a look out your side. If you see
          anything tell me. Get hold of that map.
     Withnail:
          Where's the whisky?
     I:
          What for?
     Withnail:
          I've got a bastard behind the eyes. I can't take aspirins without
          a drink. Where's the aspirin?
     I:
          Probably in the bathroom.
     Withnail:
          You mean we've come out here in the middle of fucking nowhere
          without aspirins?
     I:
          Where are we?
     Withnail:
          How should i know where we are. I feel like a pig shat in my
          head.
     I:
          Now get hold of that map and look for a place called Crow Crag.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The cottage

     [They draw up in a yard and get out of the car. Withnail staggers
     around aimlessly as I gets the baggage from the boot.]

     Withnail:
          There must and shall be aspirins.
     I:
          Give me the key and get out of the way.
     Withnail:
          If I don't get aspirin I shall die here on this fucking
          mountainside.
     [They enter the house. I lights a match and finds a lantern which he
     lights. As the light comes up the inside of the cottage becomes
     visible. It is rather spartan.]

     Withnail:
          Christ almighty
     [I looks round a little more thouroughly. He notices a picture of
     Monty on the wall.]

     I:
          Monty!
     [He looks accross to Withnail who is sat dejectedly in a chair.]

     I:
          What are you doing?
     Withnail:
          Sitting down to enjoy my holiday
     I:
          Right, now we're going to have to approach this scientifically.
          First thing we've got to do is get this fire alight, then we
          split into two fact finding groups. I'll deal with the water and
          the plumbings, you check the fuel and wood situation.
     [A little later Withnail re-enters the cottage from a rather wet and
     windy night. He is holding a small stick.]

     I:
          What's that?
     Withnail:
          The fuel and wood situation. There's nothing out there except a
          hurricane. This place is uninhabitable.
     [They sit close to the fire, which is rather small.]

     I:
          Give it a chance. It's got to warm up
     Withnail:
          Warm up!? We may as well sit round a cigarette. This is
          ridiculous. We'll be found dead in here next spring.
     [He attemps half-heartedly to light a cigarette.]

     Withnail:
          I've got a blinding fucking headache. Got to have heat!
     [He stands and smashes a chair against the floor. A little later the
     fire is burning considerably higher.]

     Withnail:
          Problem's we've got to keep this bastard burning
     I:
          Well we've got enough furniture for tonight. Tomorrow we get down
          that farm and get some logs.
     Withnail:
          This is a mistake I tell you. This is a dreadful mistake.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     I's bedroom

     [I wakes the next morning and gets out of bed. He checks on Withnail
     who is still asleep. He steps outside and walks accross the yard to
     examine the view. It is quite magnificent. Later, he is dressed and
     walks down to the farm. The building is surrounded by an assortment of
     farmyard junk. He knocks at the door]

     Old woman:
          Who's there?
     I:
          Me!
     [The door opens cautiously and an old woman peers out inquiringly.]

     Old woman:
          What do you want?
     I:
          I'm a friend of Montague Withnail. He's lent us his cottage. I
          wondered if you could sell us some food. Eggs and things.
     [She looks blankly at him.]

     I:
          What about wood and coal?
     [Again, he elicits no responce. Seeing she is wearing a hearing aid,
     he bends down and talks directly to it.]

     I:
          I'm not from London you know!
     Old woman:
          I don't care where you come from.
     [She slams the door. I walks away.]

     I:
          [to himself] Not the attitude I'd been given to expect from the H
          E Bates novel I'd read. I thought they'd all be out the back
          drinking cider, discussing butter. Clearly a myth. Evidently
          country people and no more receptive to strangers than city
          dwellers.
     [He walks back to the house and addresses the door.]

     I:
          Do you think you could tell me where I could buy some coal and
          wood?
     Old woman:
          You'll have to see my son. He runs this farm.
     I:
          Where is you son?
     Old woman:
          Up in top field. You can't miss him, his legs bound in polythyne.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     The cottage

     [I walks back into the yard outside the cottage, slips, and falls in
     the mud. He picks himself up and storms inside.]

     I:
          Withnail you bastard wake up.
     [He bangs on the ceiling and moves to the sink to wash.]

     I:
          Oye, wake up you bastard you've got to get wood.
     [Withnail enters, dressed already and wrapped in a blanket.]

     Withnail:
          Jesus, you're covered in shit.
     I:
          I tried to get fuel and wood, there's a miserable little
          pensioner down there wouldn't give it me.
     Withnail:
          Where are we going to get it then?
     I:
          There's a man up on the mountain. Why he's up there, fuck knows,
          but he's up there with a leg bound in polythene, you can't miss
          him, he's your man. And have another look in that shed. Find
          anything. If you can't find anything, bring in the shed.
     [Later, they are sat down to a simple lunch.]

     I:
          How come Monty owns such a horrible little shack?
     Withnail:
          No idea.
     I:
          You never discuss your family do you?
     Withnail:
          I fail to see my family's of any interest to you. I've absolutely
          no interest in yours. I dislike relatives in general and in
          particular mine.
     I:
          Why?
     Withnail:
          I've told you why. We're incompatible. They don't like me being
          on stage.
     [He stands up and takes a foil from its bracket on the wall and
     strides up and down in actorly fashion.]

     I:
          Then they must be delighted with your career.
     Withnail:
          What do you mean?
     I:
          You rarely are.
     [Withnail points the sword menacingly, although there is a cork on the
     end.]

     Withnail:
          You just wait. Just you wait. When I strike they won't know what
          hit them.
     [He hears a noise from outside.]

     Withnail:
          Tractor approaching.
     [He goes to the window and knocks his head on the lantern hanging from
     the ceiling.]

     I:
          Then get after it. That's the man.
     [They rush out of the cottage and pursue the tractor.]

     Withnail:
          Hey, stop!
     I:
          Stop
     Withnail:
          Stop
     I:
          Stop please!
     [The tractor driver notices them and stops.]

     Withnail:
          Stop please! Please stop!
     [They run up to the side of the tractor and address the driver, Mr
     Parkin.]

     Withnail:
          Are you the farmer? [To I] Shut up, I'll deal with this. [to
          Parkin] We've gone on holiday by mistake. We're in this cottage
          here. Are you the farmer?
     I:
          Stop saying that Withnail, of course he's the fucking farmer. [To
          Parkin] We're friends of Montague Withnail, we desperately need
          fuel and wood.
     [The farmer shakes his head, bewildered.]

     I:
          Montegue Withnail, you must know him. Fat man, owns the cottage.
     Parkin:
          Ay, seen the fat man. London type. Queer sort. Think his name's
          French or something.
     Withnail:
          French!?
     Parkin:
          Ay, Adrian de la Touche. He hasn't been up year for couple of
          years. Last time I saw him, he were; he were with his son.
     I:
          Yeah, that's him.
     Withnail:
          Listen, we're bona fide. We're not from London. Could we have
          some fuel and wood?
     Parkin:
          Ay, I could bring you up some logs later but I've got the cows
          and that to feed first.
     Withnail:
          When?
     I:
          Shut up. That would be very kind of you. Erm, what about food? Do
          you think you could sell us something to eat?
     Parkin:
          I could bring you up a chicken but you'll have to go to the
          village really.
     I:
          That would be very kind of you Mr?
     Parkin:
          Parkin
     I:
          Mr Parkin. What happened to your leg?
     Parkin:
          Got a randy bull up there. Give me one in knee!
     [They walk back inside. I claps Withnail on the back. Back inside,
     Withnail removes his boots and places them in the oven attached to the
     fire.]

     I:
          You want to get out the back don't you? Get some spuds up.
     Withnail:
          Sorry I can't. My boots are in the oven
     I:
          You'd go if you had boots?
     Withnail:
          Gladly
     [Withnail emerges from the back door with polythene bags tied around
     his feet. He walks into the garden and after a little unearths a
     potato.]

     Withnail:
          I've got one!
     [Later, the potatoes are peeled and ready to be cooked. I sits reading
     'Journey's end' while Withnail dozes in front of the fire. I hears the
     tractor once again and goes out to meet Parkin. He is there with some
     logs.]

     I:
          Great. How much do we own you?
     Parkin:
          Pay us when you come down
     I:
          What about this chicken?
     Parkin:
          's on back
     [Back inside I has left the chicken on the table. It is alive and
     looks round questioningly. He nudges Withnail to wake him.]

I:
     Oye! Oye! Parkin's been. There's the supper!
Withnail:
     What are we supposed to do with that?
I:
     Eat it
Withnail:
     Eat it!? Fucker's alive
I:
     Yeah, you've got to kill it.
Withnail:
     Me!? I'm the firelighter and fuel collecter.
I:
     Yeah I know but I got the logs in. It takes away your appitite just
     looking at it.
Withnail:
     No it doesn't I'm starving. How can we make it die?
I:
     You've got to throttle them. Withnail, I think you ought to kill it
     instantly in case it starts trying to make friends with us.
Withnail:
     Alright, you get hold of ir. I'll strangle it.
I:
     I can't. Those dreadful, beady eyes! They stare you out!
Withnail:
     It's a bloody chicken. Just think of it with bacon across its back!
     Right, I'll deal with this. You'll have to get its guts out.

[Later, I is washing his hands in the sink having finished getting the
chickens guts out. Withnail enters with a shotgun and points it at I's
head.]

I:
     Never point guns at people. Extremely dangerous. Now what about this
     roasting dish? What are we going to cook it in?
Withnail:
     You're the food and plummings man. I've no idea. I wish I'd found this
     an hour ago. I'd have taken great pleasure in gunning this pullet
     down.

[He pokes the chicken with the gun. It still has a few feathers.]

Withnail:
     Shouldn't it be more bald than that?
I:
     No it shouldn't. Right, we're going to have to reverse the roles. We
     can bake the potatoes in the oven and boil this bastard over the fire.

[He tries to push the chicken into a kettle but it is too large to fit.]

Withnail:
     Lets get its feet off
I:
     No, it's going to need it's feet.

[He removes the chicken and takes it to the fire. Opening the oven, he
removes Withnail's steaming boots and points the the brick in the oven.]

I:
     Straddle them either side of that.

[He sits the chicken on the brick.]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A phonebox

[I is smoking stood outside the phonebox waiting for Withnail.]

     Withnail:
          I've already put two shilling pieces in. No I havn't got another.
          It's not my fault if the system doesn't work.
[He emerges from the phonebox.]
     Withnail:
          Bitch hung up on me.
[I fishes around in his pocket and finds a shilling for Withnail who goes
back into the phonebox and dials.]

     Withnail:
          Hello. How are you? Very well. What! Why wouldn't they see me?
          This is ridiculous. I haven't been up in a job for three months.
          Understudy Constantine!? I'm not going to understudy Constantine,
          why can't I play the part? This is ridiculous. No, I'm not in
          London, Penryth. Penryth! Well, what about TV? Listen, I pay you
          ten percent to do that. Well lick ten percent of the arses for
          me. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? How dare you! Fuck you.
[He takes out his frustration on the phone, hitting it for a while then
leaves the phonebox.]

     Withnail:
          Bastard asked me to understudy Constantine in The Seagull. I'm
          not going to understudy anyone, especially that little pimp.
          Anyway, I loath those Russian plays. Always full of women
          starring out of windows whinning about ducks going to Moscow.
[Returning from Penryth they walk accross a field. I is carrying some
shopping.]

     Withnail:
          What do you think to Desmond Wolf?
     I:
          With respect to what?
     Withnail:
          I'm thinking of changing my name.
     I:
          Too like Donald Woolfe
[He hands the bag to Withnail and opens a gate. It is clearly marked 'Shut
this gate']

     I:
          Here, changeover point.
[Withnail slams the gate behind them but it doesn't fasten. They see Parkin
on his tractor.]

     Withnail:
          Do you think he's happier than us?
     I:
          No
     Withnail:
          I suppose happiness is relative. I never thought it would be a
          polythene bag without the hole in it.
[Parkin turns the tractor towards them, stops and runs towards them.]

     I:
          What's up with him?
     Parkin:
          Shut that gate, shut that bull!
     I:
          You didn't shut the gate!
     Parkin:
          Shut that gate, shut that bull!
[A bull appears and pushes the gate open. Withnail thrusts the bag into I's
hands and vaults the wall. I is left facing the bull in a narrow corridor
between two walls.]

     Withnail:
          Grab its ring. Keep your bag up. Outvive him.
     Parkin:
          Hey, listen, show no fear! Just run at it
     I:
          Well that can't be sensible can it? The bastard's about to run at
          me
     Parkin:
          Well he's randy!
     I:
          Yeah, yeah. I know he is
[Withnail has his cigarettes out and is lighting up.]

     Withnail:
          Wants to get down there and have sex with those cows.
     I:
          Shut up Withnail!
     Parkin:
          Just run at it, shouting!
     Withnail:
          Do as he says, start shouting. It won't gore you
     I:
          A coward you are Withnail. An expert on bulls you are not!
[He shouts and throws the shopping in the air. The bull roars, I shouts
again and runs at it. It turns and retreats to its field.]

     Parkin:
          Shut that gate and keep it shut.
     Withnail:
          I think an evening at the Crow!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fields

[It is dark. The silloutes of Withnail and I appear on the skyline.]

     I [narrating]:
          If the Crow and Crown had ever had life it was dead now. It was
          like walking into a lung. A self-sustained nicotin-yellow and
          fly-blown lung. Its landlord was a retired alcoholic with
          military pretentions and a complection like the inside of a
          teapot. By the time the doors opened he was arseholed on rum and
          got progresively more arseholed until he could take no more and
          fell over at about twelve 'o' clock.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Crow and Crown

[Withnail and I are stood at the bar.]

     Withnail:
          We'll have another pair of large scotches.
[Raymond, the publican, gets the drink and takes the money for them. In
opening the till he just avoids falling over. Withnail and I suppress
laughter.]

     Raymond:
          Thought I was going for a minute but no man's put me down yet.
          Have you had any training in the martial arts?
     Withnail:
          Yes, as a matter of I have. Before I became a journalist I was in
          the terretorials.
     Raymond:
          Do you know, when you first came in here I knew you were a
          services man. You can never, never disguise it.
     Withnail:
          What were you in?
     Raymond:
          Tanks. Afrika Korps. A little before your time. Don't suppose
          you've engaged.
     Withnail:
          Ireland.
     Raymond:
          Ooooh, a crack at the Mick.
     Withnail:
          We'll have another pair of large scotches
     Raymond:
          These shall be my pleasure. What are you doing up here then?
     Withnail:
          We're doing a feature for Country Life. Survey of rural types:
          farmers, traveling tinkers, milkmen; that sort of thing.
     Raymond:
          Have you met Jake? Poacher. Works the lake but keep it under your
          hat, hmm?
[They take their drinks to a table.]

     I:
          What's all this army bollocks?
     Withnail:
          We got a drink didn't we?
[Rather later, the pair are the only remaining customers. Raymond, wiping
down the bar, is clearly leggless.]

     Raymond:
          Time please gentlemen.
     I:
          I think he means it
[The door clatters open and a man in a thick coat walks in, leans over the
bar and helps himself to a beer. I nudges Withnail. The man takes an eel
from his trousers which wriggles around violently. He strikes its head on
the bar and returns it to his trousers.]

     I:
          Ask him if we can have one
     Withnail:
          What for?
     I:
          So that we can eat it! 'We're fed up with stew'
[They approach the bar.]

     Withnail:
          Excuse me, could we have an eel? You've got eels down your leg
     Jake:
          You leave them alone. Nothing down there of interest to you.
[He removes a pheasant from under his coat.]

     Help us out Raymond. He's been stuffed from arsehole to t' beak.
     I:
          Ask him if we can have one of those. Go on.
     Withnail:
          Excuse me, we were wondering if we could purchase a pheasant off
          of you
     Jake:
          No.
     Withnail:
          Come on old boy. What's in your hump?
     Jake:
          Those pheasants are for his pot. There eels are for my pot. Now
          what makes you think I should give you something for your pot?
     Withnail:
          What pot?
     I:
          Our cooking pot.
     Jake:
          Ah, he know. Here, give us a wheeze on that fag.
[He takes the cigarette from Withnail's mouth and takes a draw. I gives him
the remains of a packet.]

     Jake:
          Might come up and see you lads in the week . Might bring you up a
          rabbit.
     Withnail:
          We don't want a rabbit, we want a pheasant.
     Jake:
          Now listen here you young prat. Haven't got no pheasants. Haven't
          got no birds. No more than you have.
     Withnail:
          Of course you have, you're the poacher.
     Jake:
          If I hear more words out of you I'll come up and set one of these
          black puddin's on you
     Withnail:
          Don't threaten me with a dead fish
     Jake:
          Half dead he might be, but I'll come up after you and wake you up
          with a live one.
     Withnail:
          Sod your pheasants. You'll have to find us first.
[They make to leave]

     Jake:
          I know where you are. You're at crow crag. I've been wathching
          you. Especially you, prancing like a tit. You want working on
          boy. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Withnail:
          if i see that sillage heap prowling around here i'll take the
          bastard axe to him. bastards. you'll all suffer. i'm going to be
          a star!
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Withnail:
          Vegtables again. I'll be sprouting feelers soon
     I:
          There's black pudding in it.
     Withnail:
          Black puddings are no good to us. I want somethings flesh!
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Withnail:
          I think I'll call myself Donald Twain. Get down, get down. It's
          him, what does he want?
     I:
          Better get down there and ask him.
     Withnail:
          Don't be ridiculous, he's got a gun. Bastard's phycotic, you've
          only got to look at him.
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Withnail:
          this place has become impossible. Nothing to eat, freezing cold
          and now a madman on the prowl outside with eels.
     I:
          alright you've made your point. we pack up tomorrow and get out.
     Withnail:
          where are you going?
     I:
          I'm going for a slash
     Withnail:
          you can't go outside, i can't get my boots on when they're hot.
     I:
          then i'll go alone
     Withnail:
          no you won't these are the sort of windows faces look in at.
     I:
          alright then i won't have a slash
     Withnail:
          and in both our interests i think we should sleep together
          tonight.
     I:
          don't be ridiculous he;s not going to come up here in the dark.
     Withnail:
          yes he is and if he catches one of us off guard he's got a much
          better chance of dealing with the other.
     I:
          no
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     I:
          ha ha ha ha ha
     Withnail:
          what are you laughing about
     I:
          i was dreaming
     Withnail:
          you frightened the piss out of me. move over
     I:
          will you get out
     Withnail:
          no
     I:
          alright, i'll have to sleep in your bed
     Withnail:
          then i'll have to come with you
     I:
          alright you can stay but the gun goes
     Withnail:
          no, i have to keep the gun . i intend to stay awake until
          morning.
     I:
          it's my bed and i demand presidence. mad fucking bastard
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     I:
          ah ah. what.
     Withnail:
          i heard a noise.
     I:
          there is nothing get to bed. what was that?
     Withnail:
          listen listen
     I:
          probably just foxes. perhaps its the farmer
     Withnail:
          at two in the morning? it's the killer. he's come to kill us.
          it's all your fault, you've even given him the fucking gun. I've
          got to get in. He's trying to get in.
     I:
          He can't, he'll go away. He's going away.
     Withnail:
          He's getting in thorough the window. He's sharpening the fucking
          knife
     I:
          where's the matches?
     Withnail:
          in the kitchen.
     I:
          alright. we'll have to tackle with him. you stay in bed and
          pretend to be asleep. when he goes for you i'll jump on his back.
     Withnail:
          no no, it'll be too late by then, i'll be knifed. we'll have to
          try and make friends with him. He's going to your room. it's you
          he wants. offer him yourself! we mean no harm.
     Monty:
          oh my boys, my boys.
     I:
          monty! monty monty!
     Withnail:
          monty you terrible cunt. what are you doing prowling round in the
          middle of the fucking night?
     Monty:
          i had a punctured tyre. i had to wait an eon for assistance. i'm
          sorry if i frightened you. i'll sleep in the other room if i may
     I:
          anywhere you like Monty
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Monty:
          ah, good morning. did you sleep well?
     I:
          mmmm. you've been busy in here
     Monty:
          as a bee. I do appologise for last night, it was perfectly
          inconsidereate of me.
     I:
          that's perfectly alright monty. how did you repair the window?
     Monty:
          didn't break it. merely forced it a little. there was an empty
          wine bottle on the ledge. tomatoes. you better wake him,
          breakfast in fifteen minutes.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Monty:
          The older order changeth giving way to the new and God forfills
          himself in many ways and soon, I suppose, I shall be swept away
          by some vulgar little tumor. My boys, we are at the end of an
          age. We live in a land of weather forcasts and breakfasts that
          set in. Shat on by Tories, shovelled up by labour. Now which of
          you is going to be a splendid fellow and go down to the Rolls for
          the rest of the wine?
     I:
          I'll go.
     Withnail:
          I'll go.
     I:
          No, I'll go - I need to see about digging the car out.
     Monty:
          But we have my car dear boy.
     I:
          Yes, but if it rains we're buggered. I mean...
     Monty:
          Stranded!
     Withnail:
          Leave this to me
     I:
          I'll come with you, I could do with a walk. Besides. I shall need
          you to work on the joint. I hear you're a little wizard in the
          kitchen.
     Withnail:
          Yeah, you the food and plumbings expert. [He starts putting his
          polythene bags on.]
     Monty:
          What on earth are those?
     Withnail:
          We forgot to bring our wellingtons.
     Monty:
          You mean you've been up here in all this beastly mud and oomska
          without wellingtons? This afternoon I'll take you both into
          Penryth and get you fitted with some good quality rubber boots.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The kitchen. [Monty has an apron on and is holding another.]
     Monty:
          I brought two of these in case either of you were any good in the
          kitchen.
     I:
          I'm not.
     Monty:
          Oh, of course you are. Cooking's one of the natural talents.
          Garlic, rosemary and salt. [He hands I a large joint of meat in a
          paper wrapper. I puts it down on the side.]
     I:
          Look this is all very kind of you Monty but I really ought to be
          out there getting some work done on the car.
     Monty:
          You haven't time we're taking late luncheon at three.
     I:
          We'll have to leave by three Monty. Didn't he tell you? We've got
          to get back to sign on.
     Monty:
          Sign on!? At a labour exchange!?
     I:
          Yes, it's rather fashionable actually. All the actors do it. Even
          Redgrave.
     Monty:
          Couldn't you forgo for just this one occasion? I've come a very
          long way to see you both.
     I:
          Sorry can't. I mean, I'd love to stay but he's more adament to
          get back than I am. [Monty slips the apron over I's head and ties
          it behind him.]
     Monty:
          Then we must choose our moment and have a word with him. I'm sure
          together we could persuade him. Now, garlic, rosemary and salt. I
          can never touch meat until it's cooked. As a youth I used to weep
          in butchers shops. [I moves through to the lounge and looks in
          the bags of food on the table.]
     I:
          I can't find the rosemary.
     Monty:
          Can't find the rosemary! I'm sure we could find it together. [He
          leans accross I in a rather comprimising fashion.]
     I:
          perhaps it's in the other bag.
     Monty:
          Perhaps it is. Shall we look? [He reaches accross with his other
          arm cutting of any opatunity of escape. Withnail enters with the
          wine and puts the bags on the table.]
     Withnail:
          Sorry. Sherry's in there. [Monty exits to the kitchen armed with
          the sherry.]
     I:
          What do you mean sorry!? What's he doing here? We can't stay he
          won't leave me alone.
     Withnail:
          Alright, we'll get the dinner down then we'll leave. [In the
          kitchen Monty pulls the cork from the sherry and emerges with
          three different glasses.]
     Monty:
          I'm afraid we must drink from these. I hope their shapes will not
          offend your palates.
     Withnail:
          Chin chin.
     Monty:
          To a delightful weekend in the country.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Penryth [Monty's car drives into Penryth and pulls up in the town
          centre. Withnail and I get out of the car. Compared to Monty and
          the car they look rather scruffy.]
     Monty:
          I do think you could at least have shaved. What will people
          think, you look like a pair of farm-hands. Get away from the car.
          [He takes out his wallet and hands Withnail two fivers.]
     Monty:
          Now, you get the wellingtons. I'm going to but some razors and
          shaving soap. I'll meet you here in half an hour. [Monty drives
          off]
     Withnail:
          Couple of blooms.
     I:
          One each. [He removes a fiver from Withnail's hand]
     Withnail:
          I think a drink don't you?
     I:
          What about the wellingtons?
     Withnail:
          Oh, bollocks to the wellingtons. We'll tell him there was a
          farmer's conference and they had a run on them.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Inside the pub [I is on the telephone while Withnail is at the
          bar.]
     I:
          yeah, ok then. yeah. promise. [He puts down the phone and walks
          over to withail]
     I:
          Hasn't heard a thing. They're still seeing people.
     Withnail:
          You don't want to go to Manchester anyway; play a bloody soilder.
     I:
          I don't know if I do. Bloody good little theatre that.
     Withnail:
          It's not much of a part is it. They'd make you cut you hair off.
     I:
          So what, you'd loose a leg! BARMAN: time please gents.
     Withnail:
          Alright we're going to have to work quickly. A pair of quadruple
          whiskies and another pair of pints please.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [Withnail and I emerge unsteadily from the pub.]
     Withnail:
          Where is he. Utterly aresholed.
     I:
          We're early. [I looks accross to some tearooms]
     I:
          We want to get in there don't we. Eat some cake. Soak up the
          booze.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [They enter the Penryth tea-rooms. I sits down at a table and
          starts buttering the bread rolls on the table. Withnail, still
          standing, points to the table and addresses an elderly waitress,
          Miss Blennerhassit.]
     Withnail:
          Alright here? Miss B: No, we're closing in a minute.
     Withnail:
          We're leaving in a minute. Alright here? Miss B: What do you
          want? [He sits down at the table and makes a rather perfunctory
          examination of the menu.]
     Withnail:
          We'll have tea and cake. [An elderly man comes across to their
          table. He is the proprietor] P: Did you hear her? She said she'd
          closed. What do you want in here?
     Withnail:
          Cake and tea. what's it got to do with you? P: I happen to be the
          proprietor. Now, will you leave?
     Withnail:
          Ah good, I'm glad you're the proprietor. I was going to have to
          have a word with you anyway. We're doing a film up here, location
          see. We might want to do a film in here. P: You're drunk.
     I:
          Just bring out the cake.
     Withnail:
          Cake and fine wine. Miss B: If you don't leave we'll call the
          police.
     Withnail:
          Balls. We want the finest wines availible to humanity. We want
          them here and we want them now. P: The police, Miss
          Blennerhassit. [ I breaks off from stuffing breadrolls but hasn't
          quite emptied his mouth at the start]
     I:
          Don't do that Miss Blenerhassit. I'm warning you Miss
          Blennerhassit, if you do - you're fired. We are
          multi-millionaries. we'll buy this place and fire you
          immediately.
     Withnail:
          Yeah, that's right, we'll buy this place and install a fucking
          duke-box and liven all you stiffs up a bit. P: The police Miss
          Blenerhassit. Just tell them there are a couple of drunks in the
          Penryth tea rooms and we'd like them removed.
     I:
          We are not drunks, we are multi-millionaires. P: Come on Mabs,
          we'll keep them here until they arrive [She starts to dial]
     Withnail:
          You won't keep us anywhere. Miss B: Police please
     Withnail:
          We'll buy this place and have it knocked down.
     I:
          It's alright, 's alright. Our car has arrived. [He pulls back a
          curtain to reveal that indeed their car has arrived, in the form
          on Monty in the Rolls. They get up and I staggers out the door]
     Withnail:
          We're coming back in here. [He tries to lean on a convenient post
          but misses and staggers a bit. He points meaningfully at the
          various customers as he leaves, shutting his coat in the door.]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The cottage [Withnail and I are sat inside. There is no sign of
          Monte. I has just finished shaving and is rubbing his face with a
          towel.]
     I:
          Where is he?
     Withnail:
          Sulking up the hill. He says he won't come down for lunch without
          an appology.
     I:
          Suits me, he can eat his fucking radish. [Unseen, Monte enters
          and addresses I]
     Monty:
          It's all you fault.
     I:
          I beg your pardon Monte.
     Monty:
          You lead him astray. Oh don't pretend you don't understand, I
          know what you're up to. [Withnail stands up and offers Monte a
          glass]
     Withnail:
          Sherry?
     Monty:
          Sherry!? Oh no, no, no, no. I'll fall straight into his trap.
          He's so mauve we don't know what he'll do next. [I walks out in
          distgust as Monte sips the sherry.]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          the kitchen [I is at the sink peeling potatoes. Monte enters]
     Monty:
          I'm preparing myself to forgive you. I think you've been punished
          enough. I think we better release you from the legume and
          transfer you talents to the meat. [he takes him by the hand into
          the lounge]
     Monty:
          You shouldn't treat each other so badly. He's been working his
          fingers to the bone and all you do is sit in here drinking. Now,
          he's going to revitalize himself in here while you finish the
          vegtables.
     Withnail:
          I don't know how to do them.
     Monty:
          Well of course you don't. You're incapable of indulging in
          anything but pleasure am I not right? [I merely smiles]
     Monty:
          You don't deserve such loyalty. Now come along, I'm going to
          teach you how to peel a potato. [He rolls up Withnail's sleeves
          and takes him unwillingly into the kitchen. Withnail swipes a
          glass of sherry off the table on the way there.]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          the dinner table [All three are sat around the table eating a
          good looking roast dinner. There is plenty of extra meat and a
          good supply of wine.]
     Monty:
          It's very stimulating getting back to a basic sort of lifestyle.
          Without effecened emotion and poisonous inhibition.
     I:
          Except the problem do tend to take the edge off it.
     Monty:
          What do you mean?
     I:
          There are no proper facilities
     Monty:
          All the glorious trials of youth dear boy. When I was a lad I'd
          rocket off on my tandem with Wrigglesworth and ride and ride.
          Find some old barn and fall asleep with the sweet perfume of hay
          on our lips.
     Withnail:
          Would it be in poor form to plagarise a toast?
     Monty:
          It depend entirely on the quality of the wine. In this case, it
          most certainly would not.
     Withnail:
          In that case, to a delightful weekend in the country.
     Monty:
          Oooh, we were expecting a volley of argument concerning Mr
          Redgrave. [I gives Withnail a look of daggers]
     I:
          You're forgetting Jake.
     Monty:
          Jake can wait too.
     I:
          Jake's not a friend Monte. I'd hoped to avoid telling you this,
          but there's a madman on the loose outside.
     Monty:
          Is this true?
     Withnail:
          Well, there's this local type. Poacher. We got into a bit of a
          tiff and he threatened me with a dead fish. Yes, it was rather
          amusing acutally. When you came into the house we thought it was
          him and we thought that you cleaning your boots was him
          sharpening the knife.
     Monty:
          Oh, how delicious!
     I:
          I'm going for a walk.
     Monty:
          Oh, wait for us dear boy, we'll all go.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Outside the cottage [I is leaning on the wall. Withnail emerges
          and walks briskly over to him]
     Withnail:
          Look, I know what your thinking but I had no alternative. The old
          beggers come a long way and I didn't want to put the wind up him.
     I:
          You sensitivity overwhelms me. If you think you're having a
          weekends indulgence up here at his expense, which means him
          having a weekends induldgence up here at my expense you've got
          another thing coming.
     Withnail:
          Anyway, he sent me out to say the coffee's ready.
     I:
          I couldn't drink it. I've got a crick in my mouth from grinning.
     Withnail:
          Well stop smilling at him.
     I:
          I can't help it, I'm so uptight with him.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The hillside. [The are walking through thick bracken listening to
          Monte expound on Oxford.]
     Monty:
          Longtemps, longtemps de teau cheveux. Oh, Bodelair. Brings back
          such memories of Oxford. I [voice over] followed by yet another
          anecdote about his sensitive crimes in a punt with a chap called
          Norman who had ref hair and a poetry book stained with the butter
          drips from crumpets.
     Monty:
          Indeed I often wonder where Norman is now. Probably wintering
          with his mother in Guilford, a cat, rain, vim under the sink and
          both bars on. But old now, there is no true beauty without decay.
     Withnail:
          Legium pro Britania
     Monty:
          How right you are, how right you are. We live in a kingdom of
          (rains/reigns) where royalty comes in gangs. Come on lads, the
          sky's bruising, night must fall and we shall be forced to camp.
     I:
          He's having my room. I want the room with the lock. Agree to that
          or I'm off.
     Withnail:
          Alright, alright [They stride off back to the cottage. Before
          they get there, they see Jake at the door. Monte looks at him
          through the binoculars]
     I:
          Good old Jake eh? And that's precisely the reason I'm off back to
          London. Come on, lets pack up and get off. Good old Jake, eh
          Withnail. Lets all have a laugh. Good old Jake.
     Monty:
          He's going away. [They walk down to the cottage. There is a hare
          tied to the door with a note attached. Withnail unfolds the note
          and hands it to Monte. Monty clearly has some difficulty in
          reading the note.]
     Monty:
          Here hare here. [The meaning dawns on him.]
     Monty:
          Here hare here!
     Withnail:
          Good old Jake.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The cottage. [They are playing poker with bottle tops and a few
          coins. An old gramaphone is plaing in the background. The game is
          stud with two down cards - Monty has the ace of spades and two
          small spades showing, I just queen high]
     Monty:
          Ace bets two and it's over to you.
     Withnail:
          You two and up two.
     I:
          So that's four?
     Monty:
          That's four. [I puts in four. Monty deals the last set of cards.]
     Monty:
          ?
     Withnail:
          Denai surenum defit. [He deals I another queen to I]
     Monty:
          Oh, there she is. [He deals himself another spade]
     Monty:
          A possible flush. Well, it's the two queens to bet!
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [Still at the table, Monty winds up the gramaphone.]
     Monty:
          Another hand? [Withnail looks up and slumps in his chair. He is
          totally plastered.]
     Monty:
          I think we'd better get him to bed.
     I:
          No, he's down here. You're in my room, I'm in his room and he's
          down here.
     Monty:
          I wouldn't dream of depriving the poor fellow of his bed.
          Particularlly in that condition.
     I:
          It's what he wants!
     Withnail:
          No I don't I want to get to bed!
     I:
          Come on then luvy, lets get you to bed then. A good nights sleep
          will do us both some good. [He grabs Withnail under the arms and
          manouvers him out of the room.]
     I:
          We'll I'll say good night then Monty.
     Withnail:
          I want to be alone. [I staggers up the stairs with Withnail who
          mumers about wanting to be on his own. He drops him on the bed
          and dashes back to his own room to get his bedding. Before he can
          get back though Monty has come up the stairs and just finished
          locking the door.]
     Monty:
          He doesn't want to sleep with you.
     I:
          Right then, You're in there and I'll take the couch. I'll say
          night night then Monty.
     Monty:
          You already have. Twice!
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [Downstairs I frantically aranges the blankets on the settee.
          Monty enters]
     I:
          What is it Monty, I'm terribly tired I need to get to bed.
     Monty:
          But not that tired eh? Are you a sponge or a stone?
     I:
          I beg you pardon Monty?
     Monty:
          Do you like to sample all facets of life or do you shut yourself
          off from new experience.
     I:
          I voted conserative
     Monty:
          Loyalty isn't a matter of selection.
     I:
          I quite agree, it's more a matter of chosing to whom one is
          loyal. I'm terribly tired Monty, I need to get to bed.
     Monty:
          You must mustn't you. Off you go then. I'll sleep down here. It
          won't be the first time I've been left with the couch!
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          [I is in bed. He has barricaded the door by propping a chair
          against the knob. There is a determined pushing at the door from
          the other side which dislodges the chair and Monty enters.]
     Monty:
          Boy! Boy! I know you're not asleep boy. But he is. I've been into
          his room. He won't hear a thing.
     I:
          No I'm not asleep. What is it Monty, what do you want. [I lights
          a candle. Monty sits down on the side on the bed.]
     Monty:
          I tried not to come, oh how I tried not to.
     I:
          There's something I've got to tell you Monty.
     Monty:
          There's no need to explain, he's told me everything.
     I:
          What! What's he told you?
     Monty:
          About how you came to Chelsea and you arrest in the totenham
          court road. He told me about your probelms, how you feel.
     I:
          Probelms, what problems?
     Monty:
          You are a toilet trader! Go with it boy, give into to it. It's
          like a tide. Don't let it ruin your youth as I nearly did over
          Eric.
     I:
          I'm not homosexual Monty
     Monty:
          Yes you are! Of course you are. You're only saying that to deny
          your relationship with him. It's not his fault that he can't love
          you any more that it's mine that I adore you. Can't we allow
          ourselves this one moment of indiscretion? He need never know.
     I:
          I don't care what he knows, you must leave Monty. [I gets out of
          bed and goes over to the door. Monty beats him to it.]
     Monty:
          I mean to have you even if it must be burgulary. [I races to the
          other side of the room. Monty advances.]
     I:
          Monty you must listen! We're in an affair, we have been for
          years. But he's estranged, he won't allow himself to admit it.
          That's why he's rejecting me while you're here. On my life Monty,
          this is the first time in six years we havn't slept together. I
          couldn't cheat on him, it would kill him.
     Monty:
          Oh my dear boy, if I'd realised that I'd never have attempted to
          come between you.
     I:
          I know that Monty, I respected you for your sensitivity, I thank
          you for it.
     Monty:
          You better go to him
     I:
          Oh, I intend to. This instant.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Withnail's room [Withnail is asleep in bed with the shotgun. I
          enters]
     I:
          Withnail you bastard wake up. Wake up you bastard before I burn
          this bastard bed down.
     Withnail:
          I deny all accusations. What do you want?
     I:
          I've just narrowly avoided having a buggery. And I've come in
          here with the express intention of wishing one on you. That said,
          I'm leaving for London.
     Withnail:
          Hold on, hold on. Don't let you imagination run away with you.
          [He light up and coughs up some phlem]
     I:
          I've just finished fighting a naked man. How dare you tell him
          I'm a toilet trader!
     Withnail:
          Tatical necessity. If I hadn't told him you were active we'd
          never have got the cottage.
     I:
          I wouldn't have wanted it, not with him in it.
     Withnail:
          I never thought he'd come all this way.
     I:
          Monty!? He'd go to New York.
     Withnail:
          Calcualted risk.
     I:
          What is all this calculated risk and tactical necessity. It's me,
          naked, in a corner. And how dare you tell him I love you? And how
          dare you tell him you rejected me? How dare you tell him that!?
     Withnail:
          Sorry about that, got a bit carried away. Sort of said it without
          thinking. [I takes the gun]
     I:
          Well let me tell you something Withnail, if he comes in my room
          again its murder and you'll be held resposible in law.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The cottage [Withnail is eating lunch at the table. I is reading
          a note]
     I:
          'Perhaps it is just that the evesdropper should leave as his
          trade dictates, in secrecy and in the dead of night. I do
          sincerely hope that you will find the happiness that has saddly
          always been denied me. Yours faithfully, Montegue H Withnail.'
          Poor old bastard.
     Withnail:
          Now I must say, that represents a level of hippocrasy in you that
          I'd previously suspected but not noticed due to highly evasive
          skills.
     I:
          You'll suffer for this Withnail. What you have done will have to
          be paid for.
     Withnail:
          I'll say one thing for Monte; he keeps a sensational cellar.
          [There is a knock at the door.]
     I:
          Who is it. VOICE: Telegram. [I gets the telegram and opens it. He
          shows it to Withnail]
     Withnail:
          Well done.
     I:
          Well it doesn't mean to say I've got the part. They probably just
          want to see me again. Well, that settles it, we leave
          immediately.
     Withnail:
          What!?
     I:
          Get you stuff together, we leave in half an hour.
     Withnail:
          Don't be ridiculous, I need at least an hour for lunch.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The car [Withnail is eating the lunch from a plate on his knee.
          It is raining heavinly and I's side of the windscreen is
          impossible to see through]
     Withnail:
          You got a truck coming up in this lane followed by a slow
          right-hander.
     I:
          This is insanity
     Withnail:
          Stay in this lane
     I:
          What lane, I can't see any lane.
     Withnail:
          Bear right, bear right.
     I:
          I can't keep this up. And I must get some sleep.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The car [It is daytime again, and the rain has stopped.I is
          asleep in the back on the car. The car jerks around and he woken.
          As he looks out the window, the camera moves with his view. The
          car is hurtling down the motorway swerving between the other
          cars.]
     I:
          What's going on?
     Withnail:
          I'm making time.
     I:
          Pull over, you haven't got a license.
     Withnail:
          No, I'm making time. Here comes another fucker. [They swerve
          infront of several more cars. Then I sees a police van behind
          them.]
     I:
          On no.
     Withnail:
          It's perfectly alright, leave him to me.
     I:
          You're full of scotch you silly tool. [The police van comes along
          side them and a policeman leans out pointing markedly to the
          roadside. Withnail pulls over, the van draws up in front on them
          and the officers approach the car. One knocks on the window and
          Withnail winds it down.] P1: Bit early in the morning for
          festivities isn't it sir? [There is a large pile of bottles on
          the passenger seat of the car]
     Withnail:
          They're not mine, they belong to him. P1: You're drunk.
     Withnail:
          I assure you I'm not officer, I've only had a few ales. P1: Out
          of the car. Please. Sir. [Withnail makes no move so he opens the
          door. Withnail virtually falls out then stands against the car.
          The policeman offers him a breathaliser] P1: Would you fill this
          bag please sir. [Withnail shakes his head] P1: Are you refusing
          to fill this bag?
     Withnail:
          I most certainly am P1: I'm placing you under arrest.
     Withnail:
          Don't be ridiculous I haven't done anything. Listen, my cousin's
          a QC. P2: Get in the back on the van.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Police station [Withnail is behind a screen. A sergant is sat at
          a desk while other policemen wonder around] P3: Serg, what's that
          clown up to? [The sergent pulls a gap in the screen and sees
          withnail with the contraption Danny gave him. He grabs the tube
          and urine splashes everywhere. Withnail grins sheepishly]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The flat [Withnail and I enter their flat. They look through the
          post]
     Withnail:
          Where's our checks?
     I:
          We didn't sign on.
     Withnail:
          That wouldn't make any difference to last weeks payments. [They
          hear music from upstairs. The door to the bathroom is ajar and in
          the bath is a large black man who looks at them inquiringly. I
          looks in his bedroom. The bed is occupied by Danny]
     I:
          What are you doing in my bed? D: Having a sleep.
     I:
          Who's the huge spade in the bath? D: Presuming Ed.
     I:
          Well I want you out. You've got ten minutes alright? Coz I want
          to get in.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The lounge [All four are sat in the lounge]
     Withnail:
          How did you get in? D: Inginuity man - come up the drainpipe.
          Would you like a smoke?
     Withnail:
          Yes
     I:
          No thanks, I've got a call to make. [Danny starts pulling out
          rizzlers at a prolific rate]
     Withnail:
          What are you going to do with those? D: The joint I am about to
          roll requires a craftsman and can utalise up to twelve spliffs.
          It is called a Camberwell carrot.
     I:
          It's imposible to use 12 papers on one joint. D: It is impossible
          to roll a camberwell carrot with anything less.
     Withnail:
          Who says it's a Camberwell carrot. D: I do. I invented it in
          Camberwell and it's shaped like a carrot. [Cut to Danny on the
          settee. The Camberwell carrot is complete and is indeed of
          prodidiuos proportions. As Danny lights it we see only the end
          but as he hands it to withnail we see the true size. It is
          enormous.] D: These will tend to make you very high. [Withnail
          takes a long draw] D: This grass is the most powerfull in the
          western hemisphere. It grows at exactly two thousand feet above
          sea-level. I have it special flown in from my man in Mexico. His
          name's Huang. He's an expert. [I returns from his phone call] D:
          Did you get the part man? [I takes a draw on the joint and
          splutters. He shakes his head]
     I:
          No, I got a different one. They want me to play the lead.
     Withnail:
          Congratulations. D: Where exactly have you two been?
     I:
          A trip to the countryside. D: That is a very good idea. London is
          a city coming down from its trip and there's going to be a lot of
          refugees. [Presuming Ed laughs deeply] D: Did you realise this
          gafs overrun with rodents? When I came in I saw one in the oven
          the size of a fucking dog.
     I:
          That is a dog, belongs to the man downstairs. D: Does his dog get
          in the oven.
     Withnail:
          No his dog doesn't come up here. D: Then it was a rodent. Quite
          freeked me at the time. I was going to cook onions. There was
          some bald gieser round here the other day reckoned you owed him
          235 quid backrent. I told him there was no question of paying
          rent on a property infested with rodent. Started coming on all
          bald with me.
     Withnail:
          You mean ratty. D: I told him to piss off.
     I:
          You bloody fool. He'll have us up in court again. D: No he won't,
          it's not legal.
     Withnail:
          We can quote you on that I presume. D: Law rather appeals to me
          actually. [Withnail laughs uncontrolably and drops to the floor]
          D: Just high.
     I:
          Stop laughing will you Withnail, this is serious. D: No it ain't.
          I looked into it. Studied the papers.
     I:
          What papers? D: Legal papers. [He shakes the papers out of a bag]
     I:
          Look, he's got our checks. What are you doing with these? D: I
          was going to pay them in for you.
     I:
          For christ'd sake Withnail, stop laughing will you. Look, this is
          a notice of eviction
     Withnail:
          Give it to my barrister. [Presuming Ed starts chanting and
          rotating a globe] Ed: Harriramma, Hariramma
     I:
          Shup up will you, you're giving me the fear! Give us a downer
          Danny, I've gone and fucked my brain. D: Sit down man, take
          control. You have a rush. It will pass.
     I:
          Aren't you getting absurdly high? D: Precisely the reason I'm
          smoking it.
     Withnail:
          I couldn't I'm spaced. D: Not as spaced as you rodents.
     I:
          Don't talk about them. D: I expect they're talking to each other.
     I:
          Talking to each other? What do you mean? D: I've dealt with them.
          Given 'em all drugged onion.
     I:
          Why've you drugged their onions!? D: Sit down man, find your
          neutral space. You have done something to your brain. You have
          made it high. If I lay 10 mills of diazipan on you, you will do
          something else to your brain, you will make it low. Why trust one
          drug rather than the other. That politics ain't it.
     I:
          I'm going to eat some sugar. D: I recommend you smoke some more
          grass.
     I:
          No way, no fucking way. D: That is an unfortunate political
          decission.
     Withnail:
          What are you talking about Danny? D: If you are holding onto a
          rising balloon you are presented with a difficult political
          decission - let go while you've still got the chance or hold onto
          the rope and continue getting higher. That's politics man. We are
          at the end of an age. The greatest decade in the history of
          mankind is nearly over. They're selling hippy wigs in wolworths.
          It is 91 days to the end of the decade and as presuming ed here
          has so consistently pointed out, we have failed to paint it
          black.
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     I:
          Right, I'm off now.
     Withnail:
          Already?
     I:
          My father will pick up my stuff in the week and do something
          about the car.
     Withnail:
          But I've got us a bottle open. Confiscated it from Monte's
          supplies. 53 Margaux. Best of the century
     I:
          I can't Withnail, I'll miss the train.
     Withnail:
          There's always time for a drink.
     I:
          I haven't the time.
     Withnail:
          Alright, I'll walk with you to the station. We can drink it
          through the park. [He grabs his coat and an umbrella and takes
          the bottle.]
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          The Park [It is pouring down with rain. Withnail offer the bottle
          to I]
     I:
          No thankyou, no more. Look, it's a stinker Withnail, why don't
          you go home.
     Withnail:
          Because I want to walk you to the station.
     I:
          No, really, I really don't want you to. [They stop by the
          wolves.]
     I:
          I shall miss you Withnail.
     Withnail:
          I'll miss you too. [I departs. Withnail walks to the fence and
          leans against it.]
     Withnail:
          I have of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth and
          indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly
          frame the earth seems to me a sterile promotory; this most
          excellent canopy the air, look you, this mighty o'rehanging
          firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire; why, it
          appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of
          vapours. What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how
          infinite in faculties, how like an angel in aprehension, how like
          a God! The beauty of the world, paragon of animals; and yet to
          me, what is this quintessence of dusk. Man delights not me, no,
          nor women neither, nor women neither. [The wolves are
          unimpressed. Withnail exits into the rain.]

        Over jungle sound effects, the CAMERA is low, moving
        through brush from the POV of a stalking animal. As the
        brush parts, revealing Wall Street and the New York Stock
        Exchange, we HEAR the resonant voice of GENE HACKMAN.

2       INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY   (FEB `95)          2

        Absolute bedlam. 300 drunken STOCKBROKERS, most in their

       The Brokers go apeshit as Jordan grabs the Dwarf by his
       pants and collar. In the Crowd, cash flies as side bets
       are made. Jordan winds up, aims for the "dartboard".

       A CHERRY RED Ferrari Testarossa ZOOMS down the L.I.E.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  --which really pissed me off
                  because it was three shy of a
                  million a week.

       The Ferrari weaves in and out of traffic.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Hey, my Ferrari was white, like
                  Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.

       We see the same Ferrari, now in WHITE, as it zooms away,
       a BLONDE head bobbing up and down in Jordan's lap.

       We see NAOMI, 24, blonde and gorgeous, a living wet dream
       in LaPerla lingerie.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  My wife, Naomi, the Duchess of Bay
                  Ridge, Brooklyn, a former model
                  and Miller Lite girl.

       Naomi licks her lips; she's incredibly, painfully hot.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Yeah, she was the one blowing me
                  in the Ferrari, so put your dick

8      INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT (FEB `95)                                8

       Sweaty, wild-eyed and naked, Jordan fucks an HISPANIC
       HOOKER from behind.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  I also gamble like a degenerate,
                  drink like a fish, fuck hookers
                  maybe five times a week and have
                  three different Federal agencies
                  looking to indict me.

       He dismounts, snorts some coke through a straw, then uses
       it to blow some into her asshole.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Oh yeah, and I love drugs.

     Jordan looks up suddenly, paranoid, as if he's hearing
     voices.


9    INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT     (FEB `95)                             9

     Jordan, drooling and stoned out of his skull, wears a
     rumpled custom-made business suit as he mans a set of
     controls next to his frantic co-pilot, CAPTAIN DAVE.

                               CAPTAIN DAVE
                Pull up!   Jesus! We're gonna
                crash!!

     Jordan's head bobs as he pulls back on the stick.
     The helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering
     30 feet above a huge mansion. Down below, through
     Jordan's hazy, DOUBLE VISIONED POV, we see a sparkling
     pool, tennis court and waterfall.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Check this out -- despite my
                completely fucked-up state, I
                could fly straight while still
                seeing two of everything.

     He closes one eye; his POV sharpens. Putting pressure on
     the stick, the helicopter descends slowly over the
     driving range... then LURCHES and SLAMS to the ground.

                              JORDAN
                     (to Captain Dave)
                Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay,

10   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - FRONT DOOR - DAY      (FEB `95)            10

     Morning. Sober now, impeccable in suit and tie, Jordan
     heads for the door holding a glass of orange juice.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Yes, on a daily basis I take
                enough drugs to sedate greater

     He pops two white pills, swigs some juice, then speaks
     directly to the camera as he heads for a waiting limo.

12   EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - LONG ISLAND - DAY     (FEB `95)    12

     The limo pulls up to the black glass office building.
     Jordan gets out, heads inside through a back door.

                              JORDAN
                But of all the drugs under God's
                blue heaven, there's one that's my
                absolute favorite.


13   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY (FEB `95)    13

     Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. With
     the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses
     a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk. As he
     peels a crisp $100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad, rolls it up:

                              JORDAN
                Enough of this shit'll make you
                invincible, able to conquer the
                world and eviscerate your enemies.

     He SNARFS up the line, gestures to the cocaine.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                I'm not talking about this. I'm
                talking about this.
                     (Jordan unfurls the
                      $100 with a SNAP)
                Money is the oxygen of capitalism
                and I wanna breathe more than any
                other human being alive.

     He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner,
     where it comes to rest with two dozen others. Over his
     back as we TRACK HIM out of his office toward what sounds
     like the ROAR of a mob--

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Money doesn't just buy you a
                better life -- better food, better
                cars, better pussy -- it also
                makes you a better person. You
                can give generously to the church
                of your choice or the political
                party. You can save the fucking
                spotted owl with money.

14    INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY         (FEB `95)        14

      Arms akimbo, Jordan stands above the bullpen, a huge open
      space with tightly packed rows of maple colored desks.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 But most of all, in any country in

      His 300 BROKERS, mostly young men with their jackets off,
      scream wildly. They worship him.

                 With that in mind, at the tender
                 age of 22, after marrying my

19    EXT. WALL STREET - DAY      (MAY `87)                              19

      An express bus pull up -- its sign reads "Wall
      Street"....

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 --I headed to the only place that
                 befit my high-minded ambitions...

      Jordan emerges, kisses TERESA goodbye, then joins a sea
      of Commuters heading to work.

20    INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY       (MAY `87)               20

      Computers, telephones everywhere. At their desks, 45
      shirt-sleeved BROKERS read their Wall St. Journals,
      readying for war. Like an eager puppy, Jordan follows
      broker JERRY FOGEL, 30, thick-lipped and bow-tied...

                         JERRY FOGEL
           Your job is `connector', which
           means you'll be dialing the phone
           over 500 times a day, trying to
           `connect' me with business owners.
           And till you pass your Series 7,
           that's all you'll be doing. Sit.

Jordan takes a seat at the desk next to Fogel's.

                         JERRY FOGEL (CONT'D)
           Just so you know, last year I made
           over 300k and the other guy you'll
           be working for made a million.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           A million dollars? I could only
           imagine what a douchebag that guy
           must be.

A manicured hand lands on Jordan's shoulder. It's MARK
HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.

                          MARK HANNA
           Jordan? Mark Hanna.
                (re: Fogel)
           Good, you've met Jerry. One of
           the smartest guys in the office.
           Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out
           of loneliness.

Fogel's smile turns to a frown.      He hands Jordan a stack
of 3x5 index cards.

                         JERRY FOGEL
           Smile and dial. And don't pick
           your fucking head up till one.

                         MARK HANNA
           Don't mind Jerry, his father raped
           him as a child. Besides, I'm
           senior broker here, he's a
           worthless piker. I heard you
           pitched stock at your job
           interview.

                         JORDAN
           Had to do something to stand out.

                         MARK HANNA
           I fuckin' love that! Let's grab
           lunch later. Windows good with

Hanna gives him a wink, looks at the clock on the giant
electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.

           Let's fuck!!

RING!!! Absolute pandemonium at the BELL signalling the
opening of the stock market. Feet fly off desks; Brokers
and their Connectors dial phones like mad. The CAMERA
PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR.

           Wall Street. Fuck this, shit
           that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I
           couldn't believe how these guys
           talked to each other--

Fogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen.        He covers his
mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.

                         JERRY FOGEL
           Dial the cocksucking phone!

Jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           I was hooked within seconds.

Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a
"buy" ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder
which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           It was like mainlining adrenaline.

The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and we're suddenly--

     CLOSE ON a COKE SPOON whose contents disappear up a
     nostril. PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

     The lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the
     city. At a corner table, a paranoid Jordan looks around
     as Hanna does another bump of coke. None of the other
     DINERS seem to notice or care.

                              MARK HANNA
                     (offering the spoon)
                Got enough for one more? Tootski?

                               JORDAN
                No.   Thanks though.

     Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the
     tuxedoed Maitre'D, approaches.

                              HECTOR
                Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for
                you on this glorious afternoon?

     Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan
     notices.

                              MARK HANNA
                Here's the game plan, Hector.
                Bring us two Absolut Martinis
                straight up. Precisely seven and
                a half minutes after you deliver
                those you'll bring two more, then
                two more every five minutes until
                one of us passes out.

                              HECTOR
                An excellent strategy, sir.

                              JORDAN
                Actually, I'm good with 7-Up.

     Jordan might as well have farted at the table.

                               MARK HANNA
                First day on Wall Street, Hector.
                Give him time.
                     (Hector offers menus)
                No thanks, I'm not eating.

     Hector heads off.

                              JORDAN
                You can get high during the day
                and still function?
                                                         10.
 The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         MARK HANNA
           High is the only way to do this
           fucking job. Guy who coined the
           term "three-martini lunch" was a
           woman. Cocaine and hookers, my
           friend, the keys to success.

Jordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding.

                          JORDAN
           I gotta say, I'm really excited
           about being part of your team.
           I wanna do all I can for our
           clients and --

                         MARK HANNA
                (reciting an ad)
           "Here at L.F. Rothschild, our
           clients aren't just important,
           they're family." Just as long as
           we get our taste first. Remember
           something, Jordan, your top
           priority in this job: make us
           money. If the clients get rich
           along the way, bully for them.
           Got a girlfriend?

                          JORDAN
           Wife.   She cuts hair.

Mark swallows a comment about that.      Gets to business.

                         MARK HANNA
           OK, first rule of Wall Street.
           Nobody -- and I don't care if
           you're Warren Buffet or Jimmy
           Buffet -- nobody knows if a
           stock's going up, down or fucking
           sideways, least of all stock
           brokers. But we have to pretend
           we know. Make sure you stay
           relaxed. Nobody wants to buy
           something from someone who sounds
           like they haven't gotten laid in a
           month. Take breaks when you feel
           stressed, jerk off if you can.
           You like jerking off, right?

                           JORDAN
           Well... sure.

                         MARK HANNA
           Good, jerking off is key. And I
           highly recommend cocaine, which
           will make you dial faster, which
           is good for me. Churn `em and
           burn `em, baby.
                                                              11.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

     A BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks
     him. Then, discreetly as possible, Mark removes a fresh
     vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort.
     Jordan realizes: that's why he palmed the maitre d' $100.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                For the next six months I learned
                the ways of Wall Street.


22   INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT    (OCT `87)                           22

     As STRIPPERS grind in b.g, Jordan parties with Mark Hanna
     and dozens of BROKERS and TRAINEES. Jordan sips a
     martini and studies Mark Hanna, hitting on a STRIPPER.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                That fall I passed my Series 7.
                Finally it was here.


23   INT. ROTHSCHILD BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY      (OCT `87)          23

     Briefcase in hand, Jordan boards the elevator with a
     dozen other BROKERS.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                My first day as a stockbroker, a
                future Master of the Universe.

     And as the doors close, on screen WE SEE:

                        OCTOBER 19th, 1987


24   INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY      (OCT `87)            24

     Total chaos. Jordan dials the phone as all around him
     Brokers panic, screaming into headsets.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                They called it Black Monday.
                By four p.m. the market was down
                508 points, the biggest one-day
                drop since the crash of `29.

     4 p.m. The closing bell RINGS; the entire place goes
     silent. Brokers look at each other, stunned.

                               MARK HANNA
                Holy.   Fucking. Shit.

     And as the Brokers start commiserating with each other...
                                                                12.
      The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                L.F. Rothschild, a company that
                had been in business since 1883,
                closed its doors within a month.


25   INT. JORDAN & TERESA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (DEC `87)       25

     Jordan sits at the table perusing the Times classifieds.
     Teresa approaches with two coffees. Sits next to him.

                              TERESA
                So I'll take an extra shift, don't
                worry about it.

                              JORDAN
                You work too much as it is.

                              TERESA
                We could pawn my engagement ring.

                              JORDAN
                We're not pawning anything. I'm
                gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.

                              TERESA
                You know that doesn't matter,
                right?

     He smiles, kisses her.     Together, they peruse the ads.

                              JORDAN
                     (points to an ad)
                "Nobody Beats the Wiz".      I could
                be a stock boy.

                              TERESA
                You're a stock broker.

                              JORDAN
                No one's hiring brokers right now,
                sweetie.

     They go back to the ads.     After a few beats, she points--

                                 TERESA
                This place is.


26   EXT. STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - LONG ISLAND - DAY (DEC `87)      26

     In a suit, Jordan emerges from an `85 Datsun. He looks
     around confused, heads toward an unmarked storefront.
                                                              13.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

27   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - DAY     (DEC `87)                     27

     The antithesis of L.F. Rothschild, with cheap furniture
     and a dozen misfit "BROKERS" giving loud, obnoxious sales
     pitches. Jordan enters, a modern man among cave people.
     DWAYNE, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.

                              JORDAN
                I'm looking for Investor's Center?

                              DWAYNE
                That's us, hey. Dwayne.

                              JORDAN
                     (as they shake hands)
                Jordan Belfort, I called earlier.
                I was a broker with Rothschild.

     Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat. Nearby, a Broker in
     ratty Keds, TOBY WELCH, is screaming into his phone.

                              TOBY WELCH
                I'm tellin' you, this stock is
                goin' up!... Cause I know,
                okay?!... I have inside
                information!

     Jordan looks at him, appalled at what he's hearing.

                              JORDAN
                Where are your quotrons?

                              DWAYNE
                No quotrons, we sell off the pink
                sheets -- penny stocks.

     Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are
     literally pink. He explains as Jordan flips the pages:

                              DWAYNE (CONT'D)
                Company don't have enough capital
                to be listed on NASDAQ, their
                shares trade here.
                     (points to the book)
                Like these guys, Aerotyne? They
                make radar detectors out of a
                garage in Dubuque.

                              JORDAN
                Six cents a share? Who buys this
                crap?

                              DWAYNE
                Schmucks mostly. Mailmen,
                plumbers, people thinking they can
                get rich quick. They answer our
                ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.
                                                                 14.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

                              JORDAN
                The spread on these is huge.

                              DWAYNE
                So's your commission, that's the
                point. Blue chips stocks you get
                what, one percent? Pink sheets
                are fifty.

                              JORDAN
                Wait a second. You're telling me
                if I sell two thousand dollars
                worth of stock, my commission is a
                thousand bucks?

                              DWAYNE
                Technically, yeah, but not even
                the biggest schmuck buys two
                thousand dollars of this shit.


28   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY       (DEC '87)         28

     As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone
     cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then:

                              JORDAN
                     (into phone)
                Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan
                Belfort with Investor's Center in
                New York City. You recently
                responded to one of our ads...

     A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                The reason I'm calling is that
                an extremely exciting investment
                opportunity crossed my desk today.
                Typically our firm recommends no
                more than five stocks per year:
                this is one of them...

     A few more Brokers look over...

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                Aerotyne International is a
                cutting edge tech firm out of the
                Midwest, awaiting imminent patent
                approval on a new generation of
                radar equipment...

     LATER.   Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention.
                                                              15.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                -- so if Aerotyne's shares rise
                to only a dollar -- and our
                research indicates they could go
                much, much higher -- your profit
                on a mere three thousand dollar
                investment would be upwards of
                fifty thousand... That's right,
                you could pay off your mortgage.

     Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                Four thousand dollars, will
                that be check or money order?...
                Thank you, sir.

     Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a "buy" ticket.

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Just like that I made two grand.
                The other guys looked at me like
                I'd just discovered fire.

     Toby Welch and the other cave-Brokers stare at him.

                              TOBY WELCH
                How'd you fuckin' do that?


29   INT. INVESTOR'S CENTER - (ANOTHER) DAY (FEB `88)               29

     Jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused.

                              JORDAN
                It's a rock-solid company, sir,
                it's the next Microsoft...
                Six thousand. Terrific.

     As Jordan continues talking, wrapping up the sale...

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Though I knew I was selling
                garbage, within twelve weeks I
                was making a fortune.

     And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                And as a wise man once told me,
                my only responsibility was to
                put meat on the table.

     CLOSE ON a 1988 Jaguar, parked outside a diner...
                                                                 16.

30    INT. KACANDES DINER - BAYSIDE - DAY        (JUN `88)                 30

      Wearing a suit, Jordan sits in a booth reading the Wall
      Street Journal as a WAITRESS serves the food. DONNIE
      AZOFF, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright
      white teeth approaches from the takeout counter.

                               DONNIE
                 That your Jag in the lot?

                                   JORDAN
                 Yeah.

                                   DONNIE
                 Nice ride.      Donnie Azoff.

                               JORDAN
                 Jordan Belfort.

                               DONNIE

                 the same building. Twelfth floor?
                      (Jordan nods)
                 What do you do, bro?

                               DONNIE
                 Kids furniture, me and my brother-
                 in-law. Making any money?

                               JORDAN
                 Seventy grand last month.

                               DONNIE
                 Get the fuck out. You made
                 seventy grand in one month.

                               JORDAN
                 Seventy two actually.

      Donnie studies him, isn't sure if he's full of shit.

                               DONNIE
                 Tell you what. You show me a pay
                 stub with $72,000 on it, I'm
                 quitting my job right now and
                 coming to work with you.

     Jordan watches as Donnie crosses to a pay phone and
     dials.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                And he did quit his job, which
                I thought was a little weird.
                I mean I had just met this
                fucking guy.

     A few beats, then into phone:

                              DONNIE
                Yo Paulie, it's Donnie...     Yeah,
                listen, I quit.

     Jordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation...

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                There were other things about him
                too, like his phosphorescent white
                teeth and the fact that he wore
                horn rims with clear lenses to
                look more Waspy. He also married
                his first cousin --

     Jordan sits in mid-conversation with Donnie over beers.

                              DONNIE
                No problem, if we have a kid who's
                a retard, we'll just leave it on
                the steps of some institution.

     And as they continue drinking...

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                He was also a closet drug fiend.
                I'd known him less than a week
                before he talked me into smoking
                crack.

     Jordan and Donnie get high. Donnie holds a flame under a
     crack pipe.
                                                                 18.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                The weird thing was when he'd do
                crack, his face would contort into
                this bizarre, frozen mask like the
                Phantom of the Opera.

     Donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his
     facial muscles contort, locking up like a stroke victim.
     After a few beats, he hands the pipe to Jordan.

                              DONNIE
                You now, take a hit!

     Jordan takes a deep hit and holds it.      A beat, then:

                              JORDAN
                Omigod, I fuckin' love you!!

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                I knew I had to make him my
                partner.

     Jordan looks on as Donnie works the phone like a madman.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Which turned out to be a great
                move - Donnie was a fast learner
                who transitioned into the penny
                stock business quickly.

     Jordan and Donnie pull up to a defunct auto body shop,
     which has a "For Lease" sign in the window.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                So within months we started our

                body shop.

                In addition to Donnie, I also

                              SEA OTTER
                He only wanted to make furniture.

                              CHESTER MING
                What's that got to do with
                anything?

                              SEA OTTER
                He just said everyone wants to
                get rich.

                              ROBBIE FEINBERG
                     (to Jordan)
                That's true, you did.

     Toby) make sales calls from the cheap desks.

40   EXT. MARINA - LONG ISLAND - SUNSET        (MAY `89)              40

     On lounge chairs at the edge of a dock, bottle of wine
     nearby, Jordan sits with Teresa. He smiles as she opens
     a jewelry case -- inside is a diamond tennis bracelet.

                               TERESA
                Omigod.   Jordan.

                                  JORDAN

                              TERESA
                It's beautiful.

     Jordan helps her try it on.       She smiles, but he detects a
     wave of... something.

                              JORDAN
                They're small, I know, but the
                stones are really high quality.

                               TERESA
                No, no.   I love it.

                                  JORDAN
                Then what?

     They sit in silence.       Finally:

                              TERESA
                I don't know, it's just -- these
                stocks, these crappy companies.

                               JORDAN
                 It's not illegal, Teresa,
                 technically. I mean they're real
                 stocks, they're just...

                               TERESA
                 Never gonna make anybody money.
                      (a few beats; then)
                 Wouldn't you feel better selling
                 this junk to rich people, who can
                 afford to lose the money at least?

                 Why not?

      And on Jordan's look:

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Because they're too smart, that's

      The camera PUSHES IN on Jordan as he stands before a
      large dry erase board.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 But what if they didn't sound like
                 jerk-offs? What if I took this
                 bunch of nincompoops and molded
                 them in my own image? I
                 reinvented the company, gave it a
                 new image, a new name. Something
                 patrician, blue-blooded, something
                 that reeked of tradition and anti-
                 semitism.

      And as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs--

                 Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton
                 Oakmont.   The clients we've gone
                 after in the past -- they're done.

                In military terms it's like carpet-
                bombing -- noisy, menacing and
                only marginally effective. As
                Stratton brokers you will be laser-
                guided smart-bombs aimed at high-
                priority targets. You will
                establish an initial relationship
                with your clients selling only
                blue chip stocks -- then and only
                then will you attempt to sell the
                pink sheets, where the real money
                is. Now the key to every sale is
                this:

     Jordan writes the word "URGENCY" on the board.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                No one buys stock unless he thinks
                it's going up and going up now.
                You must convince your client to
                buy before the takeover happens,
                before the lawsuit is settled,
                before the patent is granted.
                If he says I'll think about it and
                call you back, it's over, you're
                dead! No one calls back! So you
                have to create urgency --


48   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY              48

     Another day. With Stratton Oakmont signage visible in
     the b.g., Jordan is on speakerphone with a potential
     CLIENT, the other Brokers listening in.

                              JORDAN
                --and once Kodak settles the
                lawsuit, institutions will be
                permitted to buy their shares in
                large blocks again. And when that
                happens, which is any day now,
                what do you think will happen to
                the price of Kodak stock?

                                CLIENT   (O.S.)
                It'll go up?

                              JORDAN
                Exactly. Which is why you should
                pick up 5000 shares today, a
                $200,000 investment.

                Then you wait. Whoever speaks
                first loses. At this point, where
                are we in the sale? Chester?

                About to close?

                              JORDAN
                No, you sweet and sour douchebag!
                We're at the beginning of the
                beginning! This is where the sale
                starts. You as a salesman are
                almost hoping he says no so you
                can finally do your fucking job!

                think, he's gotta ask his wife!
                The fact is it doesn't matter what
                the fuck he says! If he's already
                agreed that the stock's going up,
                then the only real objection he
                has at this point is he doesn't
                trust you! And he shouldn't trust
                you, you're a fucking salesman!
                So what do you say?

                              DONNIE
                Let me ask you this, sir -- had I
                been your broker for the past
                three to four years and made you
                money on a consistent basis, you
                probably wouldn't say you need to
                think about it, you'd probably say
                pick me up three or four thousand
                shares, am I right?

                                CLIENT #2 (O.S.)

                Wait a second. You mean to tell

                And to celebrate with a weekly act
                of debauchery, I have offered our

                Harrison ten thousand dollars to                    *
                have her head shaved!

     Jordan motions to DANIELLE HARRISON, 19, pretty, sitting       *
     in a chair nearby. Behind her, Rugrat uses clippers to
     shave her thick brown mane. The place goes nuts.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                FYI, Danielle tells me she's using
                the money for breast implants! Is
                this a great company or what?!!

     More wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen
     to Donnie. We hear the opening strains of "Stars &
     Stripes Forever" as he opens the door to a

     COLLEGE MARCHING BAND

     dressed in underwear and hats. The music continues as
     somersaulting GYMNASTS and BATON-TWIRLERS bring up the
     rear. As they march through the bullpen to cheers--

     FROM THE KITCHEN -- two dozen TUXEDO-CLAD WAITERS emerge
     carrying trays of champagne and hors d'oeuvres. The
     music continues as two dozen STRIPPERS bolt in, gyrating
     among the BROKERS. As Jordan surveys the insanity:

70   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT II - BULLPEN - LATER THAT DAY            70

     Bustling with activity. Jordan enters, crosses toward
     his office. Off to the side of the bullpen, he notices
     three dozen YOUNG MEN in business suits. He approaches
     his assistant JANET, 20s, dressed all in black.

                              JORDAN

                The Forbes article.    They're
                applying for jobs.

     They spot Jordan, start clamoring, waving their resumes.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                Forbes had made me a superstar.
                Every day dozens of money-crazed
                kids beat a path to my door with
                resumes they hadn't even bothered
                to spellcheck.

     Jordan crosses through the packed bullpen, where 150
     BROKERS, no older than 22, are crammed elbow to elbow
     talking into phones. Some have pets, which they tend to
     while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a
     chimp. Others are getting shoulder rubs by Masseuses
     or being fitted for suits by a TAILOR. Over the above:

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                If we hired `em, they dropped out
                of college overnight and blew
                whatever allowance they had on a
                new suit from our in-house tailor.
                The median age of our brokerage
                couldn't get served in the bar
                down the street.

     PATRICK DENHAM sits sipping coffee as he reads Forbes.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Not this guy though -- what the
                fuck is he even doing here? He
                read the Forbes article, too, but
                he already had a job.

     CLOSE ON two BROKERS wrestling while others cheer them
     on. PULL BACK to reveal the place from the opening. 300
     young Brokers and their hot ASSISTANTS work the phones.

                Within months, we doubled in size,
                moved to even bigger offices.

     Two other Brokers pump themselves up, chest-bumping and
     screaming like football players.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                It was a madhouse, a greed-fest,
                with equal parts cocaine,
                testosterone and body fluids.

73    INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - MEN'S ROOM - DAY (MAR `92)             73

      In a stall, two Brokers snort coke, while another Broker
      fucks a Sales Assistant perched on the sink.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 I had to declare the office a fuck-
                 free zone between the hours of 9
                 and 7, but even that didn't help.

      Taped to the mirror we see a MEMO -- inside a red circle,
      two anatomically correct stick figures fuck doggy-style,
      a red line slashing through them.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Actually the madness started on
                 our very first day, when one of
                 our brokers, Ben Jenner,
                 christened the elevator by
                 getting a blowjob from a sales
                 assistant.

                 Her name was Pam and   to her
                 credit, she did have   an amazing
                 technique, with this   wild twist
                 and jerk motion.

                 Eventually Ben married her, which
                 was pretty amazing considering she
                 blew every guy in the office.

      bathroom floor, a gun near his head, which oozes blood.

                 Anyway, in an attempt to maintain
                 order, I hired my dad Max as
                 defacto CFO and head of the

75C   INT. JORDAN'S PARENTS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT         75C

      MAX BELFORT sits smoking, watching a rerun of "The
      Equalizer" on TV. His wife, LEAH, does needlepoint.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 We called him Mad Max because of
                 his hair-trigger temper, which
                 could be set off by something as
                 innocuous as a ringing telephone.

      The phone RINGS.

                               MAX
                 Who the hell has the goddamn gall
                 to call this house on a Tuesday
                 evening! Goddammit!

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 But then the weirdest thing would
                 happen. Though he'd never been
                 near England, he'd pick up the
                 phone and affect an ever-so-slight
                 British accent.

      Greatly agitated, Max stomps toward the phone.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 This was his other persona -- the
                 super polite, ever-gracious Sir
                 Max.

                               MAX
                      (into phone)
                 Hello?... Yes, Gene, right-eo.
                 Good-good then... Cheerio.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 It was absolutely bizarre. He'd
                 hang up...

                               MAX
                      (hangs up phone)
                 Goddamn fucking halfwit!

      Jordan takes the bill, starts flipping through it.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 In Stratton parlance, there were
                 three kinds of hookers. There
                 were blue chips, the top of the
                 line. Model material. They were
                 priced between $300 and $500 and
                 made you wear a condom unless you
                 gave them a hefty tip, which I
                 always did.

                 Then came NASDAQs, who were
                 pretty, but not great, usually
                 in the two to three hundred
                 dollar range.

                 Finally there were pink sheets,

                 They usually cost a hundred or
                 less, and if you didn't wear a
                 condom, you'd get a penicillin
                 shot the next day and pray your
                 dick didn't fall off.

      and Donnie out the door.

                 Give us a minute, will you, guys?

      He closes the door, then stretches a bit, exaggeratedly,
      letting out a little moan.

                 What's the matter?

79   INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - (LATER THAT) DAY                79

     GORGEOUS PEOPLE dance/drink/snort coke. Upstairs, Jordan
     plays pool with Sea Otter, Donnie, Robbie, Toby and
     Rugrat, assigning ludes with every pocketed ball.

                              JORDAN
                Exactly. We do our own IPO's and
                we will print money.

                              SEA OTTER

                 We've got Arncliffe National,
                 they're looking to go public,
                 we've got --

                               DONNIE
                      (very luded)
                 Oh, oh, Steve... Steve...

                                 JORDAN

                               DONNIE
                 ...Steve... M-m-madden...

      Donnie gesticulates wildly. The guys crack up. WE PUSH
      IN ON Donnie, practically drooling, as Jordan gives us a
      quick tutorial on ludes...

79A   QUAALUDE TUTORIAL                                              *79A

      CUT TO: Extreme close up of guys doing drugs.                  *

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The quaalude was first synthesized
                 in 1951 by an Indian doctor --
                 that's dot Indian, not feathers --
                 as a sedative, and was prescribed
                 to stressed housewives with sleep
                 disorders. Pretty soon someone
                 figured out that if you resisted
                 the urge to sleep for fifteen
                 minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass
                 high from it. Didn't take long
                 for people to start abusing ludes,
                 `course, and in 1982 the U.S.
                 Government Schedule One'd them,
                 along with the rest of the world.
                 Which meant there was only a
                 finite amount of these things
                 left. No shit, you can't even
                 find `em anymore today. You
                 people're all shit outta luck.

                         DONNIE
           Ssshhhhoes... shhhoooess...

Jordan suspects Donnie may actually be onto something.
But just then...

                           SEA OTTER
           Holy fuck.

Jordan peers over the balcony where Sea Otter's looking.

NAOMI LAPAGLIA. 22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered
the party with her date BLAIR. She smiles, full lips
parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short
dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts.

                         RUGRAT
           My nutsack's about to explode.

                         ROBBIE                                *
           Someone's gotta take that down.

There's no debate who that someone should be. Eyes
locked on Naomi, Jordan makes his way downstairs.

WITH NAOMI taking in the party, her eyes flitting to
things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.

                         NAOMI (V.O.)
           A lotta people would look at me
           and think: "golddigger, she's out
           to land the richest husband she
           can." But you see, I came from
           nothing. Like, below the poverty
           line. And when you come from
           nothing, being rich means never
           having to go back to that.

Jordan approaches CRISTY, 20s, one of his guests.

                         CRISTY
           Jordan, hey.
                (he smiles; Cristy
                 picks up his intent)
           Have you met my friend Naomi?

Jordan takes Naomi's hand, doesn't let go.

                           JORDAN
           Naomi.

                         NAOMI
           You have an awesome house. I
           don't think I've ever been in a
           house like this.

                         JORDAN
           You like it? I just got it. I
           guess it's okay. Six bedrooms,
           two hot-tubs, one off the master
           suite overlooking the water. You
           like to jet-ski?

Naomi's date Blair offers his hand to break them apart.
Toby Welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye.

                          BLAIR
           Hi.   Blair Hollingsworth.

Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi.

Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa. Her eyes stray
to Jordan chatting up Naomi. Teresa's eyes follow hers
and sees them. Ouch. Hildy goes.

                         JORDAN
           You're telling me you've never jet-
           ski'ed in your life?!

                           NAOMI
           Never.

                         BLAIR
           Y'know, we really should hit it,
           there's two other parties we're
           s'posed to get to --

                           JORDAN
           What?    You just got here.   Stay.

Naomi looks like she'd like to.     Hildy approaches,
introduces herself, then:

                         HILDY
           Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

                           JORDAN
           With what?

                         HILDY
           I dunno, you'll have to ask your
           wife what she wants.

Jordan sees: Teresa is watching from afar.

                         DONNIE(O.S.)
           Oh sweet Jesus!

Jordan turns to see a drunk Donnie, cock in hand, jerking
off to Naomi. Hildy comes running over.
                                                                   44.

                Donnie!   What the fuck are you
                doing?!

     During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing
     Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party --

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                The day I met Naomi was the day I
                truly became the Wolf. Every guy
                wanted her -- so I had to have
                her.

     -- Jordan watches her go. Naomi shoots a glance back to
     him and, like that, he's hooked.

82   INT. SIGN OF THE DOVE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT         (JUN `92)         82

     Romantic; elegant. Over a bottle of `53 Lafite, Jordan
     sits in mid conversation with Naomi, who is stunning in a
     low-cut black cocktail dress.

                                  JORDAN
                Bay Ridge.      That's near Staten
                Island?

                              NAOMI
                Brooklyn, across the Verrazano
                Bridge. Guinea gulch. Ever been?

                              JORDAN
                You're Italian?

                              NAOMI
                My dad's side. Also Dutch,
                German, English -- I'm a mutt.
                Actually I have family over there,
                in London. My Aunt Emma.

                              JORDAN
                That explains it then.

                                  NAOMI
                What?

                              JORDAN

                You're a Duchess. The Duchess of

     Naomi smiles, flags a passing WAITER.
                                                              45.

                Could I have a straw please?

     The Waiter nods, heads off.     A few beats, then:

                              NAOMI (CONT'D)
                So I was a little surprised you
                asked Cristy for my number.

                                JORDAN
                How come?

                              NAOMI
                Aren't you married?

                              JORDAN
                Married people can't have friends?

     Naomi smiles. The Waiter brings the straw. She opens
     it, slips it in her red wine glass. Off Jordan's look:

                              NAOMI
                So I don't stain my teeth.

     And as she sips the wine seductively through the straw...


83   EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT                                   83

     Jordan's Ferrari makes its way over the bridge, heading
     back toward Brooklyn.

                              NAOMI (O.S.)
                --then at night I do my designs.


84   INT. JORDAN'S FERRARI - CONTINUOUS                             84

     Jordan drives, Naomi next to him.

                              NAOMI
                An entire line of lingerie --
                camisoles, bustiers, panties.

     Jordan glances over -- her dress is riding up her thigh.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                She designs panties?! Jesus
                fucking Christ!

     Naomi smiles.

                              JORDAN
                Sounds like something I might
                invest in. Venture capital.

                touch, then.

                                 JORDAN
                Absolutely.

     He pulls over outside her brownstone.

                Think, Jordan, think! How can you
                get up to her apartment?!

     They look at each other.     We can almost hear Jordan's
     heart pounding.

                              NAOMI
                You wanna come up for some tea?

     A small, cozy apartment. Naomi enters, Jordan close
     behind. She picks up Rocky, her yapping Maltese.

                                 NAOMI
                Say hi, Rocky.

     Naomi waves Rocky's paw.     Jordan smiles.

                              NAOMI (CONT'D)
                Why don't you light a fire? I'll
                be right out.

     Jordan nods, takes in her scent as she walks away.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                God, please help me. How can I
                fuck this girl?

     As he crouches by the fireplace, his skypager vibrates.
     He checks the readout: "Teresa". His face falls as he
     hits the "silent" button, mind racing with guilt.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                That's it, you're leaving. You're
                going home to your wife.

     Jordan stands, turns around -- NAOMI is in the doorway,
     naked except for high heels.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                As you can probably guess, I
                fucked her goddamn brains out.

     Rocky yaps incessantly as Jordan pounds away atop Naomi.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                For eleven seconds.

     Jordan cums loudly, convulsively.

                Yeah, but I'm still hard.

     Jordan looks down at her.

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Being inside her... was like your
                cock went to heaven and God
                himself was cupping your balls.

     And as they start fucking again...

     BACK to see the apartment is packed with flowers.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Every chance we got, we'd sneak
                off together...


89   INT. LIMOSINE - NIGHT (AUG `92)                                 89

     Giggling like a child, Jordan pours coke from a vial,
     creating a little mound atop one of Naomi's breasts.

                              JORDAN

     More giggling, then he snorts the coke off her breast,
     burying his face in it as he climbs on top of her. Naomi
     laughs uncontrollably as the limo glides to a stop. The
     door opens from outside -- the Doorman?

                              TERESA (O.S.)
                Get out of the fucking car.

     Jordan looks up, locks eyes with Teresa. He jumps off
     Naomi, stumbles out, closing the door behind himself.

     The limo takes off.    Teresa starts crying...

                You're like a totally different
                person.

                               JORDAN
                I'm not. I'm sorry.        I made a
                mistake, okay?

                              TERESA

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                I felt horrible.

     Jordan holds her, letting her cry.

     Completely remodelled, all new furniture.   Jordan and
     Naomi sit at the table, set for a candle-light dinner.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                Say what you will, but the Duchess
                did have style. She brought in a
                decorator, feng shui'd the place--
                she even hired a gay butler.

     NICHOLAS THE BUTLER, 40s, enters with hot towels on a
     silver tray.

                              JORDAN
                Thank you, Nicholas.

     Jordan takes a towel, wipes his face.      Naomi smiles.

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                He was smart, sophisticated,

                It gets worse. After I chased

     With Nicholas seated in a chair, Jordan sits across from
     him. Pacing behind him is Donnie, coked-up, face
     contorted, frothing with rage. Nearby, giant Chester
     Ming sits quietly, saying nothing.

                              JORDAN
                I just want my stuff back, okay?

                              NICHOLAS THE BUTLER

                I should kill you, cocksucker!
                You do not fuck with this man!

     Jordan holds Donnie off.    Turns back to Nicholas.

                              JORDAN
                You were high, things got out of
                control, I get it. Believe me I
                do, I have a Phd in debauchery.

                won't stand for is being robbed.

                              NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
                I'm telling you the truth.

                Fine.

     Jordan nods to Chester. Without a word, he crosses to
     Nicholas and BAMMM!! Nicholas's nose splits open like a
     ripe plum, blood spurting everywhere. Tough-guy Donnie
     takes one look, then SPEWS vomit into a garbage pail.
     And as Chester pummels Nicholas's face into chopped
     meat...

                              JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                It's amazing the kind of loyalty
                money will buy. I mean Chester
                almost killed this prick.

     Chester starts to hang Nicholas over the balcony by his
     legs. Jordan stops him.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                I finally called the cops, mainly
                to save Nicholas's life.

     With the bloodied Nicholas in the background, Jordan
     talks to two NYPD COPS, handing them each a wad of cash.

                              JORDAN (V.O.)
                I gave them each a thousand bucks
                and told them what Nicholas had
                done. Then they kicked his ass.

     As the Cops swat Nicholas with their nightsticks:

      some hookers, Brad pulls up in a golf cart with a cash-        *
      filled gym bag.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Besides Brad, I had eight other
                 `ratholes', close friends who'd
                 own stock on paper, but kick the
                 profits back to me after I drove
                 the price through the roof.

      They hug, then Jordan adds the gym bag to several others
      on the back of his golf cart. Donnie tries to befriend
      Brad; Brad isn't interested.

           What the fuck is this imbecile

Max crosses off, starts screaming at the break-dancing
Broker. Jordan keeps walking with Manny.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           The SEC sent two lawyers down to
           review our files, so I set them
           up in our conference room.

Jordan passes the conference room, looks in the window--
two SEC ATTORNEYS wear coats as they review documents.

Brokers working the phones.

      dozen in mid-orgy with Hookers, naked in the aisle as
      others pour champagne on them.

                 All told, the weekend cost me
                 almost two million dollars--

      The Tangiers Presidential Suite is a shambles on the           *
      level of Hiroshima. A giant crystal chandelier lays
      shattered on the floor; Jordan asleep in the massive bed,
      a Blue Chip Hooker on either side of him; other passed-
      out BODIES lay amid debris and broken, toppled furniture.

                 But the wedding was like something
                 out of a fairy tale--


109   EXT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - SUNSET      (DEC `92)              109

      Gorgeous; tropical. Hundreds of FAMILY and FRIENDS
      (Janet, Toby Welch, Peter DeBlasio and Kimmie Belzer)
      look on as Jordan and Naomi walk up the aisle.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 --with Naomi my Duchess, me her
                 handsome Duke and The Bahamas

      Jordan and Naomi waltz, their Guests joining in.

                 Of course after that bachelor
                 party, the Duke needed a few
                 penicillin shots so he could
                 safely consummate the marriage.

      As Jordan and Naomi mingle with a few Strattonites,
      videographer BARRY KLEINMAN, 40s, approaches Rugrat and
      his DATE, ABBY with a video camera:

                               BARRY KLEINMAN
                 I'm Barry Kleinman, filming the
                 wedding -- would you like to say
                 something to Jordan and Naomi?

                                   RUGRAT / ABBY
                 Good luck!      We love you!

      Across the way, Naomi spots someone through the crowd--

                                NAOMI
                 Omigod!   Aunt Emma!

      Naomi rushes over, hugs her AUNT EMMA, 50s, demure,
      British. Naomi turns, calls out to Jordan, who is now in
      a huddle with the guys, his back to her.

                                   NAOMI (CONT'D)
                 Jordan!   Look!

      Jordan turns, then crosses to them, smiling.

                               AUNT EMMA
                 Jordan dear, how lovely.

                               JORDAN
                 It's so nice to see you again.

      As he leans in to hug her, Aunt Emma spots some white
      powder on the edge of Jordan's nostril. Deftly, she
      wipes it off, smiling.

                               AUNT EMMA
                 Into the donuts, I see.

                               JORDAN
                 Oh, I'm--- uh...

      Aunt Emma leans in to his ear.

                                AUNT EMMA
                 I lived through the 60s, my dear.
                 Enjoy the day.

      And with that, she turns back to Naomi.


112   EXT. BAHAMAS - MARINA - DAY       (DEC `92)                      112

      With Naomi wearing a blindfold, Jordan leads her to the
      end of a long dock, expensive yachts moored everywhere.

                                  JORDAN
                 Careful now.     You ready?

      Jordan removes her blindfold -- there, towering above the
      others, is a stunning, 120 foot yacht.
                                                                       57.

                      What is this?

                                    JORDAN
                      Your wedding present.       Check out
                      the name.

           She does; it's called "Naomi".     As she squeals, hugs him-

           The camera PUSHES IN past a white-jacketed STEWARD,
           who opens the door to the yacht's main salon; next we see
           the living room, with its full bar and leather couches;
           then the bedroom, with a king bed and monogrammed sheets.

           ludes, sunbathing blissfully on the deck.

116   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB `95)            116

      Amid billowing piles of white Chinese silk, Jordan sleeps
      on his back, snoring blissfully.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                 It   was heaven on earth.

      On screen WE SEE:

                          18 MONTHS LATER

      Splash!   A glass of water hits him in the face.

                               NAOMI
                 Wake up, you bag of shit!

      Soaking wet, Jordan sits upright to see Naomi standing
      over him in a tiny pink chemise, holding an empty glass.

                               JORDAN
                 The fuck are you doing?!

                                   NAOMI
                 Who's Venice?

                                   JORDAN
                 What?!

                               NAOMI
                 Who is she?! Some little hooker
                 you fucked last night?

                                   JORDAN
                 What?    No!    Naomi!

      And as Naomi storms off for a re-fill...


117   INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE        (FEB `95)              117

      Jordan lies on the ground, hands tied with a lit candle          *
      up his ass.                                                      *

      Back to scene. Naomi holds another full glass, rocking
      back and forth on the balls of her feet like a fighter.

                               NAOMI
                 You were calling her name in your
                 sleep!

                               JORDAN
                 I can explain everything.

                               NAOMI
                 Go ahead. More lies from the man
                 who lies for a living!

                               JORDAN
                 No, really. Donnie and me, we're
                 investing in a condo development
                 in Venice.

                                 NAOMI
                 Italy?!

                               JORDAN
                 California, baby.

                                 NAOMI
                 Yeah, right.

                               JORDAN
                 Duchess, come on.

                               NAOMI
                 Don't `Duchess' me, you scumbag.
                 You think I don't know what you're
                 up to? You're a father now and
                 you act like an infant!

      Splash!   She nails him again, crosses for more water.

                                 JORDAN
                 Fuck. Naomi!    Why are you so mad?

                               NAOMI
                 Where do you want me to start?
                 How about you flying in here on
                 your stupid helicopter at three in
                 the morning waking up Skylar?!


119   EXT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - YARD - NIGHT      (FEB `95)              119

      Jordan crash-lands the helicopter on the driving range.         *
      He exits, gives Captain Dave a salute, fights his way           *
      through the bushes, then stumbles toward the house and          *
      falls into the pool, stoned out of his skull. Security          *
      floodlights come on and the alarm sounds.                       *

                               NAOMI (O.S.)
                 Does it even matter to you that I
                 just had that driving range sodded
                 with Bermuda grass?


120   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB `95)          120

      Back to scene.   Naomi holds another glass of water.

                               NAOMI
                 But why should you give a shit?
                 You're not the one who researched
                 the fucking thing and dealt with
                 the fucking golf course people!

                               JORDAN
                 You're an aspiring landscape
                 architect?! But what happened to
                 wine connoisseur? Oh wait, that
                 was last month!

                                 NAOMI
                 Fuck you!

      Naomi winds up with the water glass. Jordan stands tall,
      puffs himself up, arms flexed at his sides.

                                NAOMI (CONT'D)
                 Stop flexing your arms, you look
                 like a fucking imbecile.
                       (re: his crotch)
                 And don't think that impresses me
                 much.

      Jordan looks down: he has a morning erection.

                               JORDAN
                 I wasn't flexing my arms. You're
                 just lucky to have a husband who's
                 in such great shape. Now get over
                 here and kiss me!

                                 NAOMI
                 Kiss you?!

      Splash! She nails him one last time, then storms out.
      He stands there dripping wet. To his erection:

                               JORDAN
                 Where the fuck were you last
                 night?

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 My morning ritual. First I'd get
                 up and fight with Naomi about
                 whatever I did the night before.
                                                                  61.

120A   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - STEAM SHOWER - DAY                        120A

       Jordan stands in the steaming shower.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Next it was a steam so I could
                  sweat out whatever drugs were
                  still in my system.


120B   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS              120B

       Jordan looks at himself in the mirror.      His eyes are
       bloodshot - he looks like shit.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  After that I'd assess the damage.

       Jordan looks at a Visine bottle - "Recommended Dosage -
       Two Drops". He squirts six drops in each eye.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  What kind of maniac abuses eye
                  drops?


121    INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY (FEB `95)             121

       Fully dressed and standing amid hundreds of suits, Jordan
       pops two white pills, swigs some juice.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Then I'd get dressed, take my
                  "back pills" to get me started,
                  then attempt to make up with her.


122    INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - SKYLAR'S ROOM - DAY (FEB `95)             122

       Jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland. On the fluffy
       pink carpet is Naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her
       hips, Manolo Blahniks showing polished red toes. Between
       her legs sits SKYLAR, their 5-month-old daughter.

                                  JORDAN
                  Hey, Skylar.

                                 NAOMI

                  Good morning Daddy. Where's my
                  kiss?

       Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up.
                                                         62.

                         JORDAN
                (playing along)
           Does Daddy get to kiss both his
           girls?

                         NAOMI
           Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get
           to touch Mommy for a very, very
           long time.

Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she's
wearing no panties. The wind goes out of Jordan.

                         JORDAN
           C'mon, Nay, please. You know how
           sorry I am. I swear I--

                         NAOMI
                (cutting him off)
           Daddy shouldn't waste his time.
           And from now on it's going to be
           nothing but short, short skirts
           around the house! And Mommy's
           so sick and tired of wearing
           panties, uhhh. In fact she's
           decided to throw them all away.
                (parting her thighs)
           So take a good look. You'll be
           seeing an awful lot of it around
           the house, but no touching.

She licks her lips seductively.     Jordan sets Skylar
aside, starts grovelling.

                         NAOMI (CONT'D)
           What's wrong, Daddy?

Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking
it. Jordan can barely speak.

                         JORDAN
           C'mon, why are you doing this?
           I said I'm sorry.

                         NAOMI
                (pouting)
           Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to
           say how wrong he is when he's
           ready to come in his own pants.
           Isn't that right Dada? Mommy loves
           Daddy so, so much and there's
           nothing she wants to do more right
           now than to make love to Daddy all
           day long. Well, I guess it's time
           for Daddy to be taught his first
           lesson.
                                                                  63.
       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages     3/5/13

      Naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her
      inner thigh, then up toward her vagina. Jordan watches
      transfixed, then a change comes over him...

                               JORDAN
                 I wouldn't do that if I were you
                 Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a
                 story before she decides to please
                 herself like that.
                 Can Daddy tell Mommy a story?
                      (off her nod)
                 And does mommy promise to keep her
                 legs spread wide, wide open the
                 whole time?
                      (she nods dreamily)
                 Good. Once upon a time there was
                 a great big mansion in Long Island
                 and the people who lived there had
                 lots and lots of money. But of
                 all the possessions they had,
                 there was one thing that was much
                 more valuable than all the rest
                 combined, and that was their
                 little baby daughter.

      Naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch.

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)
                 Now because he was very security-
                 conscious, the Daddy hired two
                 full-time guards, big hairy men
                 both named Rocco, and they
                 installed security cameras all
                 around the house. And one of
                 those cameras is right over
                 Daddy's shoulder.

      Naomi's eyes widen -- she look toward a Teddy Bear on a
      shelf. WE SEE that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera.

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)
                 So smile, Mommy! You're on Candid
                 Camera!


123   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - GUARD HOUSE - DAY        (FEB `95)         123

      Mesmerized, ROCCO DAY watches a video screen, on which we
      see a grainy image of Naomi, hand between her legs.


124   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - SKYLAR'S BEDROOM - DAY (FEB `95)           124

      Naomi jumps up as if she's been electrocuted.

                                 NAOMI
                 You asshole!
                                                                64.

      As she bolts from the room, Jordan plays with Skylar...

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The good thing about living with
                 a world-class ballbreaker is they
                 make all the other ballbreakers in
                 your life a little easier to take.


125   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - OUTSIDE JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY       125
      (FEB `95)

      Donnie stands talking with Jordan's assistant, Janet.
      Jordan approaches under a head of steam.

                                  DONNIE
                 There he is.

                               JORDAN
                      (a quick hug; then)
                 Steve here yet?

                                  DONNIE
                 On his way.     Very excited.

                                JORDAN
                 Good.   Cuz we have a problem.

      He indicates out to the Bullpen.      Donnie and Janet look.

                               JANET
                      (incredulous)
                 Is he wearing a bow tie?

      In the Bullpen WE SEE a young Stratton Broker in a bowtie
      cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk.

                               JORDAN
                 He's got nothing better to do on
                 the day of the biggest IPO in this
                 firm's history?!

      Jordan watches as Donnie marches toward the Broker in a
      bowtie...


126   INT. BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS                                       126

                               DONNIE
                 The fuck you doing?

                               BROKER IN A BOWTIE
                      (bewildered)
                 Cleaning my fishbowl.

                                  DONNIE
                 Oh.
                                                                65.
        The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

       Donnie nods, turns to go, but suddenly he turns back and
       thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming
       goldfish. The Broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified.

                                DONNIE(CONT'D)
                  On new issue day?! On
                  cocksucking, motherfucking
                  new issue day?!

       Dozen of Brokers and Sales Assistants look over as Donnie
       snatches up the fish. Holding it by its tail, he jumps         *
       up on the desk of the Broker in a bowtie. Now the entire
       Bullpen looks over.

                                DONNIE(CONT'D)
                  This is what happens when you fuck
                  with your pets on new issue day!

       With the flair of a showman, Donnie pops the fish in his
       mouth, swallowing it whole. The Brokers cheer wildly.
       Donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the Broker in a
       bowtie:

                                DONNIE(CONT'D)
                  Now take your bowtie, get your
                  shit and get the fuck out!

       Bowtie is stunned. And as Donnie storms off, we PUSH IN
       on Jordan, watching from across the room.


127    INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY              127
       (FEB `95)

       Jordan finishes a phone call as Donnie enters with STEVE
       MADDEN, 30s, dressed in wrinkled navy blazer, cargo pants
       and T-shirt, a baseball cap over his scraggly, thinning
       hair. Jordan smiles, crosses to greet him.

                                  JORDAN
                  The Cobbler.    Ready to get rich?

                                  STEVE MADDEN
                  Hey buddy.

       And as they ad lib greetings, settle in at the couch:

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Steve Madden, the shoe designer,
                  was a childhood friend of
                  Donnie's, but I didn't hold that
                  against him. Remember those ads,
                  those giant-headed girls with bug
                  eyes wearing those big clunky
                  shoes?

                 He came to me a few years earlier
                 when he was just starting out, so
                 I became a silent partner in his
                 company, buying an 85% stake for
                 only a million bucks.


128   INT. STEVE MADDEN SHOES - DAY                                     128

      WE SEE various stores, all packed with teenage GIRLS
      buying shoes and boots.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The company blew up and we were
                 now taking it public. It was the
                 biggest deal we'd ever done and
                 the hottest IPO on Wall Street.


129   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN'S OFFICE - DAY                 129
      (FEB `95)

      Jordan and Donnie sit with Steve Madden in mid-
      conversation.

                               DONNIE
                 --which is why they need to meet
                 you.

                               JORDAN
                 You gotta get `em fired up so
                 they'll push the shit out of this
                 stock.

                               DONNIE
                 Let them feel your passion.


130   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY       (FEB `95)         130

      Bustling with activity. With Jordan and Donnie looking
      on from nearby, Steve Madden approaches a microphone on
      the raised platform, in his hands several shoe boxes.

                               STEVE MADDEN
                      (into mic)
                 Uhhh... excuse me...

      The place slowly comes to order.

                               STEVE MADDEN (CONT'D)
                 For those of you who don't know
                 me, my name is Steve Madden. I'm --

                               ONE BROKER
                 We know who you are!
                                                          67.
 The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

Steve clears his throat, looks over at Jordan -- he's
terrified. Jordan motions for him to calm down.

                          STEVE MADDEN
           I uh, I'd like to start by telling
           you about my background in the
           shoe industry.

                         ANOTHER BROKER
           Nice fucking hat!

                         STEVE MADDEN
           I uh... first started working in
           the shoe industry, in a shoe
           store. When I was sixteen, my
           friends were out chasing girls,
           but I was learning about women's
           shoes.

Move the mike closer.             We can't fucking hear you!

He moves the mic; feedback SCREECHES through the bullpen.

                         STEVE MADDEN (CONT'D)
           Sorry... Anyway, my first job
           was at a shoe store like I said
           where I worked in the stockroom.
           You know, I can honestly say I've
           been a lover of women's shoes
           since I was twelve--

                            BROKER #4
           Freak!

                         STEVE MADDEN
           No. Heh-heh. Not like that.
           I mean somehow I became fascinated
           with the endless design
           possibilities for women's shoes--


          BROKER #5                        BROKER #6
Queer!                            Get a fucking life!

Boos, hisses. Steve looks at Jordan, who motions for him
to speed up. He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes.

                            STEVE MADDEN (CONT'D)
           This shoe --    the Mary Lou -- is
           the one that    really put me on the
           map. It's a     black patent leather
           variation of    the Mary Jane, but--

SPLAT! A half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steve's feet.
In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic--
                                                           68.
 The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13

                         JORDAN
           All right, let's hear it for Steve
           Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!

Huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           Okay, now that you got that out
           of your system, I want you to know
           why Steve is so completely off the
           fucking wall... It's because this
           man is a creative genius. Steve's
           power, his gift -- is that he
           creates trends. Artists like
           Steve come along once a century!
           Elvis! Andy Warhol!    Giorgio
           Armani! Who knows how high this
           stock could go? The 20s? The
           50s? The 80s?

Applause; war whoops.      Jordan motions for quiet.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           I want everybody to look down.
           See that little black box in front
           of you? It's called a telephone.
           Now I'm gonna let you in on a
           little secret about this
           telephone -- it won't dial itself!
           That's right -- until you take
           some action, it's nothing more
           than a worthless hunk of plastic,
           like a loaded M16 without a
           trained Marine to pull the
           trigger. And in the case of the
           telephone, it's the action of you,
           a highly trained Strattonite, a
           killer who will not take no for an
           answer!   A person who will not
           hang up the phone until his client
           either buys or fucking dies!

The Brokers go crazy.      Jordan looks around.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           I don't care if you graduated from
           Harvard or Bumfuck University or
           never got past fourth fucking
           grade! That phone is the great
           equalizer!
                (pause; looks around)
           There is no nobility in poverty.
           I've been rich, and I've been poor
           and I choose rich every time.

           At least as a rich man, when I
           have to face my problems, I show
           up in the back of a limo wearing a
           $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch!

Jordan takes off his GOLD WATCH, flings it to the Crowd.
Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           And if anyone here thinks I'm
           crazy, get the fuck out and get a
           job at McDonald's, because that's
           where you fucking belong! But
           before you depart this room full
           of winners, I want you to take a
           good look at the person next to
           you, because one day in the not-so-
           distant future, you'll be sitting
           at a red light in your beat-up old
           Pinto, and that person's gonna
           pull up in a brand new Porsche,
           with their gorgeous young wife at
           their side. And who will you be
           next to? Some ugly beast with
           three days of razor-stubble in a
           sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in
           next to you with a carload of
           groceries from the fucking Price
           Club!

He scans the Brokers; they're on the edge of their seats.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           So you listen to me and listen
           carefully. Are you behind on your
           credit card bills? Good. Pick up
           the phone and start dialing. Is
           your landlord threatening to evict
           you? Good. Pick up the phone and
           start dialing. Does your
           girlfriend think you're a fucking
           loser? Pick up the phone and
           start fucking dialing! I want
           you to deal with your problems by
           becoming rich! I want you to go
           out and spend money! Leverage
           yourself, back yourself into a
           corner, let the consequences of
           failure become so fucking
           unthinkable that you'll have no
           choice but to do whatever it takes
           to win!

The Brokers go absolutely APESHIT.

                  Of course I couldn't have done
                  this without help. I'd leaked the
                  word on Wall Street that Stratton
                  was a buyer up until twenty. So
                  not only were we pushing Madden,
                  all the big firms were too.

       We continue PANNING the frenzied Brokers...

      Donnie pours champagne nearby, oblivious to Jordan, who
      sits at his desk, speaking directly to camera:

                 Of the two million shares being
                 offered for sale, a million
                 belonged to me, held in phony
                 accounts by my ratholes. Once the
                 price hit the high teens, I--

      Jordan abruptly stops.     A beat, then:

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)
                 Like I said before, who gives a

      They toast, then each pop ludes, which they wash down
      with champagne. A quick knock; Janet pops her head in.

                    your wife, so that she starts
                    nagging you to turn witness.

                                BO DIETL
                  Jordan, relax. First off, you
                  don't fuck with these guys, not
                  that way. Secondly, I got a P.I.

                                BO DIETL
                  No! Anybody does that should be
                  your lawyer. What you do is eat
                  your dinner, drink your drink, and
                  forget about it. Cuz as far as I
                  hear he doesn't have shit.

       Jordan nods, wheels turning, pretending to do as told.

                  Patrick? Hey! C'mon aboard!

       They look up. On the yacht Naomi, Jordan stands waving,
       drinking wine with two Blue Chip HOOKERS in bikinis.

                                JORDAN (CONT'D)
                  Plank's right down there.

       Denham shares a look with his cohort: it's almost a joke,
       this display of wealth before a federal agent. Moments
       later, they step aboard.

                                AGENT DENHAM

           Agents Denham and Hughes. Your

           privately.

           It did. I do.
                (off Denham's stare)
           Oh, they're just friends.
                (to the girls)
           Give us a minute, okay?

The Hookers head below deck. Jordan shoots Denham a wink--
check out that ass!

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           Can I get a glass? Got wine open
           or any kinda booze. Shrimp and
           lobster're over there if you're
           hungry.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Bureau forbids us from drinking at
           sea.

Jordan surprised: the guy has a sense of humor.

                         JORDAN
           I have something for you, I just
           gotta find it. Have a seat, will
           ya? Ever been on one of these
           before?

As Jordan rifles through some papers, Denham's eyes scan
the deck, casually cataloguing everything.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           A boat? Learned to sail when I was
           six.

                         JORDAN
           I mean, one like this. Just had
           her extended to put a chopper on
           the back.

Jordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Never been on a boat with a second
           mode of transportation on top of
           it.

Jordan finds the file he's been looking for, offers it.

                         AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D)
                (before he'll accept)
           What is this?

                         JORDAN
           Names and addresses of every guest
           at my wedding. Friends, clients. I
           even threw in the seating chart.
           Heard that's why you wanted the
           video, figured this'd expedite
           whatever it is you're doing.
                (Denham looks: it's
                 indeed a guest list
                 from the wedding)
           I wanted to show you I've got
           nothing to hide. I know you're
           investigating Stratton but for the
           life of me I can't figure out why.
           Sure, my company is unorthodox;
           what brokerage isn't? Maybe we're
           a little louder than most but we
           don't do anything illegal. Talk to
           the SEC, they'll tell you, they
           checked us out up and down.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           The SEC's actually a civil
           regulatory agency. We pursue
           criminal activity.

                         JORDAN
           That's what I'm saying. You guys
           take on real crime. Which is why
           I'm so curious: what do you think
           we did?

The reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           I can't discuss ongoing
           investigations.

                           JORDAN
           I understand.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Though, to be frank, this case
           kinda got dumped on my desk. Some
           higher-up felt your shop needed
           looking into after all that press,
           fell on me to do the looking.

                         JORDAN
           You know who you should be looking
           at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers,
           Merrill.

           What those guys're up to with
           collateralized debt obligations?
           This internet stock bullshit?
           C'mon. If you want, I'll walk you
           through exactly --

                         AGENT DENHAM
           -- that'd be great. And if there's
           anything you can give me just to
           close out your file, get it off my
           desk--

                         JORDAN
           -- sure, get you back to the real
           criminals --

                         AGENT DENHAM
           -- then we could both profit from
           this little sit-down.

Jordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by "profit"?

                         JORDAN
           You sure you don't want anything
           to drink? Water for your pal?
                (Denham demurs)
           Rumor is your started out in
           finance. Even got your broker's
           license before you joined the
           bureau.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Who told you that?

                          JORDAN
                (searches his memory)
           Jeez, who was it...?
                (comes up short)
           Ever regret it? Giving up the
           money-crazed, pin-striped life?
           Ever think where you'd be if you'd
           stuck with it?

                         AGENT DENHAM
           When I'm riding the subway home,
           sweating my balls off, in a suit
           I've worn three days, sure.

                         JORDAN
           Whattaya pull in working at the
           bureau, if you don't mind me
           asking. 50-60K a year?

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Just about. We get a free handgun
           out of it, though, that doesn't
           suck.

                         JORDAN
           S'crazy, the world we live in, the
           jobs with real value, the ones we
           should appreciate -- firefighters,
           teachers, FBI agents -- those are
           the ones we pay the least.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Way of the world.

                         JORDAN
           That's one thing I like about what
           I do, the opportunity to make that
           right. Take this kid we had
           interning last year. Didn't want
           to be a broker, wanted to be an
           environmental scientist or
           something, he had a student loan
           debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway,
           his mom gets sick, all they can
           afford is third-rate care. Some of
           us got together, made an
           investment on his behalf and --
           boom -- overnight everything
           changes, she's seeing the best
           doctors in the country. Sadly,
           didn't work out, she passed but
           still: having the power to do that
           makes all the other bullshit worth
           while.
                (as Denham considers
                  that)
           See, it's all about proper
           guidance, Pat. Knowing someone
           with the right relationships,
           who's discreet. I can change a
           life almost every day.

They measure each other.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           How much that intern make off your
           deal?

                         JORDAN
           North of half a million.

Denham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan:

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Can you say that again, what you
           told me?
                (Jordan declines with
                 a smile; to Agent
                 Hughes)
           I believe Mr. Belfort just tried
           to bribe a federal officer.

                         JORDAN
           What? I was making conversation.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           Sounds like that to me, Jordan.

                         JORDAN
           ...no, no, no...

                         AGENT DENHAM
           ...sounded like that...

                         JORDAN
           ...no, to constitute a bribe,
           don't I have to make an explicit
           offer of money for services? With
           an exact dollar figure attached?
           All I said was "north" of half a
           million. According to the U.S.
           Criminal Code, that dog won't
           hunt, Pat.
                (then)
           Heard you were a straight arrow.
           That you wouldn't bend the rules
           other agents might. He was right.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           You did a background check on me?

                         JORDAN
           Figured you were looking into me,
           was only fair. Plus you sail on a
           yacht fit for a Bond villain,
           sometimes you gotta act the part.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           This is why you invited me down to
           your yacht? With a couple hookers
           on it --

                         JORDAN
           -- those are friends --

                         AGENT DENHAM
           -- to get a sense of the guy who
           was coming after you?

Jordan puts his hands up: "you got me."

                         JORDAN
           Thanks for coming down. Now get
           off my boat.

                         AGENT DENHAM
           You know, most of the Wall Street
           jackasses I bust, they were born
           to the life.
                                                                79.

                               AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D)
                 Their father was a douchebag
                 before them, and his father before
                 that. But you, you got this way
                 all on your own. Good for you,
                 Jordan.
                      (as he starts to go)
                 Thank you for having us. I'm
                 absolutely certain we'll see each
                 other again.
                      (before he does)
                 You know, this is about the nicest
                 boat I've ever been on. Just think
                 what a hero I'll be in the office
                 when the bureau seizes it.

      Jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can't let
      Denham get the final word. He calls after them:

                               JORDAN
                 Hey, Denham! I'm gonna eat a claw
                 of lobster now as I get my cock
                 sucked by Heidi down below. You
                 have a super ride home on the
                 subway thinking about that!                          *

      As he watches them pull away, seething --

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                 He was a numbers guy, a follow-the-
                 fucking-money'er. He wasn't gonna
                 come at me through my guys,
                 looking for a weak link and a
                 quick kill. He was gonna come at
                 me like an accountant would, the
                 way Ness got Capone, through my
                 books. Which meant? It was ass-
                 covering time.


138   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY      (SUMMER `95)   138

      As Naomi looks on, 5 months pregnant, Jordan packs a
      suitcase.

                                 NAOMI
                 Switzerland?    What the fuck is in
                 Switzerland?

                                JORDAN
                 Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you
                 fucking think?


139   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY               *139
      (SUMMER `95)

      Jordan sits talking with Rugrat and Donnie.
                                                               80.
       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Rugrat set up a meeting with a
                 Swiss Banker he knew from law
                 school who could launder our
                 money, but it wasn't till noon
                 the next day.

      Jordan glances at his watch, washes down a few ludes.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 I knew if I timed my lude intake
                 right, I'd sleep through the
                 entire overnight flight.


140   INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (SUMMER `95)         140

      Jordan stands before the Bullpen talking to his Brokers.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 At four p.m. I popped a few ludes,
                 which started kicking in by the
                 time I finished our sales meeting.
                 This was the tingle phase.


141   INT. CANASTEL'S - NIGHT    (SUMMER `95)                        141

      Over dinner, a visibly high Jordan ravenously digs into
      his food as Donnie and four Blue Chip Hookers look on.

                               JORDAN   (V.O.)
                 By dinner I popped a few more on
                 top of some cocktails and an
                 valium or two. The slur phase.


142   INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT    (SUMMER `95)                        142

      On the crowded dance floor, Jordan gets knocked around
      like a marionette, saliva strung from his mouth.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 By eight thirty I'd done a few
                 more and pretty much lost my motor
                 skills. This was the drool phase.


143   INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT (SUMMER `95)                          143

      Jordan is barely conscious as a Hooker rides him.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 And by ten I didn't know who or
                 what I was doing -- the amnesia
                 phase. We boarded the plane just
                 before midnight.
                                                               81.
       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

144   INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - NIGHT (SUMMER `95)        *144

      Jordan boards, slurring, drooling, completely wasted.

                               JORDAN
                      (to a Stewardess)
                 Sweetheart! Look at you!

      And as he hugs her, then stumbles toward his seat...


145   INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER `95)          *145

      Quiet; morning sunlight bleeds through the window.
      Jordan's eyes flicker open. He yawns, looks around,
      tries to get up; he can't move. He looks down, sees
      six seat belts restraining his arms and legs. Jordan
      looks over at Donnie, mouth agape, asleep next to him.

                                JORDAN
                 Donnie.   Donnie, wake up.

                                 DONNIE
                 Nuuhh?

                               JORDAN
                 Untie me, shitbag. You think this
                 is funny?

                               DONNIE
                 I didn't tie you, the captain did.
                 He almost tasered you.

                                 JORDAN
                 Why?


146   FLASHBACK --                                                   146

      As PASSENGERS scream, Jordan wildly humps a STEWARDESS,
      the CAPTAIN struggling to restrain him.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 This was fucking great. I hadn't
                 laundered a dime yet and already
                 I was under arrest.


147   INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER `95)          *147

      A pensive Jordan sits, mind racing.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Worse yet was the plastic baggie
                 of ludes that Donnie'd stuffed up
                 his ass.
                                                                82.
        The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

       Jordan trades looks with Donnie, who shifts
       uncomfortably.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  But before he could even get a
                  hemorrhoid--


147A   INT. GENEVA AIRPORT - CUSTOMS OFFICE - DAY                     147A
                                                                      *

       Jordan sits with two CUSTOMS OFFICERS.                         *

                                JORDAN (V.O.)                         *
                  --the whole thing was quashed by                    *
                  our friend the Swiss banker. Which                  *
                  was lucky for me, since so far I'd                  *
                  been able to keep Agent Fuckface                    *
                  unaware of the trip.                                *

       Another CUSTOMS OFFICER enters, whispers something to the      *
       others. They shake Jordan's hand and he leaves.                *


148    EXT. GENEVA - SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY (SUMMER `95)             148

       A limo pulls up at an office building.      Jordan emerges
       with Rugrat and Donnie.                                        *


149    INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - LOBBY - DAY (SUMMER `95)          149

       JEAN-JACQUES SAUREL greets them. 30s, suave. The lobby is
       ultra-modernist.

                                SAUREL
                  Jordan Belfort! At last!
                  Nicholas has told me so much.

                                RUGRAT
                  Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel.

                                JORDAN
                  Nice to make your acquaintance.
                  This is some lobby you got.

                                SAUREL
                  Ah, yes. We gave our designer an
                  unlimited budget and he exceeded
                  it. Come! You must tell me all
                  about your adventure with the

151   INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAUREL'S OFFICE - DAY               151

      Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and
      one other SWISS BANKER. It's an impressive office, with          *
      an enormous fish tank.

                               DONNIE
                 We have a joke in America.
                 "Heaven is a place where the
                 police are Brits, the chefs are
                 Italian, the car mechanics are
                 German, the prostitutes are French
                 and the bankers are Swiss." I
                 never got it `til now -- look at
                 those fucking fish! Come here,
                 little guy...

                               SAUREL
                 Yes, we have the same joke here.
                 Only sometimes the English are
                 chauffeurs and the chefs are
                 French. The Germans, alas, are
                 always mechanics; no one wants to
                 grant them more authority than
                 that.

      Polite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish,
      cuts straight to the point:


                               JORDAN
                 I'm curious about your bank
                 secrecy laws.

                               SAUREL
                 Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom
                 requires ten minutes of idle chit-
                 chat before business can be
                 discussed.
                      (a smile)
                 Of course, let's get "down to it."
                 What would you like to know?

                                JORDAN
                 Under what circumstances would you
                 be obligated to cooperate with an
                 FBI or U.S. Justice Department
                 investigation?

                                   SAUREL
                 Ca depend.

                                   JORDAN
                 Ca depend?      Ca depend on what?
                                                          84.
 The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                         SAUREL
           Whether America plans to invade
           Switzerland in the coming months.

                         RUGRAT
           Want me to see if tanks are
           rolling down the Rue de la Croix?

More chuckles.   Through Jordan's forced smile:

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
           is are you going to fuck me over.

                         SAUREL (V.O.)
           I understand perfectly, you
           American shitheel.

Saurel smiles.

                         SAUREL
           The only way the Banque Real de
           Geneve would cooperate with a
           foreign legal body is if the crime
           being pursued also happened to be
           a crime in Switzerland. But there
           are very few Swiss laws pertaining
           to your "rumored" improprieties.
           Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is
           most appropriate: from a financial
           standpoint you are now in heaven,
           and we welcome you. If the U.S.
           Justice Department or FBI or SEC
           or IRS sent us a subpoena, it
           would become papier-toillette. We
           would wipe our ass with it.

Everyone's impressed.      Except Jordan.

                         JORDAN
           Unless it was an investigation
           into stock fraud -- which is a
           crime in Switzerland. Then you'd
           have to cooperate.

                         SAUREL
                (now he's impressed)
           Yes, we would. Assuming the
           account is under your name.
           However, if it were in the name of
           a nominee of yours...

They take each other in.
                                                                 85.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Was that yodeling I just heard or
                 did you just say what I thought
                 you said?

                                   SAUREL (V.O.)
                 Yes!   Yes!

      As the meeting wraps up with handshakes, Jordan's V.O.
      overwhelms Saurel's V.O..

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 He was telling me to use a
                 rathole. Problem was: sneaking a
                 U.S. rathole into Switzerland was
                 a chance I couldn't take. What I
                 needed was somebody with a
                 European passport.

      Naomi's Aunt Emma answers the door.

                 Jordan?

                      (big smile, sweating)
                 Surprise.

      Amid towering trees and horse trails, a noticeably
      twitchy Jordan walks arm-in-arm with Aunt Emma.

                               AUNT EMMA
                 So tell me about this plan of
                 yours.

                               JORDAN
                 I'd like us to go to Switzerland
                 tomorrow so you can open an
                 account. I'll fund it, and I'll
                 pay you really well for your
                 trouble.

                                   AUNT EMMA

                         JORDAN
           Next month maybe you can fly to
           New York and we can start moving
           the cash.

                         AUNT EMMA
           Moving the cash.
                (smiles)
           I feel like a character in an
           Ian Fleming novel. It's all quite
           racy, isn't it?

                         JORDAN
           It is, and it's illegal too. Of
           course if you ever got in trouble,
           I'd come forward in two seconds,
           say I duped you, but even still.

                         AUNT EMMA
           Risk is what keeps us young, isn't
           it darling?

                          JORDAN
           I like that attitude. Promise me                      *
           you'll spend at least ten thousand
           pounds per month out of the
           account, okay?

                         AUNT EMMA
                (chuckles)
           I wouldn't even know how. I
           really do have everything I need.

                         JORDAN
           But I bet you don't have
           everything you want. How about a
           bigger apartment so your grandkids
           can sleep over?

Aunt Emma notices that Jordan is sweating, fidgety.       He's
jonesing.

                           AUNT EMMA
           Shall we sit?

                         JORDAN
           Sure, that'd be great.

They sit on a nearby bench.     After a while:

                         AUNT EMMA
           Sometimes I wonder if you let
           money get the best of you, dear.
                (beat)
           Among other substances.

           Well there are worse things to be
           addicted to than sex.

                         JORDAN
                (chuckles; then)
           Why did I just tell you that?                         *

                (playful)
           Because I'm very easy to talk to.

Jordan looks at her.       A few beats, then:

                         JORDAN
           As a matter of fact you are. My                       *

           I've bitten off more than I can                       *
           chew.                                                 *

                         AUNT EMMA
           You're a man with large appetites.

Jordan looks at her and smiles:

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           Is she fucking hitting on me?

                         JORDAN
           I agree. I put it on myself. It's                     *
           hard to control the anxiety, you                      *
           know? It's hard to learn to relax.                    *

                         AUNT EMMA
           To release the tension.

Jordan leans in closer, casually slips an arm around her.

                  racked my brain for another person
                  with a foreign passport.

       The bed's covered with bundles of cash. Every thrust of
       Jordan's, another bundle plummets to the floor -- thunk.

                 We'll get her parents to tape up
                 too. They got Swiss passports.
                 Plus her brother and his wife.

                 probably do it just for the miles.

           And you can come "pick it up."

Brad asks Jordan if they can speak in private.

MOMENTS LATER, IN PRIVATE: Jordan joins Brad.

                           JORDAN
           What's wrong?

           I dunno if he's stupid or a junkie
           but he's a loose fuckin' cannon.
           I don't trust him and I don't want
           him around me.

           Jesus. I thought he was your best
           customer.

                         JORDAN
           Can you just do one trip for him?

Brad stews.   It's asking a lot.

                         BRAD
           I'll meet him but I won't pick up.

        Donnie emerges from where he's been eavesdropping.

                                 DONNIE (CONT'D)
                   I'm a douchebag?!! Well, whose

       Brad waits by his Range Rover as Donnie's Rolls careens
       into the lot. He emerges, briefcase in hand.

                                    DONNIE
                  Fu Manchu!      Kung fu!

       Donnie starts doing spastic karate moves. Is he high?
       Sure looks like it. Brad looks pissed, and Donnie starts
       laughing. Actually he's dead sober.

                                DONNIE (CONT'D)

                  have to dress like a mall rat
                  guinea prison bitch all the time.

       Donnie grins, obviously still smarting from Brad's slap.
       Brad just wants to take the money and be done.

                                BRAD
                  Give me the money.

       A DISTANCE AWAY, a COP in a patrol car notices Brad
       gesturing to Donnie for his briefcase. He nudges his
       partner: check this out.

                  your Slavic cunt's pussy.

       That does it. Brad attacks. Donnie throws the case at
       him, which opens on impact, money spilling out. Brad
       instinctively tries to contain it... and that's when the
       POLICE SIRENS start. Here comes the patrol car.

       Donnie bolts. With no time to get to his car, Brad takes
       off on foot, bleeding briefcase in hand, toward a video
       store where he stashes his .38 in the return box.

                  Freeze!   Don't move!

       Brad drops to his knees, briefcase at his feet. From a

       arrested, knowing he fucked this up.

                 Why, what's--

                               BO DIETL
                 Leave the house, call me back
                 from a pay phone, you hear me?


185   EXT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER `95)                 185

      Jordan pulls his Lamborghini out of the driveway.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The Brookville Country Club was a
                 WASP stronghold, a straight shot
                 down the road from my house.


186   EXT. BROOKVILLE COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT      (LATE SUMMER `95)    186

      Jordan pulls up, exits the car in sweats, flip-flops and
      a T-shirt. He hustles up a staircase into...


187   INT. BROOKVILLE COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT      (LATE SUMMER `95)    187

      Jordan stands at a pay phone, receiver to his ear.
      WE HEAR it ringing, then:

                                 BO DIETL (O.S.)
                 Jordan?
                                                                   97.

                               JORDAN
                 Yeah, I'm at a pay phone.       What's
                 going on?

                                                               INTERCUT:


188   INT. BO DIETL'S CADILLAC - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER `95)                   188

      Bo talks on his cell.

                               BO DIETL
                 Your buddy Brad's in jail.

                               JORDAN
                 Oh, Jesus Christ! What did he do?                         *


                               BO DIETL

                 But listen to me. More important
                 than that. The guy Denham I told
                 you about, the Fed? He's got your
                 phones tapped, I'm pretty sure.

                 But, listen to me. Do me a favor,                         *
                 please do not talk on the phone.                          *

                                   JORDAN
                 Fuck!

                               BO DIETL
                 Did you try to bribe this fuckin'
                 guy?

                                   JORDAN
                 What? No!       I didn't try to bribe
                 anybody!

                              BO DIETL
                 Jordan? I couldn't understand
                 you. Say that again?

                               JORDAN

        The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

       Jordan can't respond. Phone still to his ear, his
       eyelids droop. Drool spills from his slackened jaw.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  After fifteen years in storage,
                  the Lemmons had developed a
                  delayed fuse.

       JORDAN'S POV -- is hazy as he stares at his own
       reflection in the pay phone.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  It took 90 minutes for the little
                  fuckers to kick in, but once they
                  did -- pow! I had skipped the
                  tingle phase and went straight to
                  the drool phase.

       JORDAN'S POV -- the phone gets further and further away.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Actually I'd discovered a new
                  phase: the cerebral palsy phase.

       BAMMM!! Jordan hits the floor with a thud, crashed out
       on his back. From the dangling phone, we hear:

                                BO DIETL (O.S.)
                       (over phone)
                  Jordan! Jordan! Do not get behind
                  the wheel! Just tell me where
                  you're at, I'll send Rocco!

       Jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach
       for it; he can't. He lays there for a while, then:

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  C'mon, stand up!

       He rolls onto all fours, lifts a hand, topples over.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Okay, walking is off the list of
                  options. All right, what else is
                  there?
                       (a brainstorm)
                  I can crawl, like Skylar!

       Slowly, Jordan begins crawling like an infant to the top
       of the staircase.

189   EXT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER `95)                           189

      The Lamborghini is parked at the bottom, twenty steps
      down. He starts to crawl down the stairs, stops. Tries
      again. Can't figure out how to do it.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Fuck!   The kid makes it look so
                 easy!

      An icy wind blows through his T-shirt.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Think, you motherfucker, think!
                      (a few beats; then)
                 Wait, I've got it!

      Jordan slowly curls himself into a ball.

                                   JORDAN (V.O.)
                 I can roll!

      Forcing himself over the edge, Jordan begins to descend
      the steps, one at a time. Thump. Thump. Then faster.
      Thump- Thump-Thump. Faster still. He loses control,
      takes all the steps at once. Thump-Thump-Thump-Thump-
      Thump-Thump. He lands with a crash on the asphalt,
      drags himself up and into the Lamborghini.


190   INT. JORDAN'S LAMBORGHINI - NIGHT        (LATE SUMMER `95)         190

      Ignition on, Jordan sits hunched over, chin resting on
      the steering wheel. Just then, the car phone RINGS.
      With great effort, he pushes the speaker phone button:

                                   JORDAN
                 ...ello?

                                 NAOMI (O.S.)
                 Omigod!    Jordan, where are you?!

                                   JORDAN
                 Whazz a marra?

                               NAOMI (O.S.)
                 It's Donnie, he's totally out of
                 control! He's on the other line
                 with some Swiss guy!

      Jordan's face reads horror.

                                   JORDAN
                 Whaa?!!    No!!
                                                              100.
      The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                               NAOMI (O.S.)
                 I can't understand you! Just get
                 home, hurry!

      Naomi clicks off.    And as Jordan puts the car in gear...

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 They say God protects drunks and
                 babies. I was praying the same
                 held true for drug addicts.


191   EXT. HEGEMAN'S ROAD - NIGHT     (LATE SUMMER `95)              191

      Peering over the wheel like an old lady, Jordan slowly
      maneuvers the Lamborghini down the dark road.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 I was less than a mile from home
                 and drove slower than shit.


192   EXT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - NIGHT     (LATE SUMMER 95)              192

      Jordan pulls up in the Lamborghini, shuts the ignition.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Somehow I made it alive, not a
                 scratch on me or the car.


193   INT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER `95) 193

      CLOSE ON the TV, where a POPEYE cartoon is playing.
      PULL BACK to reveal Skylar watching. As Jordan staggers
      in, Naomi approaches...

                                  JORDAN
                 Where Zonnie?!

                               NAOMI
                 In the kitchen.

       (LATE SUMMER `95)

       Having been just woken up, Jean-Jacques Saurel sits up in
       bed, phone to his ear, a perplexed look on his face.

                                SAUREL
                  What language are you speaking,

       With Naomi looking on, Jordan staggers toward Donnie
       like a drunk Frankenstein.

                                   JORDAN
                  Ge ozza zone!     Ge ozza iz!!

                                   JORDAN
                  GE OZZA ZONE!!

       With all the strength he can muster, Jordan RIPS the
       phone from the wall, throwing it skittering across the
       floor with a CLANG.

                                NAOMI
                  What the fuck are you doing?!

                  Wazza mazzer?! Wazza yoo razy?!!

       Skylar looks on from the next room, crying as Jordan
       tries to shake some sense into Donnie. Naomi crosses to         *
       Skylar and rushes her out of the room.                          *

           WUZZ?!

Fuck it. Jordan releases Donnie. Donnie crawls into the            *
dining room and starts shoving ham into his mouth in an            *
effort to sober up. Just then, we HEAR a horrible                  *
GAGGING sound. Donnie holds his throat as he falls                 *
backward choking, taking out the entire glass kitchen
table with a tremendous CRASH! Naomi rushes back in.               *

                         NAOMI
           Omigod, he's choking!     Jordan, do
           something!!

Just then, WE HEAR the triumphant Popeye FANFARE --
Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of
spinach down his gullet. Instantly, his chest and arm
muscles swell to five times their size.

Jordan goes to get his coke. He snarfs up two fat
spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he
takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue...

Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue.

                         NAOMI (CONT'D)
           He's not breathing!

Jordan places his fingers over Donnie's artery.         Nothing.

                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Save him!

Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnie's chest,
breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts.

                         JORDAN (V.O.)
           This stupid sonovabitch! All
           Donnie ever did was fuck me up and
           now I had to save his life `cause
           I took a CPR class when the baby
           was learning to swim. Just for
           the record, I want it noted: not
           for a second did I even think
           about letting him choke to death,
           even though it would've saved me
           an awful lot of headaches.

Donnie still isn't breathing. Jordan flips him over,
tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks
Donnie's ribs. He flips him back over, but he's almost
completely blue.
                                                                 103.
       The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                                JORDAN
                  He won't come back!

                                NAOMI
                  Don't let him die! He has
                  children!

       One last try. Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as
       hard as he can into Donnie's lungs. Donnie's stomach
       distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham
       projects from his mouth and into Jordan's face. Donnie

                  You're a lucky guy, Jordan.
                  Legally I've never seen anyone
                  slip a noose the way you do.
                  Christ, you're lucky to be alive
                  much less not in jail.

                                JORDAN

                  That's what all lucky people say.
                  It's time, Jordan. Let me make a

                  runs out.

                  on the sidelines, my guess is your

       (SPRING `96)

       The troops ROAR as Jordan takes center stage.

                                JORDAN
                  I'm sure many of you have been
                  hearing rumors lately, about me,
                  about the future of this firm, and
                  that's what I'd like to talk to
                  you about today.
                       (a few beats, then)
                  Five years ago when I started
                  Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew
                  the day would eventually come when
                  I'd be moving on. It's truly with
                  a heavy heart that I tell you that
                  day is here.

       The place erupts in a chorus of "No!", "Don't go!", etc.
       Jordan raises his hand for quiet.

                                JORDAN (CONT'D)
                  Thank you for that and for your
                  years of incredible loyalty and
                  admiration.
                                                        106.
The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           The point is though, that under
           Donnie's leadership, along with
           Robbie Feinberg and Nicky Koskoff
           moving into key management
           positions, this place is gonna be
           better than ever!

A smattering of applause. Jordan notices a few Brokers
gravely shaking their heads.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           And the fact that I'm gone won't
           stop me from giving Donnie advice,
           not that he needs any--

                         DONNIE
                (jumping in)
           Why would anyone in their right
           mind not follow JB's advice?

Donnie looks petrified; he's used to being an offensive
tackle, not the quarterback.

                         JORDAN
           Before I go, there's something I
           want to remind you all, and that's
           this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger
           than any one person, even me.
           Especially me. You guys are
           Stratton, each and every one of
           you, and that is why it's sure to
           remain the best brokerage firm in
           the fucking world!

Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all
300 Brokers on their feet. WE PUSH IN on Jordan.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           See, the very idea of Stratton is
           that when you come here and step
           into this bullpen for the first
           time, you start your life anew.
           You have a place here and no one
           can take that away from you!
           Stratton Oakmont is America! Give
           me your tired and poor! The very
           moment you walk through that door
           and pledge your loyalty to this
           firm, you become part of a family,
           you become a Strattonite! It
           doesn't matter who you are, it
           doesn't matter where you're from!
           Whether your family came over on
           the Mayflower or on a fucking
           inner tube from Haiti!
                                                          107.

More applause. Jordan scans the young faces -- they
worship him. In the crowd he finds KIMMIE BELZER, 30s.

                          JORDAN (CONT'D)
           Everybody here knows Kimmie
           Belzer, right?

Hoots and hollers...      He raises his hand for quiet.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           In case any of you weren't aware
           of it, Kimmie was one of
           Stratton's first brokers, one of
           the original twenty. Now when
           most of you met Kimmie, you met
           her the way she is today -- a
           beautiful woman who drives a brand
           new Mercedes, a woman who lives in
           the finest condo complex on Long
           Island. A woman who wears $3000
           Armani suits, who spends her
           winters in the Bahamas and her
           summers in the Hamptons!

Wild applause.

                         JORDAN (CONT'D)
           But that's not the Kimmie I met.
           The Kimmie I met was broke, a
           single mom on the balls of her
           ass. Three months behind on her
           rent with an eight year old son!
           She came to me for a job and when
           I hired her she asked for a $5000
           dollar advance so she could pay
           his tuition. And what did I do,
           Kimmie?

                         KIMMIE
           You wrote me a check for $25,000!

                         JORDAN
           Because I believed in you, like
           I believe in each and every one
           of you!

                         KIMMIE
           I love you, Jordan!

As the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the
adoration. He looks at Donnie, turns back to the Crowd,
looks out at the faces. A change has come over him.
He stands there, thinking. An eternity, then:
                                                                108.
        The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

                                 JORDAN
                   You know for years I've been
                   telling you guys not to take no
                   for an answer, to keep pushing,
                   to not hang up the phone till you
                   get what you want. This deal I'm
                   about to sign, barring me from the
                   securities industry, barring me
                   from Stratton, my home... What the
                   fuck is that? I'll tell you what
                   it is, it's me being a hypocrite.
                   It's me taking no for an answer,
                   it's them selling me, not the
                   other way around! Fuck it, I'm
                   not leaving!

        Jordan smiles, thrusts his hands in the air --

                                 JORDAN (CONT'D)
                   THE SHOW GOES ON!!

        The place goes absolutely INSANE. And as Donnie and Max

                  way to transport it overseas.

       ON ANOTHER BAG, this one brimming with bottles of pills,
       bags of pot, vials of coke. Jordan and Donnie cut up
       lines as a HOSTESS serves Bloody Marys.

       Donnie are doing a "you first, no, you first" routine
       with a rolled up $100 when a CELL rings. Donnie grabs

                  Not to worry, Jordan. Your aunt,
                  before she died, signed a document

209   EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - NIGHT      (SUMMER `96)                209

      The perfect storm. As the Naomi tips at a 45-degree
      angle, a thick wall of gray water comes rising over her
      side, slamming onto the bridge with a thunderous CRASH.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)

      Six Jet Skis plummet off the deck into the raging sea.

       Jordan grabs Naomi. All at once the boat dips down at an        *
       impossibly steep angle, until it's pointing almost              *
       straight down. Captain Ted jams the throttle and the            *
       boat jerks forward, rising up the face of a giant rogue         *
       wave, which curls over the top of the bridge and...             *

       KABOOM! -- Blackness. Slowly, painfully, the boat pops          *
       up from beneath the water, its helicopter RIPPING from          *
       the deck and crashing into the sea.                             *

211   INT. ITALIAN NAVAL DESTROYER - BELOW DECK - NIGHT                   *211
      (SUMMER `96)

      Off to the side, Jordan watches as Naomi, their Friends,
      and the yacht's Crew Members dance to blaring techno
      music. A small group of Italian SAILORS cheer them on.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 The nice thing about getting
                 rescued by Italians is that the
                 first thing they do is feed you
                 and make you drink red wine.
                 Then they make you dance.

      Jordan watches as the dancing continues, then casually
      glances out a porthole, where WE SEE the distant lights
      of a PLANE making its way across the night sky. After a
      few beats, the plane EXPLODES, a tiny flash of light.

                               JORDAN (V.O.)
                 Did you see that? That was the
                 plane I sent for to come get us.
                 I shit you not, it exploded when
                 a seagull flew into the engine,
                 three people killed. You want a
                 sign from God, well after all this
                 I finally got the message. I had
                 to make some fucking changes.

                                                              FADE OUT.

       Shot on 90's-era video, an ad intended for late-night
       local tv. The defining idea here is that while the
       commercial may be amateurish, Jordan isn't; he's an
       excellent salesman even if the ad is cut-rate.

                    The first action you have to take
                    is to DECIDE to be wealthy. When

                    DECISION not to just survive but
                    to THRIVE. I started my own stock

                    attending Jordan Belfort's, um,

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  This one takes the cake. It was
                  Rugrat, he'd been busted down in
                  Miami, and guess who the fuck
                  with?

                  be ten thousand Swiss bankers in

                  Even more ironic was he'd gotten
                  himself indicted on charges that
                  had nothing to fucking do with me.

       dices shrimp on a sizzling grill.

                  of fucking Hibachi Restaurants to
                  bring me down?


222    INT. SAUREL'S BEDROOM - DAY (OCT `95)                          222

       Saurel lays on the bed, smoking.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Long story short was Saurel ratted
                  me out, but not before he ratted
                  out Chantalle, who it turns out
                  he'd been fucking every time she
                  went to Switzerland!

       Chantalle emerges from the bathroom naked.     Laughing, she
       runs and jumps in bed with Saurel.

       Jordan exits the building. He's fucked and he knows it.
       He sees beautiful Naomi waiting for him beside a
       limosine; life isn't totally hopeless. He approaches.

                                JORDAN
                  Nay, thank God. I'm so glad
                  you're here.

       They embrace. He can't see her expression: she'd rather
       be anywhere else.

      ON SKYLAR AND PARKER, playing with a NANNY and Rocky the
      dog. Jordan watches them, sitting by his pool, drinking
      an O'Douls, weighing his options.

      Donnie pops into the yard, in "Uncle Donnie" mode.

                               DONNIE
                 Hey, everybody! How're the
                 happiest people in Long Island?
                 Hi, Rocky!!
                      (joining Jordan)
                 Hate that fucking dog.

                               JORDAN
                 Tell me about it. It's getting
                 old, starting to shit inside the
                 house again.

      Jordan offers Donnie an O'Douls; Donnie declines.

                               DONNIE
                 How you doing, brother?     How was
                 the food in jail?

                               JORDAN
                 Lobster Newburg sucked.     They gave
                 me some jewelry though.

      He shows off the electronic bracelet around his ankle.

                                DONNIE
                 Wonder if they got one in my size.
                 Fuckin' Rugrat, that wig-wearin'
                 hump. Tell you one thing: I'm
                 never eating at Benihana's again.
                 Where's Naomi?

                                 JORDAN
                 Inside.    Pissed.

      Donnie sees Naomi in a window.      He waves but she barely
      registers him.

                               DONNIE
                 What's up her ass?

                               JORDAN
                 Had to mortgage the home to make
                 bail. Probably gonna hafta sell
                 it to pay my lawyers. If we fight
                 this thing.

      Donnie weighs that.
                                                               124.

                  The Feds say anything about coming
                  after the rest of us?

       Jordan thinks, then shakes his head no.

                                DONNIE (CONT'D)
                  You know, we're all behind you.
                  Everyone at the office.
                       (he removes an
                        envelope, hands it
                        to Jordan)
                  We bought back your mortgage. All
                  the founding partners threw in a
                  million apiece. Figured none of
                  us would have it if it weren't for
                  you.

       Jordan's profoundly touched. Donnie squeezes his
       shoulder. A real moment of friendship.

                                DONNIE (CONT'D)
                  You gotta fight this thing, baby.

       Jordan nods.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  Like I said, loyalty meant a lot
                  to me. Without your friends and
                  family standing behind you, you're
                  fucked.

           Baby, I talked to the lawyers                       *
           again today. I have some really                     *
           great news. As it turns out you're                  *
           totally off the hook.                               *

                         NAOMI                                 *
           I know that already.                                *

                         JORDAN                                *
           You never did anything wrong                        *
           anyway, right? At the end of the                    *
           day all they really want is for me                  *
           to cooperate - that's it.                           *
           See, apparently, I know so much                     *
           about what's going on in the stock                  *
           market that I could save the                        *
           government years of heartache. But                  *
           it get's even better... You see,                    *
           if I cooperate I'll only have to                    *
           serve four short years and any                      *
           fine I'd have to pay wouldn't be                    *
           due til after I serve my sentence.                  *
           We'll still have plenty of money                    *
           left over. The only thing that I                    *
           was kind of upset about was the                     *
           fact that I might have to give                      *
           them information about my friends.                  *

                         NAOMI                                 *
           Like you said, "There's no friends                  *
           on Wall Street".                                    *

                         JORDAN                                *
           But there's a silver lining to                      *
           that too... It turns out that all                   *
           of `em are probably gonna                           *
           cooperate too. So in the end, that                  *
           won't really be a factor.                           *

                         NAOMI                                 *
           Well, that's really good news,                      *
           honey. I'm really happy for you.                    *

           No, it's good for both of us, Nay.                  *

                         JORDAN                                *
           Make love to me baby. Make love to                  *
           me nice and slow.                                   *

           haven't for a long time.                            *

           You don't love me? Isn't that                       *
           convenient. Now, you don't love                     *

           You married me. This is how it's                    *
           gonna be. Listen Jordan. I'm                        *
           taking custody of the kids. If you                  *
           agree to the divorce right now, I                   *
           will allow you visitation. Don't                    *

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  For the next six hours, I came up
                  with a list. Friends, enemies,
                  business associates, anybody who'd
                  ever known me or taken so much as
                  a stock tip. The first name on
                  the list was Donnie's.

       And as Jordan heaves a huge sigh, we're suddenly...

       where the Brokers spot him, giving him a standing
       ovation. He forces a smile, waves to the crowd.

       As Robbie and Chester Ming look on, Jordan forces a smile
       as he approaches Donnie, who gives him a hug.

      Jordan and Donnie sit at the coffee table over takeout
      sushi.

                               JORDAN
                 The trial won't be for months,
                 so obviously I'll be counting on
                 you to pick up the slack.

                               DONNIE
                 Whatever you need, bro.     You know
                 that.

      Jordan reaches in his jacket for a yellow slip of PAPER.

                               JORDAN
                 And you know how much that means
                 to me. Hey, you know what I
                 wanted to ask you?

      Jordan catches Donnie's eye, pushes the PAPER over in
      front of him.

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)
                 The Steve Madden deal, did he
                 ever come through on that?

      Donnie looks down at the paper, reads Jordan's writing:

       "DON'T INCRIMINATE YOURSELF.      I'M WEARING A WIRE."

                               JORDAN (CONT'D)
                 Remember he was supposed to kick
                 back like four mil from that one
                 account?

                               DONNIE
                 Uh... tell you the truth I was so
                 fucked up, I don't really remember
                 anything about that.

      Donnie slips the paper in his jacket, gives Jordan a
      look -- "Thank you." Jordan nods.

                               JORDAN
                 Well if you talk to him, let me
                 know. You want the last
                 yellowtail?

                 Why not?

                 And thus began my career as a

       Jordan lays alone, asleep in bed.      We hear the DOORBELL.

                                JORDAN (V.O.)
                  But I wasn't losing any sleep
                  over it.

       After a few beats, Violet knocks, enters.      Jordan stirs.

                                VIOLET
                  I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan.     You got a

                  Why?   What's going on?

                  You're going to jail.

       Agent Denham holds up the slip of yellow paper that
       Jordan gave to Donnie. And on Jordan's look...

                 I'm not ashamed to admit, when we

                 Sorry, just out. What is that,
                 forty-thirty?

               as a motivational speaker.                        *

When the applause finally dies down...                           *

...Jordan doesn't speak. Instead he walks down to the            *
front row of his audience, studying faces. He picks one.         *
Takes a pen from his coat and offers it to him.                  *

		grow faint, then disappear altogether.'

	As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, 
	perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE 
	BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:

	WELCOME TO WORDFEST

	GRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if

		So. .Anyone?

	A GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN

	LEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the

		Let me get this straight. The girl with the

		to her mother working this guy in the next 
		room, she has to wash the sheets each morning 
		before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of 
		this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy 
		takes her to confession--only, once she gets in 
		the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and 
		realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is 
		that it?

	James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY 
	OVERCOAT he wears.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?

					GRADY
		All right. Let's try to keep it constructive, 
		shall we? Howard, what about you?

					HOWARD 
		I hated it.

					GRADY
		That's not exactly what I meant by 
		constructive, Howard.

					HOWARD 
		I think James should try to be more 
		constructive. This is my second semester with 
		him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me 
		want to kill myself.

	GRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. 
	Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the 
	raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN. 

					GRADY
		Yes, Hannah?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I think maybe we're missing the point. It 
		seems to me James' strength as a writer is that 
		he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us 
		like adults. He respects us enough to forget 
		us. That takes . . . courage .

	GRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.

					GRADY
		Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I 
		think. 
			(as the students rise) 
		Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And 
		remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to 
		tonight's cocktail party need to have them at 
		the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.

	Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.

					GRADY
		Thanks for that. He all right?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I think so. ..What about you?

					GRADY
		Me? Sure. Why?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Just checking.

	GRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY 
	BOOTS, then starts to exit himself. 

					JAMES LEER 
		Turn out the light, please.

	GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back 
	of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the 
	wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.

2	INT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 

	GRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL, 
	45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful 
	of SLICK PROGRAMS.

					SARA 
			(calm but firm) 
		No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for 
		today. This means we have no programs for the 
		weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at 
		9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw 
		Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are 
		going. 
			(shaking her head) 
		It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.

	GRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. 
	There is the slightest of hesitations, then....

					SARA 
		Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
		Chancellor.

					SARA 
		I got the message you called.

					GRADY
		I got the message you called too.

	This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and 
	continue on, without so much as a backward glance. 

3	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING

	The RADIO BLASTS as GRADY pops the glove box, removes a 
	JOINT as big as his pinky, and wheels his DARK MAROON '66 
	GALAXIE RAGTOP away from campus, cruising under another 
	BANNER:

	WELCOME TO WORDFEST FEBRUARY 26-28

4	EXT. GALAXIE - MOVING.. - PITTSBURGH 

	GRADY cruises past the three rivers and modest 
	skyscrapers of downtown, sipping at the weed. 

5	INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

	GRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half 
	the length of the terminal, until...

6	INT. ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

	...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the 
	tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black 
	dress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels.  
	Grinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the 
	woman's ear, then spots Grady.

					CRABTREE 
		Tripp!

					GRADY
		How are you, Crabtree?

					CRABTREE 
		Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss 
		Antonia. . .uh. . . .

					WOMAN 
		Sloviak.

					CRABTREE 
		I took the liberty of inviting Antonia to 
		tonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you. 
		Trip? ?

					GRADY
			(a slight beat) 
		The more the merrier.

					MISS SLOVIAK 
		Terry was telling me about you on the plane. 
		It was ail so interesting.

					CRABTREE 
		I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes 
		to be published. What you do as a writer, what 
		I do as an editor...

					GRADY
		I sweat blood for five years and he checks for 
		spelling.

					MISS SLOVIAK 
			(indicating Crabtree) 
		That's exactly what he said.

					CRABTREE 
		We know each other pretty well. 
			(to Grady) 
		So where's Emily?

					GRADY
		Emily?

					CRABTREE 
		Your wife.

					GRADY
		Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.

					CRABTREE 
		Perfect. Well then, shall we?

	GRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the 
	architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in 
	her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.

7	INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak 
	sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.

					CRABTREE 
		Do you know how many times I've boarded an 
		airplane praying someone like her would sit 
		down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my 
		way to Pittsburgh.

					GRADY
		Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great 
		cities.

					CRABTREE 
		If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no 
		argument from me.

					GRADY
		She's a transvestite.

					CRABTREE 
		You're stoned.

					GRADY
		She's still a transvestite.

					CRABTREE 
		Mm.

					GRADY
		Isn't she?

	Crabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he 
	watches the carousel spin.

					CRABTREE 
		So how's the book?

	GRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so 
	soon. He tries to act casual.

					GRADY
		It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort 
		of. ..tinkering with it.

					CRABTREE 
		Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it 
		sometime this weekend. Think that might be 
		possible?

					GRADY
		I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . . 
		juncture .

					CRABTREE
		I thought you were tinkering.

					GRADY
		I just mean. . .

					CRABTREE
		Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, 
		Tripp. But...
			(pointedly)
		 ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?

	GRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's 
	face brightens again.

					CRABTREE
		Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that would 
		be?

	GRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto 
	the carousel.

					GRADY
		That would be a tuba.

8	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                8

	As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the 
	great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, 
	then glances in the rearview mirror.

					GRADY
		That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It 
		wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Why yes. How did you know?

					GRADY
		Lucky guess.

					CRABTREE
		You didn't actually purchase this car, did 
		you. Trip??

					GRADY
		It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.

					CRABTREE 
		He owes God money. You know, he queered 
		himself for good with Esquire.

	GRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto 
	butane.

					GRADY
		He said something about being between things.

					CRABTREE
		Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken 
		legs.

9	EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER  

	A YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS 
	UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in 
	front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her 
	face. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger 
	window.

					GRADY
		Hi, Tanya. 
			(to the others) 
		This is Tanya. My wife's secretary.

	CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and 
	nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.

					TANYA 
		Grady.. ..Emily's not here.

	GRADY just smiles, nods.

					TANYA (cont'd) 
		Is there anything I can do for you?

	GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through 
	Tanya's sad umbrella.

					GRADY
		You're leaking, Tanya.

	Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.

					CRABTREE
		Trip? ?

					GRADY
		She left me. Crabs.

					CRABTREE
		Left you...?  Who? Emily?

					GRADY
		This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

					CRABTREE
		But. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I 
		mean, what are we doing here?

	GRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his 
	windshield, turns on the ignition.

					GRADY
		I thought maybe I made it all up.

10	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING 

	Through the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and 
	select students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of 
	cigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching 
	halt across the street, parks in front of another fire 
	hydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a 
	GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		That's a nice greenhouse.

					GRADY
		It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.

					CRABTREE
		I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, 
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.

					CRABTREE
		Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always 
		do.

11	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE  

	As the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears, 
	riding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch.

					SARA 
		Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you 
		again. 

					CRABTREE
		Chancellor. Don't you look ravishing.

					SARA
		Aren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to 
		wonder if you were ever going to--oh!

	As Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches 
	forward ...into Grady's arms.

					GRADY
		Easy there.

					SARA
		I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't 
		know how anyone actually walks in these things.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Practice.

	Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific 
	curiosity in her eye.

					SARA
		I don't believe we've met...

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Antonia. Antonia Sloviak--

	Just then, a THICKLY-MUCSCLED DOG with very strange EYES 
	skitters around the corner, BARKING SAVAGELY in the general 
	direction of Grady.

					SARA
		Poe!

					CRABTREE
			(mildly)
		This wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it?

	Poe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the 
	hardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around 
	and is barking at the living room.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Who ' s he barking at now?

					GRADY
		He's still barking at me. He's blind.

					SARA
		Poe' Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.

	As Poe simmers to a deep growl, GRADY leans forward.

					GRADY
		I need to talk to you.

					SARA
		That's funny. I need to talk to you, too. 
			(strategy in her tone)
		Perhaps you could put some of these coats in 
		the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
			(reading her)
		I don't believe I know where the upstairs 
		guest room is.

					SARA
		Well then. I'd better show you. Terry--

					CRABTREE
		We'll just make ourselves at home.
			(kneeling by Poe) 
		Won't we, Poe? Yes, yes....

12	INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM 

	GRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA. 
	AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of 
	famous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN 
	IN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with 
	PITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. As 
	Sara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S 
	PENNANT hanging over the mantle.

					GRADY
		New?

					SARA 
			(nodding)
		Walter just got it back from the framer today.

	Sara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the 
	pennant and down onto the coat-covered bed.

					SARA 
		You go first.

					GRADY
		All right. This morning--

					SARA 
		I'm pregnant.

	A flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living  room below. 
	GRADY starts to speak.

					SARA 
		I'm sure.

					GRADY
		Well. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?

					SARA
		I think Walter would find this a little more 
		than surprising.

	GRADY nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back.

					GRADY
		Emily left me this morning.

					SARA
		She's left before...

					GRADY
		She's left the room before. She always came 
		back.

	Sara nods. Considers this.

					SARA
		So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry 
		each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.

					GRADY
		Simple.

	GRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling. Sara sniffs the coat 
	lying beneath her. Miss Sloviak's coat.

					SARA
		Is that Cristaile?

					GRADY
		Hm.

					SARA 
			(weary)
		My God, I wear the same scent as a 
		transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: 
		she?

					GRADY
		If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is 
		by the end of the evening.

					SARA
		Has he asked to see the book yet?

					GRADY
		Yes.

					SARA
		And? Are you going to tell him?

					GRADY
		No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm 
		going to do.

					SARA 
			(distantly) 
		Neither do 1.

	GRADY starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara.

					GRADY
		Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.

					SARA
		I guess you're going to have to chew it off 
		then.

13	INT. LIVING ROOM - GASKELL HOUSE   

	Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by 
	Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree, 
	returning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds 
	MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's.

					CRABTREE
		Walter! I see you've met my friend.

					WALTER GASKELL 
		Yes . She' s charming.

					MISS SLOVIAK
			(taking her drink)
		Walter's been telling me the most fascinating 
		things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?

					WALTER GASKELL
		Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my 
		contention that their marriage tapped into the 
		very id of American popular culture. Joe 
		DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, 
		the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be 
		controversial, I personally believe every 
		woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn 
		Monroe.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Oh, I couldn't agree more.

	NEW ANGLE

	GRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and 
	changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN 
	("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's 
	clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting 
	the make on Hannah Green.

					Q
		And while my latest has been on the New York 
		Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't 
		help but lament that my first book, which 
		contains what I consider my finest writing, was 
		remaindered in less than five. So, I find 
		myself conflicted.

					GRADY
		Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in 
		the Hamptons.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(brightening)
		Grady.

	Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass.

					Q 
		Hello.. .Professor.

					GRADY
		Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The 
		Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A' 
		material for her.

	As GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the 
	other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN 
	TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN.

					MAN IN TWEED 
			(to short man)
		A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm 
		telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob 
		laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa? 
		Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot 
		bookstore like they need another goddamn cow.
			(as GRADY passes) 
		Grady!

					GRADY
		Hello, Nathan.

					MAN IN TWEED
		My God, I haven't seen you since, what? The 
		PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for 
		you, Grady.
			(to his friend)
		GRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter,

	The short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand.

					SHORT MAN
		Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I 
		say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon 
		of late twentieth century fiction. I've had it 
		on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years 
		running.

					GRADY
			(pulling away) 
		No wonder it's still in print.

	As GRADY flees, he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette.

					WOMAN WITH CIGARETTE
		...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy 
		fucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to 
		deal with the sweater thing. They'll discover 
		the cancer in your heart every time, but God 
		forbid they find a decent dry cleaner.

14	EXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT   

	GRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from 
	his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around 
	the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE 
	accosts him.

					MAN'S VOICE 
		There you are.

	GRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he 
	sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the 
	person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in 
	the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.  

					WALTER
		I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in 
		here. You haven't seen it, have you?

					SARA
		I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if 
		I was sitting on it.

					WALTER
		You'd recognize it if you tasted it.

					SARA
		I doubt it, darling.

					WALTER
			(angling & bottle to the light)
		Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he 
		will be addressing 500 people in little over an 
		hour...

					SARA
		You want to keep him happy.

					WALTER 
		If he' s happy. . .
			(kissing her as he exits) 
		I'm happy.

	As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in 
	the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, 
	she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, 
	returning to the clamor inside her house.

	GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of 
	LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching 
	him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's 
	garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught 
	eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the 
	porch.

					GRADY
		James?

	James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a 
	GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at 
	what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's fake.

	James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY 
	peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The 
	sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED 
	PISTOL.

					JAMES LEER
		It was my mother's. She won it in a penny 
		arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic 
		school.

					GRADY
		It's very convincing.

					JAMES LEER
		It used to shoot these little paper caps, but 
		they don't make them anymore. The caps.

	GRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers 
	and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.

					JAMES LEER
		It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry 
		rabbits' feet...

					GRADY
		...You carry firearms.

	As GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass 
	briefly over the jay. GRADY
	notices, offers.

					JAMES LEER
		No, thank you. I don't like to lose control of 
		my emotions.

	GRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not supposed to be here, in case you were 
		wondering. I crashed. I mean, not 
		intentionally...

	James nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be 
	seen in a window, still fending off the determined Q.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		...but the other night, Hannah and I were 
		together, at the movies, and she asked me. 
		Since she was coming. So I ended up coming. 
		Too.

	GRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.

					GRADY
		Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?

					JAMES LEER 
		No! What gave you that idea?

					GRADY
		Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent 
		her a room.

					JAMES LEER
		She likes old movies like I do, that's ail.
			(glancing back at the window) 
		Besides, she doesn't really know me. She 
		thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's 
		because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.

					GRADY
		Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she 
		knows it and try as she might to not let that 
		screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in 
		some way.

	James looks away from the window, at Grady.

					JAMES LEER
		You're not like my other teachers, Professor 
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		You're not like my other students, James. So 
		what was the movie you two saw?

					JAMES LEER
		Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and 
		Frances Farmer.

					GRADY
		She went crazy, Frances Farmer.

					JAMES LEER
		So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.

					GRADY
		Sounds like a good one.

					JAMES LEER 
			(a crooked smile) 
		It's not bad.

	GRADY considers James' fragile face.

					GRADY
		Listen, James, about this afternoon. In 
		workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a 
		bit out of control.

					JAMES LEER
		They really hated it. I think they hated it 
		more than any of the other ones.

					GRADY
		Well...

					JAMES LEER
		It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to 
		write.

					GRADY
			(truly impressed) 
		Really? That's remarkable.

					JAMES LEER
		I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in 
		bed I figure them out. The stories.

	As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY 
	looks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat. 
	Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against 
	the modest bulk of the cap gun.

					GRADY
		You cold, James?

					JAMES LEER 
			(distant) 
		A little.

					GRADY
		So what are you doing out here?

					JAMES LEER 
		It's colder in there. -

					GRADY
			(laughing) 
		You're right.

	James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that 
	he's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhouse

					JAMES LEER
		Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought 
		...I thought I'd come out here and take a look 
		at it. You don't see one of those every day. It 
		looks like heaven...

					GRADY
		Heaven?

					JAMES LEER
		I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in 
		heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in 
		crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the 
		way I remember it...

	Abruptly, James glances at his watch.

					JAMES LEER 
		I should be going.

	James turns away, then stops. He stands like this a 
	moment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		Goodbye, Professor Tripp.

	GRADY hesitates, then shakes James' hand. James moves off 
	then, leaving the light of the house behind.

					GRADY
		James. 
			(as he stops)
		Don't leave just yet. There's something I 
		think you ought to see.

					JAMES LEER 
		I'll miss my bus.

					GRADY
		This is worth it.

	James looks conflicted.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Trust me.

15	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER  

	It's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past 
	the departing guests and toward the stairs.        

					HANNAH GREEN
		Hey, you two.

	GRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer.

					HANNAH GREEN (cont'd) 
		Are you riding with me, James?

					JAMES LEER 
		No, I'm going ho--

					GRADY
		He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his 
		friend. All right?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Ail right. By the way, his friend...?

					GRADY
		The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. 
		Where are they exactly?

					CRABTREE
		Here we are!

	CRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss 
	Sloviak. Her lipstick is blurry.

					CRABTREE
			(spying James) 
		Nell, hello there.

	CRABTREE steps down the stairs, hand extended. James 
	Leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string.

					GRADY
		James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.

					HANNAH GREEN
		James'll know about George Sanders.

					JAMES LEER 
		George Sanders?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders 
		killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.

					JAMES LEER
		Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel 
		room.

	The few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but 
	Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.

					CRABTREE
		How comprehensive of you.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie 
		suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else.

					JAMES LEER 
		There's so many...

					HANNAH GREEN
		Just a few then. The big ones.

	James glances at the loose group of people around him, 
	watching, then...

					JAMES LEER
		Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles 
		Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 
		1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an 
		accident, but, you know. . . 
			(a trace of irony)
		He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took 
		pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he 
		hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in 
		lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more 
		pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget 
		when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot 
		himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979. 
		Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret 
		Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. 
		Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 
		1978. There are more but I don't know if you 
		would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara 
		Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I haven't heard of half of those.

					CRABTREE
		You did them alphabetically.

	James turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James 
	blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs 
	shyly, looks away.

					JAMES LEER
		That's just how my brain works, I guess.

					CRABTREE
		Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out 
		with us after the lecture. There's a place on 
		the Hill I always get Trip to take me.

					JAMES LEER
		Actually. ..I just want to go home.

					CRABTREE
		Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants 
		to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. 
		Just think of it as a field trip.

	As he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if 
	to say: "Bring him."   MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James 
	glacially as we CUT TO:

	BLACK

	The dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR 
	opens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of 
	MARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day.

16	INT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE   

	GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the 
	photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN-
	STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN 
	JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.

					JAMES LEER 
		Is that really it?

					GRADY
		That's really it.

					JAMES LEER
		The one she wore on her wedding day?

					GRADY
		So I'm told.

	James, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide 
	garments, stands speechless.

					GRADY
			(cont'd) 
		Go ahead.

					JAMES LEER 
		Really?

					GRADY
		Really.

	James swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he 
	reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, 
	barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.

					JAMES LEER
		They're glass. The buttons.

					GRADY
		Like the lady herself.

	GRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a 
	bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the 
	jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.

					JAMES LEER
		She was small. Most people don't know that. 
		The shoulders are small.
			(touching the satin)
		It looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time 
		she wore it. That day. She must've felt so 
		...happy.

	GRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket, 
	lifts it lightly.

					JAMES LEER
		It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... 
		something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.

					GRADY
		I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth 
		about how much he pays for these things.

					JAMES LEER
		You're really good friends with the 
		Chancellor, aren't you?

	Grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains 
	unchanged, consumed with the jacket.

					GRADY
			(carefully)
		Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, 
		too.

					JAMES LEER
		I guess you must be, if you know the 
		combination to his closet and he doesn't mind 
		your being here in their bedroom like this.

					GRADY
		Right.

	A DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The 
	CLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom 
	window, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN 
	DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.

					GRADY
		We, better skedaddle. Close that closet-- 
		James? You ail right?

	James is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed, 
	knapsack between his knees, head in hands.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing 
		that jacket that belonged to her. It just 
		looks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a 
		closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.

					GRADY
		Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself 
		tonight.

					JAMES LEER 
		You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail? 
			(off Grady's look)
		Hannah mentioned something about it.   About a 
		note.

					GRADY
		Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we 
		should go now.

	Without thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light, 
	leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today.

	James just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.

17	INT. HALLWAY

	A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY
	as he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to 
	the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in 
	Grady's direction.

					GRADY
		Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .

	GRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward 
	and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle.

					GRADY
		Jesus!

	GRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the 
	ground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls his 
	head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap.

					GRADY
		Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!

	Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his 
	head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, 
	growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his 
	throat, until there is a sharp...

	CRACK! CRACK!

	Poe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily 
	onto Grady's legs. GRADY
	turns. James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the 
	little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen.

	GRADY looks at James. Then Poe. Then back to James.

					GRADY
		Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.

					JAMES LEER 
		I had to. Didn't I?

					GRADY
		Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?

					JAMES LEER
		No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1 
		thought --

					GRADY
		Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on 
		me.

	GRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through 
	life with a slight overbite.

					JAMES LEER
		Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see 
		if someone's breathing.

					GRADY
		He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead 
		dog when I see one.

	James looks miserably at Poe.

					JAMES LEER
		What are we going to do?

	GRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.

					GRADY
		First you're going to give me that little cap 
		gun of yours.

18	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING 

	GRADY and James stare gloomily out the windshield.

					JAMES LEER
		Professor Tripp? Can I  ask you a question?

					GRADY
		Yea, James.

					JAMES LEER 
		What are we going to do with...

	James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange 
	blue eyes gleaming.

					GRADY
		I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out 
		how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her 
		husband's dog.

					JAMES LEER
		You?

					GRADY
		Trust me, James, when the family pet's been 
		assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear 
		one of her students was the triggerman.

					JAMES LEER
		Does she want to hear it was one of her 
		professors?

					GRADY
		I've got tenure.

19	EXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS) 

	As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of 
	Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a 
	space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.

					GRADY
		Okay.

	James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs 
	looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps 
	forward, and takes the hind legs.

					JAMES LEER
		He's still a little warm.

	They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until 
	there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.

					JAMES LEER 
		Yuck.

	GRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.

					JAMES LEER 
		That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a 
		suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost 
		perfectly.

					GRADY
			(searching)
		That's just what they used to say in the ads. 
		Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...

					JAMES LEER
		Whose tuba is that anyway? 

					GRADY
		Miss Sloviak's.

					JAMES LEER
		Can I ask you something about her?

					GRADY
		She is. Ah. Here we go...

	GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane-
	size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of 
	boxers.

					JAMES LEER
		Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--
		gay?

					GRADY
		Most of the time he is, James. Some of the 
		time he isn't. Now what do we have here?

	GRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a 
	pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.

					GRADY
		Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That 
		should take the pinch out of my ankle.
			(handing the bottle to James) 
		Have one.

					JAMES LEER
		No thanks. I'm fine without them.

					GRADY
		Right. That's why you were standing in the 
		Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap 
		gun of yours tonight.  You're fine, all right, 
		you're fit as a fucking fiddle.

	GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth, 
	drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James.

					GRADY
		I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that.

	Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, 
	and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later, 
	he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill 
	from the lapel of his jacket.

					GRADY
		How 'bout we try that again.

20	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

	On the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium.

					WALTER
		...really needs no introduction. Walk down the 
		aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any 
		hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at 
		you. You all know the name, you all know the 
		books, so welcome if you will, the man those of 
		us who know him simply call.. .Q.

	As the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the 
	auditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an 
	open space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID 
	with a GOATEE .who regards him warily.
 
					Q 
		Good evening.

	GRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, 
	watching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting 
	until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory 
	hush. Finally, he speaks again.

					Q 
		I am a writer.

	As the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He 
	glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a 
	similar look of bafflement.

					Q (cont'd)
		As a writer, one thing you learn is that 
		everyone you encounter has a story. Every 
		bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an 
		idea or a. story that would make a "great book" 
		or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has 
		an idea. (gestures to the audience)
		But, how do you go from there to here? How do 
		you go from having an idea to having a book? 
		How do you get across? What is the bridge, the 
		bridge that allows you to walk on air from the 
		shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of 
		accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is 
		worth the telling, faith that you have the 
		wherewithal to tell it, faith that the 
		carefully woven structure you create won't 
		collapse beneath you...

	GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking 
	and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far 
	EXIT. A blink later, she is gone.

					Q (cont'd)
		...and faith that when you get to the other 
		side someone will be waiting who gives a damn 
		about the tale you have to tell.

	GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own 
	HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a 
	thread forty feet above his head...

	Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: 
	bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the 
	auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, 
	James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows 
	away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady.

	GRADY blinks, turns to James.

					GRADY
		I'll be right back.

21	INT. LOBBY

	GRADY bursts through the auditorium doors and into the 
	lobby. A PAIR. of local BOOKSELLERS, chatting quietly 
	behind a table arrayed with the BOOKS of attending authors, 
	glance up as GRADY limps toward the restrooms. 

22	INT. CORRIDOR  

	GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor 
	begins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his 
	cheek against the cool...cool...wall. ..as...ail..-goes....

	BLACK FOR A 

	MOMENT AND THEN....

					SARA'S VOICE 
		Grady? Grady?

	GRADY opens his eyes, finds Sara's face swimming above 
	him. He is lying on his back in the corridor, his corduroy 
	blazer bundled under his head like a pillow.

					SARA
		You had another one, didn't you? You have to 
		see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday 
		morning. All right?

					GRADY
		Is the thing-is it over?

					SARA 
		Almost. Wane to sit up?
			(as he winces) 
		What's the matter?

					GRADY
		Nothing. I think I twisted my--

	GRADY looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt.

					GRADY
		I have to tell you something. Something.. 
		.hard.

	Sara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque.

					SARA
		Then stand up. I'm too old for all this 
		roiling around on the floor.

	GRADY lets her pull him up, watches her light a 
	cigarette.

					GRADY
		Well...

					SARA
		Don't. I know what you're going to say.

					GRADY
		No, really, Sara, I don't think you--

					SARA
		You love Emily. I know that. And you need to 
		stay with her.

					GRADY
		I don't think I really have a choice in, that. 
		Emily left me.

					SARA
		She'll come back. That's why I'm going to. 
		..to not have this baby.

	GRADY watches her flip her hand up, bring the cigarette 
	to her lips, and inhale ...then grimace and drop it to the 
	floor.

					GRADY
		Not have it.

					SARA
		No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think 
		there's no way?

					GRADY
		Well, no, I don't see any way.
			(taking her hand)
		And I know how hard it is for you to-- to lose 
		this chance.

					SARA
			(jerking away)
		No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. 
		And fuck you for "saying. . .
			(quietly)
		...for saying there's just no way. Because 
		there could be a way, Grady.

	Somewhere deep in the building, APPLAUSE swells.

					SARA
			(composing herself)
		He must be finishing. We should go.

	GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his 
	coat.  As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTERS 
	to the floor.

					SARA
		Who's gun is that?

					GRADY
		It's-it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

	Before GRADY can close his hand, Sara has it in her own.

					SARA
		Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.

					GRADY
		Caps.

	She points it-at Grady's chest. He smiles nervously.

					SARA 
		Pow.

					GRADY
		You got me.

					SARA
		I love you, Grady.

	GRADY places his fingers gently over Sara's... and 
	removes the gun from her hand.

					GRADY
		I love you, too.

23	INT. LOBBY 

	The auditorium doors swing open and James Leer emerges, 
	arms draped over CRABTREE and a LARGE STUDENT.

					JAMES LEER
		Woah! The doors made so much noise!

	As they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear.

					JAMES LEER
		This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry 
		me out.

					GRADY
		Is he ail right?

					CRABTREE
			(rolling his eyes) 
		He's fine. He's narrating.

					JAMES LEER 
		We're going to the men's room. Only we might 
		not make it in time.

					SARA
		Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you 
		to make that mistake, wait here.

	As Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the 
	lobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		I need a ride.

					GRADY
		I'm your man.

24	EXT. STREET 24

	As the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK 
	stares at what's wedged up against her suitcase.

					GRADY
		There's an explanation.

	MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in, 
	unzips her suitcase.

25	INT.    GRADY'S CAR - MOVING   

	As GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top 
	button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered 
	COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the 
	glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL 
	POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the 
		poor thing?

					GRADY
		James is. ..I don't know...

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets 
		done with him, he's going to be even more 
		disturbed.

					GRADY
		I'm not sure that's possible.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Sure it is.

	GRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her 
	forehead.

					GRADY
		Listen, Antonia--

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Tony. Now that I'm home.

					GRADY
		Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so 
		well for you tonight. With Terry.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Forget it. I should've known better. Your 
		friend is just, I don't know, into collecting 
		weird tricks. Mind?

	Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself.

					GRADY
		He's writing his name in water.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		What's that?

					GRADY
		Like most editors, he really wants to be a 
		writer, but he's too busy living a novel to 
		bother writing one.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a 
		shit.

					GRADY
		He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the 
		feeling he's going through the motions a bit.

	Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		You mean because his career's ruined and all?

					GRADY
		Jesus. Is that what he told you?

					MISS SLOVIAK
		He said he hasn't had a success in ten years 
		and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of 
		.a. . .

	As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror, GRADY gets a glimpse 
	of his own swollen eyes.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good 
		that he'll be able to keep his job.

	Hearing this, GRADY looks troubled. MISS SLOVIAK points.

					MISS SLOVIAK
			(cont'd) 
		Turn here.

26	EXT. SLOVIAK HOUSE

	GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front 
	lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a 
	little white BAND SHELL painted with stars.

					GRADY
		That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese 
		beetle trap.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.

	The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN 
	squints through the screen door.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		There's Pop. 
			(turning)
		Let me see it. The gun.

	GRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony 
	smirks.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Figures. It's like the kind of gun Bette Davis 
		would carry. In a little beaded purse?

	GRADY studies the gun in Tony's hand, then glances at the 
	front screen door. Pop is still there.

					GRADY
		I'd better go. I think I may have to rescue 
		James Leer.

	MISS SLOVIAK returns the gun, .steps out of the car, and 
	peers in at Grady.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		You know, Grady, if I were you. I'd think 
		about going home. You look like you need a 
		little rescuing yourself.

27	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB 

	GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS 
	stenciled on the side. He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patron 
	in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then 
	slides -James Leer's little PISTOL into the glovebox.

27A	EXT. ENTRANCE - HI-HAT CLUB     

	As GRADY steps to the door, the bouncer gives him a 
	perfunctory pat-down.

					BOUNCER 
			(kidding him) 
		Clean tonight, hub, Professor?

					GRADY
		As a whistle.

28	INT. HI-HAT CLUB

	Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY 
	enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She beckons 
	with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her 
	glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated 
	shrug and she points.

	CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James 
	slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the 
	general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneath 
	the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap.

	Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing 
	WAITRESS.

					GRADY
		Double Dickel on the rocks.

29	INT. BOOTH 

	As GRADY arrives, CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately 
	and James' eyes flutter open .briefly, ..then close.

					GRADY
		Is that just beer?

					CRABTREE
		Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a 
		little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You 
		missed a few bottles, by the way.

					GRADY
		I'm sure. Where is everyone?

					CRABTREE
		Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to 
		go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.

	GRADY cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's 
	copped on Poe, but James is winking out. His head drifts 
	back against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk.

					GRADY
		Jesus. He's out.

	CRABTREE glances over, nods.

					CRABTREE
		He has a book.

					GRADY
		I know. He started it Fall semester.

					CRABTREE
		He finished it Winter Break.

	GRADY looks up, unable to disguise his surprise.  He 
	glances at James' slack face tilted against the wall.

					CRABTREE
		So. Is he any good?

					GRADY
		No. Not yet he isn't.

					CRABTREE
		Well, I'm going to read it anyway.

					GRADY
		Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one oÂ£ 
		my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure 
		if he's-

					CRABTREE
		He is. Take my word for it.

					GRADY
		I think it's more complicated than that. 
		Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost 
		...did something stupid tonight. At least, I 
		think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual 
		confusion thrown into the stew right now.

					CRABTREE
		On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.

					WAITRESS 
			(ducking in) 
		Double Dickel.

					GRADY
		Thanks.

	GRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes 
	she is conspicuously PREGNANT. He watches her disappear 
	beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah 
	Green's slinky form seizes his attention.

					CRABTREE
		No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?

					GRADY
		Shut up and drink.

	CRABTREE grins, brings his bottle up, then stops.

					CRABTREE
		Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see?

	GRADY follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but 
	it's not Oola CRABTREE
	is eyeing, it's her CUSTOMER.

					GRADY 
		President of the James Brown Hair Club For 
		Men.

	Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with 
	big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most 
	noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.

					GRADY
			(initiating an old game) 
		He's a boxer. A flyweight.

					CRABTREE
		Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis.. 
		.Curtis Hardapple.

					GRADY
		Not Curtis.

					CRABTREE
		Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are 
		from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and 
		got trampled.

					GRADY
		And now he's addicted to painkillers.

					CRABTREE
		He can't piss standing up anymore.

					GRADY
		He lives with his mother.

					CRABTREE
		And he had a younger brother who . . .was . . 
		. a. . .

					GRADY
		Groom. Named Claudell.  And his mother blames 
		Vernon for his death.

					CRABTREE
			(stumped)
		Because. . .because. . .

					JAMES LEER 
			(sleepily)
		.. .he was killed, when a gangster named 
		Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite 
		horse. He took the bullet himself.

	GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens 
	one bloodshot eye to regard them.

					JAMES LEER
		Vernon, over there, was in on the hit.

	James' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady.

					CRABTREE
		That was good.

					GRADY
		He heard everything we were saying.

	Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Come on. Teach. I want you to dance with me.

30	INT. DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          30

	GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the 
	jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a 
	sexy, measured blues.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's 
		so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail 
		your sentences always existed, just waiting 
		around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to 
		fetch them down.

					GRADY
		I thank you.

					HANNAH GREEN
		And I love the inscription you wrote to me. 
		Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think 
		I am.

					GRADY
		I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy 
		innocents we can get.

	GRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say 
	something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair 
	from James Leer's forehead.

					HANNAH GREEN
		So what are you going to do?

					GRADY
		Do?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to 
		be there when you get home.

	GRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then 
	catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The 
	tile that would reflect his head is missing.

					GRADY
		Are you holding me up or am I dragging you 
		down?

	Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Shush.

31	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB (2 AM)       

	Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to 
	Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender.

					GRADY
		Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make 
		sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I would if I knew where I was taking him.

					GRADY
		Hannah, are you telling me you don't know 
		where James Leer lives?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen 
		it.

					GRADY
		That strikes me as odd.

					HANNAH GREEN
		James is odd. I know he has an aunt in 
		Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, 
		but... 
			(remembering)
		Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's 
		house. He said she worked there. Or something. 
		I don't remember.

	James MUMBLES, starts to slide onto the hood of the car.

					JAMES LEER 
		Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap....

					GRADY
		What's he saying?

					HANNAH GREEN
		His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's 
		always carrying around. He must've left it 
		inside.

					GRADY
		Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...

	GRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street. 
	CRABTREE
	and Q huddle inside.

					GRADY
		Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the 
		auditorium.

					JAMES LEER
			(delirious, but insistent) 
		Mmrrmmm.. .KNAP SAP!

	GRADY frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		All right. Take him to my place. He can crash 
		on the sofa.

					HANNAH GREEN
		The one in your office? It's the best one .for 
		naps.

					GRADY
		I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We 
		could probably stand him up in the garage with 
		the snow shovels at this point.

	As GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls 
	into a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady.

					GRADY
		Ail right. In my office.

	As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his 
	face.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Hey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up.

	GRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and 
	drive away. He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has 
	his hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears.

	Vernon Hardapple.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		You driving this car?

					GRADY
		Excuse me?

					VERNON HARDAPPLE
		This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving 
		this car?

					GRADY
		It's mine.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.

					GRADY
		You must be mistaken.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		Bullshit.

	GRADY shakes his head wearily, opens the door.

					GRADY
		Go home to your mother, Vernon.

32	INT. GALAXIE      

	GRADY slides in next to Q, puts the car in gear, and 
	starts to pull away. As he glances in the rearview, he sees 
	CRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat.

					GRADY

		All right, what's the matter?

	CRABTREE just keeps smiling.

					GRADY
		Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? 
		The kid's practically in a coma.

					CRABTREE
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		Yes.

					CRABTREE
		Hit your brakes.

	GRADY flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a 
	SHADOW looms in his headlights. As he squashes the break 
	pedal, Q's EYEGLASSES go flying into the windshield.

					Q 
			(squinting)
		Oh my God! What is that?

	It's Vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the 
	beams of light.

					GRADY
		What's this guy's problem?

					CRABTREE
		Just go around him.

	GRADY taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances 
	back in front of Grady's grille.

					GRADY
		Shit.

					CRABTREE
		Back up. Go out the other way.

	GRADY throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then 
	turns up a one-way street. He shoots down the alley behind 
	the Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street, ..and watches 
	in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high 
	wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie.

	As GRADY pinches the brakes, Vernon grins.

					GRADY
		Now what?

					Q
			(mischievously)
		You could always go over him.

	Then, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his 
	heels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto 
	the Galaxie's big hood. He -lands on his ass, slides 
	smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the 
	night.

					Q 
		What just happened?

	GRADY peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood.

					GRADY
		I just had my car jumped on.

33	EXT. THAW HAIL - NIGHT (TWENTY MINUTES LATER) 

	Grady stops the car in the red zone and gets out.

					GRADY
		Wait here. I'll be right back.

					CRABTREE
		Where would we go?

34	INT. LOBBY   

	The JANITOR, the same shaggy-haired kid GRADY saw rigging 
	the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky 
	FLOOR WAXER as GRADY steps up to the double doors and slaps 
	his hand against the glass.

					JANITOR 
		It's open.

	GRADY pushes on the door and it opens.

					JANITOR (cont'd) 
		Hey, Professor Tripp. 
			(off Grady's look)
		Traxler. Sam. I took your class freshman year. 
		Then I dropped out of school.

					GRADY
		I hope it wasn't my fault.

					TRAXLER
			(taking him seriously)
		No. I guess you're here for the backpack. 

					GRADY
		Oh.. .yeah.

35	INT. AUDITORIUM       

	The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding 
	chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail.


					TRAXLER
		I saw the manuscript inside. So when you 
		showed up, I figured. . .

	GRADY lifts the knapsack, peers inside. There is no title 
	page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and 
	then, halfway down, TEXT.

					TRAXLER 
		Is it good?

					GRADY
			(reading)
		I don't know. It might be...

36     CUT

37	EXT. THAW HALL - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER 

	GRADY steps outside, closes the flap of the knapsack and, 
	hunching his shoulders against the cold... stops.

	Crabtree. Q. The car. Gone. 

38	INT. TRAXLER'S HONDA - NIGHT   

	Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the 
	original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The 
	backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR.

					TRAXLER
		Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true 
		about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on 
		his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last 
		longer?

					GRADY
		Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?

					TRAXLER 
		Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, 
		aren't you?

	Sam points and GRADY glances at the knapsack riding on 
	the seat between him and Sam. A BOOK'-bearing ERROL FLYNN'S 
	PICTURE--IS tucked into the side pouch.

					GRADY
		Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub 
		ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground 
		lamb.

					TRAXLER 
		Sick.

39	EXT. SASKELL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

	Sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street 
	from the Gaskell's house.

					TRAXLER
		Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that your 
		wife?

	GRADY gazes at Sara, a .vaporous blur in the greenhouse.

					GRADY
		No, my wife's out of town.

	Just then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom, 
	then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway. 
	Walter appears on the front steps.

					TRAXLER (cont'd) 
		Who's that guy?

					GRADY
		Her husband.

	Traxler looks anxiously at the police car.

					TRAXLER
		What exactly are we doing here, Professor 
		Tripp?

					GRADY
			(staring at Sara) 
		Taking the long way home.

39A	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER

	As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James 
	Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above 
	the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with 
	only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He 
	takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.

40	INT. .HALLWAY - GRADY'S HOUSE

	GRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him.

41	INT. LIVING ROOM     

	The room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes 
	of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he 
	finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T-
	shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling 
	hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet 
	Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but 
	his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He 
	steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his 
	disappointment--only the red cowboy boots.

	He picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits.

42	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

	James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old 
	sleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James' 
	knapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects 
	his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack.

	Something yellow. Something soft.

	GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing 
	a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET 
	from James Leer's ratty green knapsack. 

	GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking 
	very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the 
	light on the both of them.

43	EXT. FRONT PORCH - SATURDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY) 

	GRADY steps outside in a WOMAN'S CHENILLE BATHROBE and 
	plucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch 
	step. He fishes out a charred ROACH, starts to light it, 
	then notices the Galaxie sitting in the driveway.

44	INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER     

	As CRABTREE SNORES thunderously, GRADY eases open the 
	door, spots the CAR KEYS on the dresser, grabs them.

44A	INT. LANDING - CONTINUOUS

	GRADY eases the door shut, starts to turn, then stops, 
	his eyes drawn to the door just across the landing from 
	Crabtree's room.

44B	INT. EMILY'S OFFICE 

	GRADY pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers, 
	lets it glide open. The room that is revealed is bright and 
	well-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of 
	Grady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER, 
	pads and pens neatly arranged alongside.

	A BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate 
	mosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS, 
	framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's 
	DHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's 
	Daughter.

	There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck 
	with friends. In a sundress with Grady. In a billowing 
	Burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a BLUR of 
	YELLOW TAXIS on a street in Manhattan.

	Smiling brilliantly. Beautiful.

45	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

	GRADY enters with a THERMOS--pauses--redistributes the 
	sleeping bag over James Leer's pale body.

					JAMES LEER 
			(without waking) 
		Thank you.

					GRADY
		You're welcome.

	GRADY sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee 
	from the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the center 
	of a galaxy of previous coffee rings. Next, he takes a 
	clean piece of paper, balls it up, and-with ritual 
	precision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP 
	that crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room.

	All net.

	A 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and, without 
	further ceremony, GRADY
	turns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC 
	and SPACES to the top right corner, TYPES:

		(beat) 2611

	In other words: Page 2611.

	CLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS, 
	the KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that 
	grows and grows until, finally, it just ....Stops.

					GRADY
		James I  

	GRADY awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's 
	quizzical face floating like a cloud above him.

					GRADY
		I'm okay. I just lost my balance.

					JAMES LEER 
		I put you on the floor.

					GRADY
		Oh.

					JAMES LEER
		I thought you might--l don't know-- swallow 
		your tongue or something.
			(nodding to Grady's robe)
		I guess you really miss her, huh?

	GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets 
	of the robe, its overall fuzziness.

					GRADY
		Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write 
		in it.

					JAMES LEER
		I guess there's probably a story behind that.

					GRADY
		There is, but it's not that interesting.

	James nods. Down the hallway, in another room, the 
	TELEPHONE RINGS.

					JAMES LEER 
		Want me to get that?

					GRADY
		Sure.

	As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises 
	delicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to 
	see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.

					JAMES LEER 
			(returning)
		He didn't give his name.

					GRADY
		Who?

					JAMES LEER 
		The guy on the phone.

					GRADY
		What'd he say?

					JAMES LEER
		He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here 
		and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 
		with black interior.

					GRADY
		What'd you tell him?

					JAMES LEER
		Yes.

					GRADY
		Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be 
		sure to mention the back door pops open with a 
		couple hard shakes to the right.

					JAMES LEER
		I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or 
		something. Is that single-spaced?

	James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on 
	Grady's desk.

					GRADY
		Afraid so.

					JAMES LEER
		That's a big book you're writing.

					GRADY
		I think it's sort of writing itself at this 
		point.

					JAMES LEER
		Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, 
		but--

					GRADY
		But . . . ?

					JAMES LEER
		Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been 
		awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some 
		people--some of the kids in workshop--thought 
		maybe you were...

					GRADY
		Washed up?

					JAMES LEER 
		Blocked.

					GRADY
		Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.

	James takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.

					JAMES LEER
		No kidding.

	A LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch 
	Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, 
	materialize in the hallway.

					CRABTREE
		Good morning, boys. James.

	James waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag.

					GRADY
			(re: James' "attire") 
		If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast, 
		I'd put on something a little less comfortable 
		if I were you.

	As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the 
	page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare 
	into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE 
	seems to have made him suddenly queasy.

					JAMES LEER 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Hm.

					JAMES LEER 
		How did I get here last night?

					GRADY
		No one seems to know where you live, James. 
		Hannah thought you'd like my couch.

					JAMES LEER
		And ...and before that. Did I do anything? 
		Anything bad?

					GRADY
		Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the 
		English Department's dog and steal his most 
		prized piece of memorabilia.

	As James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY 
	looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now 
	parked at the bottom of his driveway.

					GRADY
		Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide.

46	EXT. FRONT PORCH

	A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the 
	door opens, GRADY
	appears.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		Good morning... 
			(eyeing Grady's robe)
		Professor Tripp? Sorry to bother you, sir, but 
		I understand you attended an event at Sara and 
		Walter Gaskell's house last night and were one 
		of the last to leave...

47	INT. LANDING - SAME TIME                                  47

	James lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the 
	sleeping bag, straining to hear.

					OFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.)
		...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone. 
		Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of 
		place. Suspicious maybe...

48	EXT. FRONT PORCH 

	GRADY is  scratching his head in mock thought.

					GRADY
		Well, there's always people you don't know at 
		these things, but I can't say there was anybody 
		particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one 
		guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		A jockey? You mean, like--

					GRADY
		Horses, right. Vernon something...
			(thinking... )
		Hardpple

	Pupcik stops on his pad, looks up.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		Hardapple?

					GRADY
		I could be wrong. What happened anyway?

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's 
		closet. And the dog's missing.

					GRADY
		That's weird.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's 
		blind and we figure he just wandered off and 
		got run over.

					GRADY
		The perpetrator.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		No, the dog.

					GRADY
		Just kidding.

	Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under "Dealing 
	With Assholes."

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		One other thing. About this kid, this student 
		of yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know 
		how I could get in touch with him, would you?

					GRADY
		I might have his number on campus.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		That's all right. We'll find him.

	Pete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and 
	turns away. GRADY frowns, starts to close the door...

					HANNAH GREEN (O.S.) 
		There you are...

	GRADY stiffens, then turns to find Hannah Green across 
	the room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots, looking ail dewy-
	eyed and delectable.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I thought we were going to talk. Last night.

					GRADY
		Oh. Well. I...

	Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up 
	her thighs.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It's okay. ..I'm here when you want me.

	GRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes 
	through the swinging door into the kitchen. A THUMPING is 
	heard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down 
	the last few steps of the stairway. He watches Pete Pupcik 
	drive away in his big police car.

					JAMES LEER 
		What do we do now?

#####Before GRADY can reply, .the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next to him 
#####RINGS.

					GRADY
		Hello?

					SARA'S VOICE
		Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You 
		won't believe what's happened.

					GRADY
		Could you hold on a minute, honey?

	With a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever-
	so- gently ...hang up the phone.

					GRADY
		How 'bout we get the hell out of here?

49	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) 

	James, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath 
	his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack 
	swinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of 
	KEYS.

					GRADY
		You start her up.

	As GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice 
	blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the 
	keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides 
	behind the steering wheel.

					JAMES LEER
			(as the engine roars) 
		How's that?

					GRADY
		Well done, James.

	As GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the 
	wedge SNAPS, splintering into the flesh of Grady's hand.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Shit!

	James blinks, pokes his head out the window.

					JAMES LEER
		You're bleeding. Professor Tripp.

50	INT. AISLE - MARKET - MORNING (LATER)   

	GRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a 
	neighborhood MARKET. GRADY
	has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering 
	his ragged thumb.

					GRADY
		Where exactly do you live, James?

	James, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of 
	ORANGE JUICE, stops.

					GRADY
		Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as 
		to the location of your apartment.

	GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic 
	hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.

					JAMES LEER
		I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked 
		out. I was asked to leave.

					GRADY
		I guess there's probably a story behind that.

					JAMES LEER
		There is, but it's not that interesting.

					GRADY
		So where have you been staying?

					JAMES LEER 
			(a long pause) 
		The bus station.

	GRADY stares incredulously at James.

					JAMES LEER
		It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor. 
		And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.

					GRADY
			(trying to fathom this) 
		But James. I mean. ..How long?

					JAMES LEER
		A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had 
		the gun. For protection.

					GRADY
		Jesus, James, you should've told someone.

					JAMES LEER 
		Who?

					GRADY
		I don't know...
			(unconvincingly)
		Me.

	GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and, 
	abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling 
	on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is 
	staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST 
	PAPERBACK. GRADY
	frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a 
	spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.

	A thought evolves.

					GRADY (cont'd)
			(the balloons)
		What do you think of these?

	James takes another chug from his jug, nods.

					JAMES LEER 
		Nice.

51	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING 

	Grady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared 
	ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in 
	front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off.

52	INT. GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS  

	GRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches 
	something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James 
	glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the 
	glovebox, then peers at the house.

					JAMES LEER 
			(the house) 
		Isn't this...?

					GRADY
		Hm.

	GRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange 
	juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down.

					GRADY
		You better ease off that stuff, James. It's 
		pretty acidic.

	James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, 
	studies it curiously.

					JAMES LEER
		I can't help myself. I don't know what's the 
		matter with me.

					GRADY
		Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you 
		think's the matter with you?

	As GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers 
	the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets 
	the donut in precisely the same place.

53	INT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER

	Through the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the 
	balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the 
	balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.

					SARA O.S.) 
		Feeling guilty?

	GRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized 
	behind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.

					GRADY
		Totally.  I'm sorry. A lot was happening this 
		morning. Can you talk?

	Sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.

					SARA
		Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for 
		WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole 
		Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, 
		too.

					GRADY
		I-heard.

					SARA 
		You heard? How?

					GRADY
		A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house 
		this morning.

					SARA 
		Did you confess?

	GRADY looks up, mildly alarmed.

					SARA
		Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

					GRADY 
		Really? That was fast.

					SARA 
			(frowning)
		I'm kidding. Hello?

					GRADY
		Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There 
		is something I need to tell...

					SARA
		Are you limping? Why are you limping?

					GRADY
		Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to . 
		. .

					SARA
		Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall 
		somewhere?

					GRADY
		No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I 
		don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell 
		you something.

					SARA 
		All right.

	Sara settles back, folds her arms. Waiting.

					GRADY
		I...

	As GRADY stares into Sara's eyes, things begin to blur. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
		 ...want to be with you.

	Sara looks at him.

					SARA
		Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.  I 
		don't know whether to swoon or smirk.

					GRADY
		Really, Sara, I...

	Sara holds up one gloved hand.

					SARA
		I believe you. I believe you want to be with 
		me. But this is not just about me anymore.

					GRADY
		I know that. I know what's at stake here...

					SARA
		No, I don't think you do. And besides... I 
		haven't decided yet.

					GRADY
		About the baby.

					SARA 
		That ...and you.

	GRADY goes still, watches Sara strip off the gloves, drop 
	them on  a table.

					SARA
		I'm not going to draw the map for you on this 
		one, Grady. Times like these you have to do 
		your own navigating.

	Sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the 
	street.

					SARA
		Who's that sitting in your car?

					GRADY
		James Leer.

					SARA 
		What's he doing out there?

					GRADY
		I'm sort of helping him work through some 
		issues.

	Sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.

					SARA 
		Isn't he lucky.

	GRADY watches her ripple across the glass, head for the 
	house, and wave. James, slumped low in the Galaxie, offers 
	a limp hand in return, but it's too late.

	She's already gone.

54	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - LATER 54

	GRADY cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw, while James 
	sits stiffly, the orange juice jug bobbing between his 
	thighs.

					JAMES LEER
		She seemed to take it pretty well.

					GRADY
		Yeah, well, actually. . .

	James looks over.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		The moment didn't really present itself.

	James nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window, 
	staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still. GRADY 
	glances at him. At the orange juice jug.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		You' re not planning on puking in my car, are 
		you, James?

	Nothing.

					GRADY
		Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley 
		Heights. We could find you a nice golf course 
		to barf on.

					JAMES LEER 
			(sharply) 
		No.

	GRADY looks over, surprised by the James' tone. James 
	blinks, looks embarrassed.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		I mean. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just...

	James peers out the window at passing landscape.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		I've got a thing about, ..places like this. I 
		know what those houses are like. I know what 
		the people are like.

					GRADY
		Your aunt ?

	James turns, eyes flashing with surprise.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Hannah mentioned something about an aunt.

	James nods vaguely, then reaches into the ashtray, takes 
	a JOINT between his fingers, sniffs it.

					JAMES LEER 
		Humboldt County?

					GRADY
			(surprised)
		Maybe...

					JAMES LEER
		It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.

					GRADY
		Glaucoma?

					JAMES LEER 
		Colon cancer.

					GRADY
		Jesus, James. Wow.

	James puts the joint back in the ashtray.

					JAMES' LEER
		It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a 
		small town.

					GRADY
		Where's that?

					JAMES LEER
		Carvel.

					GRADY
		Carvel? Where's Carvel?

					JAMES LEER 
		Outside Scranton.

					GRADY
		I never heard of it.

					JAMES LEER
		It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin 
		factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five 
		years.

					GRADY
		Your father worked in a mannequin factory?

					JAMES LEER
		Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn. 
		She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before 
		that, she'd been a dancer.

					GRADY
		What kind of dancer? .

					JAMES LEER
		Whatever kind they wanted her to be.

					GRADY 
			(in disbelief)
		James Leer, are you telling me your mother was 
		a stripper?

					JAMES LEER
		I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. 
		And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's 
		clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a 
		bad debt.

					GRADY
		Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic 
		school?

					JAMES LEER 
		When we fall, we fall hard.

					GRADY
		Amazing.

	GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then 
	notices-with surprise--James has his hand out.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		I thought you were the guy who didn't like to 
		lose control of his emotions.

					JAMES LEER
		Maybe I just needed the moment to present 
		itself.

55	EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY .(ONE HOUR LATER)

	GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a 
	modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the 
	JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers.

					JAMES LEER
		This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy 
		would live. What's it called again?

					GRADY
		Kinship.

					JAMES LEER
		Kinship. And what's here?

					GRADY
		Unless I miss my bet...my wife.

	James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise.

					JAMES LEER 
		The one that left you?

					GRADY
		That's right. That one.

56	EXT. FRONT PORCH - WINTERS FAMILY HOUSE

	GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against 
	the glass of the living room window, squints inside. 
	Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the 
	hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's 
	sitting in the indentation.


					JAMES LEER
		Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..-

					GRADY
		How can you tell?

					JAMES LEER
		You can see the outline of a butt.

	As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.

					GRADY
		Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you 
		can start on the box.

58	EXT. BACK PORCH - BACK YARD (MOMENTS LATER)

	As GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows.

					JAMES LEER
		Maybe she didn't come here.

					GRADY
		She came here. We'll just wait. In the 
		meantime, I need you to shimmy through.

	James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch 
	door.

					GRADY
		Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since 
		she was twelve years old. And your hips are as 
		slim as hers.

					JAMES LEER
		It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you 
		know-of what's in the car. In the trunk.

					GRADY
			(a pang of guilt himself)
		Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about 
		that.

	James takes another sad glance at the little door, then 
	drops onto ail fours.

59	INT. LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER     

	GRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it 
	speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so that 
	people will gather together, light a fire, talk.

					JAMES LEER 
		It feels really... good. ..here.

					GRADY
		I know. It's the house you want to wake up in 
		on Christmas morning.
			(moving off)
		Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

60	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 60

	Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a 
	DUFFEL BAG open on the floor, its contents a tangle of 
	quickly-packed clothes. Everything else in the room feels 
	of another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a 
	PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown.

	One photograph lies face down. GRADY turns it over and 
	finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, 
	standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their 
	wedding day.

61	INT. DEN     

	James enters, FRENCH ROLL in hand, and sees a REMOTE 
	CONTROL atop the BAR. Taking it, he points it at the WIDE- 
	SCREEN TELEVISION imbedded in the opposite wall and, 
	seconds later, GEORGE SANDERS walks into his CLOSE-UP.

					GEORGE SANDERS
		There's no such thing as a good influence, Mr. 
		Gray. All influence is immoral...

62	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME  

	Grady, a PINK PRINCESS PHONE to his ear, lies on the bed 
	next to a huge TEDDY BEAR.

					GRADY
			(into phone)
		Yes, I' m looking for the Chancellor... I 
		don't know. She should be in the main hall 
		...Thank you.

63	INT. DEN     

	James runs through the channels, pauses on MARTIN MILNER 
	and GEORGE MAHARIS, riding in their curvy Corvette.

64	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME   

	A Nelson Riddle's THEME FROM ROUTE 66 BOOMS from below, 
	GRADY
	cups a hand over his ear.

					GRADY
		Sara? Hi. It's Grady.

					SARA'S VOICE
		Where are you, Grady? An elevator?

					GRADY
		I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some 
		things we need to talk about...

					SARA'S VOICE
			(evenly)
		You're in Kinship?

					GRADY
		Yes. But that's not why I called...

					SARA'S VOICE
		With Emily?

					GRADY
		What? No'. There's no one here. I'm just 
		...just....

					SARA'S VOICE
		Just what? Doing a little dusting?

	As GRADY endeavors to respond, TWO YOUTHFUL VOICES, 
	CHEERFULLY SINGING, rise from below.

					CHEERFUL VOICES       
		Good Morning! Good Morning!

					GRADY
			(yelling)
		James! For Christ sake, will you turn that 
		thing down!

					SARA'S VOICE
		James? He's still with you?

65	INT. DEN 

	James, in the midst of pouring himself a tumbler of 
	Bushmills, smiles as JUDY GARLAND and MICKEY ROONEY sing 
	their hearts out in Babes In Arms.

					JUDY/MICKEY
		We talked the whole night through!

66	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 

	GRADY shakes his head, carries the phone toward the 
	bedroom WINDOW.

					GRADY
		Look, Sara. ..I'm not here. ..I'm not here to 
		. . .

	As GRADY watches, a late-model PONTIAC BONNEVIlLE turns 
	into the driveway below him.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		 ...reconcile with Emily.

					SARA'S VOICE
		Are you there to not reconcile with her?

	The Bonneville's trunk pops open, revealing THREE BAGS OF 
	GROCERIES, and HANK and IRENE WINTERS, both in their 60's, 
	get out. An enormous NEWFOUNDLAND vaults from the backseat.

	Sara, eating phone static this whole time, interprets 
	Grady's silence her own way.

					SARA'S VOICE (cont'd) 
		Goodbye, Grady.

					GRADY
		No. Sara, you don't understand...

					SARA'S VOICE
		Trust me, I understand. I just want to say 
		something to you, Grady.

					GRADY
			(dreading it) 
		Yea?

					SARA'S VOICE
		How you choose to live your own life is your 
		business. But you be careful with that boy, 
		Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.

	As the line goes dead, GRADY watches Hank and Irene 
	Winters disappear below him.

69	INT. DEN       69

	James--Irish whiskey in one hand, the pride of Humboldt 
	County in the other--watches with deep absorption as Judy 
	and Mickey have a heartfelt conversation. Then, sensing 
	something ...he turns.

	Hank and Irene Winters, grocery bags in arm, stand 
	frozen.

					JAMES LEER     
		Hullo.

	FOOTSTEPS are HEARD on the staircase and GRADY hobbies 
	into view. He tries a smile.

					GRADY
		Mom. Dad.

70	INT. DEN - WINTERS HOUSE - (A BIT LATER) 

	Hank Winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of 
	tape, a bottle of alcohol, and some cotton wool.

					HANK
		Well, it's infected, I can tell you that. I'm 
		just going to clean it up a bit. It's up to you 
		to-find someone who knows what they're doing. 
		Here. Put your foot up.

	GRADY puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a 
	BOOK lying face down on the seat. The AUTHOR on the back 
	cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look 
	consequential. To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author 
	is himself.

					HANK
		So he's one of your students, this boy?

	GRADY glances into the living room, where James and Irene 
	sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. James 
	is looking out the window, a curious expression on his 
	face. GRADY looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland 
	sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk. When he glances 
	back into the living room, he and James make brief eye 
	contact, then blink, look away.

					GRADY
		Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed 
		up.

					HANK
		Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll 
		be fine.

	GRADY tries to read Hank's face---is he messing with 
	him?--but Hank gives nothing away. GRADY nods to the book.

					GRADY
		What made you pull out that old thing?

					HANK
			(shrugging)
		I was thinking of you.

					GRADY
		And?

					HANK
		It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you 
		know that. It's a young man's book. It got me 
		remembering how it felt to be young.

					GRADY
		Maybe I should read it.

					HANK
		Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you 
		aging prematurely, Grady.

	GRADY doesn't have to read Hank's face this time.

					GRADY
		Where's Emily, Hank?

					HANK
		I 'don't know if she'd want me  to tell you 
		that, Grady.

					GRADY
		I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just. 
		..want to know where I stand.

	Hank looks up, incredulous.

					HANK
		Where you stand?

					GRADY
			(embarrassed)
		l-just want to say I'm sorry.

					HANK
		She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The 
		neurologist.

					GRADY
		Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?

					HANK
			(frowning)
		Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley 
		together.

					GRADY
			(sheepishly)
		Oh. Right. Linda ...I haven't been doing a lot 
		of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I 
		have the book to finish and--

					HANK
		Ah, right. The book.

	GRADY starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something 
	in Hank's tone, something dismissive. Instead, he looks 
	away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James 
	again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I 
		didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want 
		you to know that.

					HANK
		Why did you come here, Grady?

	GRADY gestures vaguely.

					GRADY
		I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily. 
		And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let 
		everyone know that, even though it may be 
		difficult to comprehend now, this-everything 
		that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't 
		mean "Goodbye."

					HANK
		Give me a break, Grady.

	Hank snaps off the tape, slaps Grady's ankle.

					HANK
		You're done.

71	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - DUSK   71

	GRADY glowers darkly at the road, then puts his hand up 
	against the HEATING VENT which, apparently, is not putting 
	out any heat.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm having a really good time, Professor 
		Tripp.

	GRADY glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc.

					GRADY
		I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a 
		favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's 
		not for amateurs.

	James looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat 
	LEVER.

					JAMES LEER 
		I just wanted a little sip.

					GRADY
			(squinting at him)
		I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, 
		exactly what point was it that you turned into 
		Serpent Boy?

					JAMES LEER
		Probably about the time you gave me the 
		codeine pills last night.

	GRADY stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose 
	face bears not the slightest trace of irony.

					GRADY
		Jesus... 
			(thinking, then. . . )
		Look, James, you appear to possess-like many 
		an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a 
		rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which 
		dreams are made. However, I 'think it's best 
		if, for the moment at least
			(taking the Ziploc)
			...we abstain.

					JAMES LEER 
		You're mad at me, aren't you?

					GRADY
		What?

					JAMES LEER
		You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's 
		dog.

					GRADY
		It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's--
			(stopping)
		Who said anything about girlfriend?

	James eyes shift slowly, as if to 'say: Who are you 
	kidding?

					GRADY
		Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my 
		girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't 
		exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no 
		reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, 
		the fact remains that I'm the one who took you 
		up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one 
		who has to take the blame. I- don't know what 
		the hell I was thinking.

					JAMES LEER
		Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap 
		gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 
		'I can't let that kid get on. the bus alone-he 
		might never get on the bus again.' You were 
		thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract 
		this kid. ' So you did. It was--in its way--a 
		noble act.

					GRADY
		Thanks for the halo, James, but I've . never 
		done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever.

	James looks -out the window, pondering this.

					JAMES LEER
		So, why did you take me up there?

					GRADY
			(feeling for the heat again)
		I -don' t know, James . I don' t know why I do 
		half the things I do. Who does?
			(looking over)
		Why do you wear that coat?

	James looks down, a little defensive.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's warm.

					GRADY
		James, fall semester, first day of class, it 
		was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.

	James just blinks, no ready answer-available.

					GRADY
		That's why they all give you such a hard time 
		in workshop.

					JAMES LEER 
		Because of my coat?

					GRADY
		Because you act like a goddamn spook all the 
		time. Not to mention the fact that every last 
		one of them is jealous of you.

					JAMES LEER 
			(smirking) 
		Jealous? Of me?

					GRADY
		Not you. Your talent.

	James' face hardens. He looks away.

					JAMES LEER 
		You're lying.

					GRADY
		The hell I am.

					JAMES LEER
		Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You 
		said so yourself.

					GRADY
		I never said that.

					JAMES LEER
		Yes you did. Last night. To your friend 
		Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you 
		said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.

					GRADY
		I didn't mean it that way.

					JAMES LEER
		It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, 
		the others--they 're right. My stories are 
		annoying. They go on and on and on, and the 
		longer they go on the more annoying they 
		become, until finally you just want to grab 
		something heavy and--

					GRADY
		Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and 
		Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking 
		about, okay? The entire class combined-
		including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one 
		tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

	James stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the 
	window. He ponders Grady's words, the praise inherent in 
	them. A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.

					JAMES LEER 
		But, last night...

					GRADY
		Who cares what-. I said last night, James I I 
		was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a 
		dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me 
		some slack?

					JAMES LEER 
			(quietly) 
		I'm sorry.

					GRADY
		And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares 
		what anybody thinks anyway? You want to .be a 
		good writer? You want to be-a great writer? 
		Then stop giving a damn what other people 
		think. Most of them haven't thought in .years.

	James turns, studies Grady's face as it flickers in the 
	first headlights of the evening.

					GRADY
		Let me spell it .out for you, James. Books 
		don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not 
		anymore.

					JAMES LEER
		Arsonist's Daughter meant something.

	GRADY smiles contemptuously.

					JAMES LEER
		I mean it. It means something to me. It's one 
		of the reasons I came to school here. To be in 
		your class. To be taught by you.
			(quietly)
		It's one of the reasons I wanted to become a 
		writer.

	GRADY stares ahead, watching the darkness tumble away 
	before the wide sweep of the Galaxie's headlights.

					GRADY
		Well, for that, if nothing else, James, I'm 
		sorry.

72	EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL - OFF THE HIGHWAY - EVENING 

	GRADY rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James 
	slides out. GRADY
	stays put, hands still on the wheel.

					JAMES LEER
		You coming?

					GRADY
		In a minute. Get us a table.

	James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee 
	shop, and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a 
	table with a view of the highway. GRADY
	watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into 
	the booth and open his big, laminated menu.

	Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY 
	kicks open his door, steps out.

73INT/	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER  

	GRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he 
	speaks.

					GRADY
		C-a-r-v-e-I. That's right, Carvel. Yes, I'm 
		sure. It's outside Scranton.

	GRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by 
	himself on the far side of the coffee shop.

					GRADY
		You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at 
		this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a 
		resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd 
		be pretty interested to learn that the good 
		people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his 
		entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this 
		up as I go along--

	GRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Never mind. My mistake.

74	EXT. GALAXIE - PARKING LOT     74

	GRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An 
	AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of 
	CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows 
	peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch.

	He takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice: 
	James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS it 
	says only: "On File." But if one was to dial the PHONE 
	NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the 
	Greyhound depot who picks up.

75	INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER)

	The remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as 
	he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE 
	PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars 
	that whip by on the highway beyond the window.

					JAMES LEER 
		Want a bite?

					GRADY
		No thanks.

					JAMES LEER
		That's why you're having them. Your spells.

					GRADY
		Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like 
		we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't 
		have spells.

					JAMES LEER 
		What would you call them then?

					GRADY
		I don't know. ...'Episodes.'

	James shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.

					JAMES LEER
		It's because you don't eat.

					GRADY
		I eat.

					JAMES LEER
		When?

					GRADY
		When nobody's looking.

	GRADY watches a pair of headlights approach...

					JAMES LEER
			(mouth full, garbled)
		I just worry about you, that's all.

	...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks 
	at him.

					GRADY
		You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?

					JAMES LEER
		Okay.

	Just then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against 
	the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking 
	lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		Where you going?

					GRADY
		Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.

	GRADY moves off, then stops, looking back at James and 
	his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words.

76	EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL   

	As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER 
	MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming 
	BLACK MERCEDES. Beyond him, in the front passenger seat, a 
	WOMAN in MINK examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror of 
	the sun visor.

					MAN
			(eyeing GRADY dubiously) 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Grady.

					MAN
		Fred Leer. This is my wife Amanda.

					GRADY
			(re: their clothes)
		Looks like I've dashed a-wonderful evening.

					FRED LEER
		Hardly.

					AMANDA LEER
		We were on our way to a benefit. But, as luck 
		would have it, the club was on the way, so... 
			(snapping shut the visor)
		We were able to put in an appearance.

					FRED LEER
		Otherwise we would've been here earlier.

					GRADY
		Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a 
		little dinner.

					FRED LEER
		Well, certainly we'll reimburse you.

					GRADY
		That's not necessary. I just felt. ..it might 
		be good for James to be with his family this 
		weekend.

					FRED LEER
		Well, of course, we can understand that.

	GRADY considers the two glittering ghosts before him. 
	They seem to be waiting. Just waiting.

					GRADY
		Well. Let me go get him.

	GRADY turns for the coffee shop, then stops, looks back.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		I "hope you won't consider this forward of me, 
		Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask. ..did you 
		ever attend Catholic school?

	Amanda Leer's eyes narrow ever-so-slightly.

					AMANDA LEER 
		Excuse me?

77	INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP77 

	James is glowering at the parking lot as GRADY returns.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not going with them..

					GRADY
		James. Listen. Things-things are a little 
		weird with me right now and I-- well--I have 
		enough blame to shoulder these days without 
		having to take the blame if something bad 
		happened to you. And if you hang around me long 
		enough, something bad is going to happen, trust 
		me. That's why I need you to go home. 
		Understand?

					JAMES LEER 
		I'm not going, with them.

					GRADY
		James, like it or not, they're your parents.

					JAMES LEER
		Parents? They're not my parents. They're my 
		grandparents. My parents are dead.

	GRADY stares at-James wearily.

					JAMES LEER
		I swear. My father had his own airplane he 
		used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and 
		my mom were flying up to our house in the 
		Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in 
		the newspaper.

	GRADY doesn't flinch, unpersuaded.

					JAMES LEER
		I 'swear. My father was a senior vice 
		president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite. 
		Her maiden name was Guggenheim.

	GRADY starts to protest, then pauses.

					GRADY
		I remember that. Five or six years ago.

					JAMES LEER
		Six. Their plane went down right outside 
		Scranton.

					GRADY 
			(sardonically) 
		Near Carvel?

					JAMES LEER
		I'm sorry about all that. I just-I don't like 
		to talk about my family. They treat me like a 
		freak. 
			(nodding towards Amanda)

	She makes me sleep in. the basement of my own house. It's 
	mine. My parents left it to me.

	GRADY glances toward the parking lot, studies the  
	contours of Fred Leer's face. Frowns.

					GRADY
		James, come on. That man is obviously your 
		father. You look just like him.

	James looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and 
	speaks in a voice heavy with implication.

					JAMES LEER
		There's a reason for that.

	Grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little 
	riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting.

					GRADY
		Get out of here.

					JAMES LEER
		That's why she hates me. That's why she makes 
		me sleep in the basement.

					GRADY
		In the crawl space, with the rats and the 
		casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.

	As GRADY lifts him from the booth, James attempts a 
	plaintive tone, but his heart's not in it.

					JAMES LEER 
		I swear.

78	EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER       78

	As Fred Leer SLAMS the back door of the Mercedes, GRADY 
	waves vaguely, peers into the darkness of the back seat.

					FRED LEER 
		Thank you. Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
		Take care of him.

					AMANDA LEER
		Oh, don't worry. We'll take care of him. You 
		can be sure of that.

	Fred Leer hits the gas and swings the Mercedes around in 
	a tight little arc, feathering Grady's pants--from the knee 
	down--with a pudding of ICE and MUD. GRADY glances down at 
	his spattered self, then notices, sitting on the front 
	passenger seat, James' knapsack. GRADY grabs it, turns.

					GRADY
		Hey!

	GRADY'S POV - REAR WINDOW
	as the Mercedes begins to pull away and James turns, 
	elbows on the back dash, his pale face slack. Spying Grady, 
	he raises one limp hand, and then-as if it were held by a 
	string-lets it drop.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(softly) 
		Hey.

79	EXT. PARKING LOT - MQTEL/COFFEE SHOP - A. BIT LATER   

	GRADY sits in-the GREEN GLOW of .the radio dial, smoking 
	a joint. He glances at the knapsack, sees James' 
	MANUSCRIPT:

	The Love Parade

	He reaches in, takes the manuscript and, in the light 
	that rains from the PARKING LAMP overhead, begins to read.

80	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)      80

	Grady's HOUSE looks like a three-dollar whore on a block 
	full of nuns. MUSIC BLARES, LIGHT BLAZES from every window, 
	and there are so many CARS GRADY is forced to leave the 
	Galaxie in the middle of the street.


					GRADY
			(knowingly) 
		Crabtree.

81	INT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER  

	Times Square before the ball drops. GRADY enters, scans 
	the room, then shoulders his way to the stairs.

82	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE  

	Hannah Green sits on the sofa, twisting a long strand of 
	hair around her finger as she reads a THICK MANUSCRIPT.

					GRADY
			(entering) 
		Hey.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Grady!

	She slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at 
	her thigh. GRADY
	stares. The manuscript. It's his.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(embarrassed)
		I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, 
		just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist 
		and-and--I suck.

					GRADY
		No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it 
		out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn't been 
		in here, has he? Poking around?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I don't know--maybe- I don't think so.

	Grady's  mind races with unfortunate possibilities, but 
	only briefly: his immediate thoughts are elsewhere.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that 
		aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.

					HANNAH GREEN
		He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The 
		blind one.

					GRADY
		Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What?

					HANNAH GREEN
		At first the police thought he just ran away, 
		but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood 
		spots on the carpet -

					GRADY
		Jesus.

					HANNAH GREEN
		CRABTREE said it sounded like something James 
		would be messed up in.

					GRADY
		Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Who does?

	Just then, Crabtree's VOICE bellows in the hallway 
	outside.

					CRABTREE (O.S.) 
		Trip?! Where are you'

	GRADY looks anxiously toward the door.

					GRADY
		The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James 
		that day?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I told you, Sewickly Heights.      

					GRADY
		But where? I need the street.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a 
		corner. 

					CRABTREE (O.S.)
		Trip?!

					GRADY
		Shit.

	As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah hooks her finger 
	inside his belt buckle.

					HANNAH GREEN
		No! Don't go. I've been waiting ail night for 
		you.

	GRADY looks at Hannah's hand, where it rests. He looks 
	terrified.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but 
		right now I--

					CRABTREE
			(bursting in)
		Tripp, where the hell. . .

	CRABTREE stops, takes in the tableau before him.

					CRABTREE (cont'd)
		Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting a. student-
		teacher conference?

	GRADY delicately removes Hannah's hand from his buckle, 
	points at Crabtree.

					GRADY
		You stay there.

					CRABTREE
		What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?

	CRABTREE cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked 
	on Grady's desk.

					CRABTREE
		Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would 
		sneak in here and read your book without asking 
		you?

					GRADY
		Gee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to 
		remember you actually asking me if you could 
		invite 200 people over to trash my living room.

					CRABTREE
		Sometimes we have to improvise.

					GRADY
			(ignoring him)
		Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I 
		mean, besides you and. ..me?

					CRABTREE
		James? My James? What's happened?

					GRADY
		Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't 
		know.. .kidnapped.

					CRABTREE
		Kidnapped? By who?

					GRADY
		His parents.

					CRABTREE
		Good God. Let's go rescue him.

					GRADY
		Good idea. Crabs. Only one problem. I don't 
		know where they live.

					CRABTREE
		Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know 
		where he lives.

					GRADY
		It's a little late to call Admissions.

					CRABTREE
		Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?

					GRADY
		Maybe ...I don't know.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Two-sixty-two Baxter Drive.

	GRADY and CRABTREE turn, see Hannah sitting on the corner 
	of Grady's desk with the WHITE PAGES open on her lap.

					HANNAH GREEN (cont'd)
		They're in the book.

83	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - TEN MINUTES LATER

	CRABTREE snaps James' manuscript closed.

					CRABTREE
		You know--based on what I've read-- this is a 
		very exciting piece of material, this Big 
		Parade.

					GRADY
		Love. It's Love facade--and what do you mean 
		'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two 
		chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling 
		methamphetamines.

					CRABTREE
		I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I 
		feel this kid in my bones.

					GRADY
		Only in your bones?

	GRADY smirks, glances at Crabtree, but gets a surprise; 
	CRABTREE offers no snappy come-back, no antic wordplay. He 
	just stares out the window, his voice distant.

					CRABTREE
		No. I think I might be right. I've felt it 
		before...

	As Crabtree's voice trails off, GRADY studies him.

					GRADY
		How bad is it for you?

					CRABTREE
		Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit 
		the new corporate profile.

					GRADY
		Which is?

					CRABTREE
		Competence.

	GRADY and CRABTREE look at each other a moment, then 
	CRABTREE smiles, gives a little shrug, and picks up James' 
	knapsack, rummaging through the contents.

					CRABTREE (cont'd) 
		So tell me about you and the Chancellor.

					GRADY
		What's to tell?

					CRABTREE
		Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...

	CRABTREE fishes out the biography of Erroll Flynn, gives 
	it a look.

					CRABTREE
		...I like her.

	GRADY peers at the stars, his voice barely audible.

					GRADY
		Me too.

84	EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SEWICKLEY HEIGHTS     84-

	The battered Galaxie floats up a narrow road, gliding 
	through a canyon of mansion walls and the occasional 
	winding drive. Up ahead a stone post marker with the 
	numerals "262." GRADY kills the headlights.

					GRADY
		This is it.

84A	EXT. LEER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Grady--limping like an aging prizefighter--leads CRABTREE 
	up a steep incline toward an enormous three-story house. 
	The Leer's Mercedes gleams in the shadows.

					CRABTREE
		Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on . 
		that thing. How are we-supposed to find his?

					GRADY
		I told you. They keep him chained in the 
		basement. Come on.

85	EXT. REAR - LEER HOUSE

	LIGHT GLOWS from a low BASEMENT WINDOW. From one side, a 
	WOMAN is HEARD SINGING. GRADY and CRABTREE pause, listen.

					WOMAN SINGING 
		Why should I care though he gave me the air? 
		Why should I cry, heave a sigh, and wonder why? 
		And wonder why?

					CRABTREE
		Doris Day.

	CRABTREE and GRADY look at each other.

					GRADY/CRABTREE
		James Leer.

	GRADY moves to the window and RAPS on the glass. A moment 
	later, James peeks out. Seeing Grady, his face brightens 
	briefly, unguarded, then quickly resumes its usual Leerian 
	aspect. He motions with his hand, as if to say, "That way."

86	EXT. BASEMENT DOOR    

	The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in 
	a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the 
	seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves.

					JAMES LEER
		Hey. What are you guys doing here?

					CRABTREE
		We're springing you. Leer. Get some pants on.

	As they step inside, GRADY gives James' PJs the once-
	over.

					GRADY
		I can't believe you made fun of my robe.

87	INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT    87

	Electric CANDELABRAS light a large converted cellar whose 
	walls are crowded with MOVIE POSTERS and LOBBY CARDS. There 
	are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and 
	an enormous BAROQUE BED, complete with CANOPY.

					CRABTREE
		I like what you've done with it. When's 
		Captain Nemo moving in?

					JAMES LEER 
		The candelabras were my Gran's.

					GRADY
		Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll 
		leave you here.

					CRABTREE
		Hey, I heard all about it--the parents, the 
		grandparents, the China town thing-- and I 
		believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now 
		go get dressed.

	James scoops up the shirt GRADY lent him. this morning.

					JAMES LEER
		Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this 
		again. Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Ah, wear whatever you want.

	James flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom.

					CRABTREE
		So modest.

					GRADY
		So sensitive.

					CRABTREE
			(nosing around the room)
		Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.

					GRADY
		It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just 
		once I'd like to know if the little bastard is 
		telling the truth.

					CRABTREE
		The-truth. I know that's always been real 
		important to you. Key, check this out...

	CRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER, reads from 
	the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage.

					CRABTREE
		Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock to: 
		see him, shuffling into the room like an aging 
		prizefighter. Limping. Beaten.'
			(with an amused smile) 
		Sound like anyone we know?
			(resuming) 
		But it was later, when the great man squinted 
		into the bitter glow or twilight...
			(frowning)
		Bitter glow of twilight? This kid definitely 
		needs an editor.
			(resuming)
	...and muttered simply, "It means nothing. All of it. 
	Nothing," that the true shock came. It was then that the 
	boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in 
	a darker place. His heart...'

	CRABTREE stops abruptly.

					GRADY
		Yes? 'His heart...'

	CRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on:

					CRABTREE
		'His heart, once capable of inspiring others 
		so completely, could no longer inspire so much 
		as itself. It beat now only out of habit. It 
		beat now only because it could. '

	GRADY nods, his face unreadable, then James returns.

					JAMES LEER 
		I'm ready...

	James stops, sees the two men looking at him.

					JAMES LEER 
		You all right, Professor Tripp?

					CRABTREE
		He's great. Come on, let's blow before ol' 
		Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.

					JAMES LEER
		Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming 
		down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, 
		check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call 
		the police or.. .something.

					CRABTREE
		Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows 
		and one of your teddy bears under the spread 
		and she won't know the difference.

					JAMES LEER 
			(brightening)
		Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use 
		a couple big hams.

					GRADY
		No.

	CRABTREE and James turn.

					GRADY
		I've got something better than a teddy bear.

	CUT TO: POE -- as he's lowered delicately onto James' 
	bed. 

88	INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT (A FEW MINUTES LATER) 

	GRADY strategically arranges the coverlet, gently 
	adjusting Poe's head so only a TUFT of FUR shows. He steps 
	back, joining CRABTREE and James for an assessment.

					GRADY
		Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

89	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - LATER 

	The lights are still blazing, the front door is wide 
	open, but not a soul remains.

90	INT. LIVING ROOM

	A quiet disaster, the only sound an LP playing meekly on 
	the STEREO. James passes through first, ignoring the 
	TORTILLA CHIPS POPPING under his shoes, then CRABTREE and 
	GRADY appear.

					CRABTREE
		Things must've picked up after we left.

	CRABTREE pats Grady's cheek, heads upstairs. 

91	INT. HALLWAY

	Crabtree's door is closing as GRADY hobbles into view.

					GRADY
		Crabtree.

					CRABTREE
			(sticking his head out) 
		Ye-es?

	GRADY looks down, sees James Leer's black brogues sitting 
	on the floor outside Crabtree's door.

					GRADY
		Nothing.

	The door closes, the LATCH CLICKS, and GRADY is left 
	alone, the bossa nova floating softly in the air.

92	INT. HANNAH'S ROOM 

	Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets, surrounded by 
	little colonies of Grady's manuscript. GRADY studies her, 
	then detects something on the floor. The red boots.

	Delicately, he lifts the sheet. Hannah Green's feet-- 
	finally revealed in ail their naked glory--prove to be 
	thick, wide, and ordinary. GRADY
	sighs.

93	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE 

	The TV is on. GRADY steps to the doorway, pauses.

					VOICE 
		Hey.

	A HEAD cranes over the sofa. It's the Goatee Kid from 
	Thaw Hail.

					GRADY
		How are you--is it Joe?

					GOATEE KID
		Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your 
		house until about an hour ago.

					GRADY
		Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.

					GOATEE KID
		Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, 
		what I said that time in office hours-I hope 
		there's no hard feelings.

					GRADY
		No...

					GOATEE KID
		I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at 
		the time and my car was ail fucked up and--
		well--I was pretty bent in general.

					GRADY
		It's cool, Jeff. Really.

					GOATEE KID
		I just want you to know that's why I dropped 
		your class and said all that shit about the 
		university stealing my money and you being a 
		pseudo-Faulknerian nobody.

94	EXT. PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (A BIT LATER)

	GRADY sits quietly on the porch steps, a joint burning in 
	his fingers. To his left, perched atop a Haagen-Dazs 
	container, is a TELEPHONE. As he pulls it into his lap, a 
	LAMP in the living room pirouettes clumsily, spins free of 
	the cord, and SHATTERS on the floor.

	GRADY blinks, looks away, and DIALS, just as. ..the 
	CLATTERING COUGH of an ENGINE is HEARD and a VAN appears. 
	Stenciled on its side panel is:

	Kravnik's Sporting Goods

	The van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past 
	Grady's house and disappears around the corner. GRADY 
	frowns, then realizes a MAN'S VOICE is coming from the 
	RECEIVER in his lap.

					MAN (O.S. ) 
		Hello? Hello...?

	The VOICE is groggy. It is Walter Gaskell's voice.

					GRADY
		Walter?

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Yes?

	GRADY says nothing, as if wondering what he's doing.

					WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd) 
		Who's this ?

					GRADY
		It's Grady, Walter.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Grady?

					GRADY
		GRADY Tripp. English Department.

					WALTER'S VOICE
		I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, 
		Grady, do you know what time it -is?

					GRADY
			(looking at his watch)
		I have ...eight-fifteen. That's not right, is 
		it?

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		It's three-thirty, Grady.

					GRADY
		This is important.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Oh? 

					GRADY
		I... I...

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		What is it, Grady?

					GRADY
		I'm in love with your wife.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Excuse me?

					GRADY
		Sara. I'm in love with her.

	Silence. Then Walter's VOICE returns: even, 
	administrative.

					WALTER'S VOICE
		Are you drinking. Professor Tripp? Right now.

	GRADY sips on his roach, responds in a pinched voice.

					GRADY
		No. 

					WALTER'S VOICE
		Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office 
		Monday morning.

	As the line goes dead, GRADY stares at the phone, 
	wondering if he has, in fact, just done what he thinks he's 
	just done.

95	EXT. GRADY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY)

	A CAR rattles down the street, NEWSPAPERS pinwheeling 
	from-the window.

96	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

	A heavy THHNK hits the driveway outside and GRADY blinks. 
	Sitting in his pink robe, bleary-eyed, he reconsiders the 
	piece of paper curling from his typewriter.

	GRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE

	It's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time. 
	Just then, the DISTINCTIVE PURR of an ENGINE is HEARD. 
	GRADY peers through the window, watches a CAB. glide to the 
	curb below. A Citroen DS23. Sara.

97	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE

	GRADY steps onto the porch, unintentionally punting a 
	BOTTLE of Iron City Beer onto the front lawn..

					GRADY
		Sara.

					SARA
		I tried to call, but apparently there's 
		something wrong...

	Sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		...with your phone. Unfortunately, mine was 
		ringing loud and clear this morning.

	GRADY doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure 
	it's not good.

					GRADY
		Oh?

					SARA
		It seems one of our students is - missing and 
		his parents found a dead dog in his bed.

					GRADY
			(slumping to the porch)
		I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. 
		It's all my-

	Sara raises her hand, silencing him.

					SARA
		I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. 
		But more importantly, Walter's not very happy 
		and he's gotten the police involved. They seem 
		to think James Leer is somehow responsible for 
		all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where 
		James is, would you, Grady?

					GRADY
		Inside.

					SARA 
		And the jacket?

					GRADY
		Over there. In the backseat of the...

	Grady's hand hangs in mid-air, gesturing pointlessly to 
	the driveway, where the only thing that exists is an oil 
	stain roughly the shape of North Dakota.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Someone stole my car.

					SARA
		Grady.

					GRADY
		Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it 
		right there last night.

					SARA
		Are you sure you parked it there?

					GRADY
		Of course, I'm sure.  Ah, Christ, the puberty 
		police are back.

	Sara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb.

					SARA
		I'll deal with this. You dig up James.

98	INT. CRABTREE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	CRABTREE sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The 
	Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is the 
	. sole visible part of .James Leer.

					GRADY
			(swinging in)
		Is he awake?

					CRABTREE
		I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.

					GRADY
		Nevertheless. There's a police officer 
		standing on the porch and I don't think he's 
		going away.

					JAMES LEER
			(from under the covers) 
		That same guy?

	CRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one 
	eye.

					JAMES LEER 
		You snore.

					CRABTREE
		So I hear.

					JAMES LEER 
			(studying Grady)
		No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look 
		sorta crappy.

					CRABTREE
		He's right, you look horrible.

					GRADY
		Thank you, Frankie and Annette.

	James swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks 
	bare assed across the room to retrieve his BVDs.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's the Chancellor.

					CRABTREE
		Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.

					GRADY
		And we both thank you for that, but we're... 
		we're... fine.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.

	GRADY squints at James as he pulls on his pants.

					GRADY
		Shut up, James.

					CRABTREE
		So what's the problem?

					GRADY
			(a tad tense)
		There is no problem. Did I say there was a 
		problem?

	As James' head pops through Grady's fully-buttoned 
	flannel, he and CRABTREE
	exchange a knowing glance, at once referring to and 
	excluding Grady.

					SARA (0. S.)
		How's it coming back there, Professor Tripp?

					CRABTREE
		Who's that?

					GRADY
		Who do you think it is?

					CRABTREE
		The Chancellor's here? Now?

					GRADY
		Evidently. 
			(calling)
		Coming!     

					JAMES LEER
		Does she mean--does she know about ...her dog?

					GRADY
		It's Walter's dog and yes, she does. Know. But 
		let's spare her the details. Come on, your 
		shoes are in the hail.

					CRABTREE
		James. This book of yours. It's not bad. Not 
		bad at all.

	James stops, considers this piece of news with a look of 
	deep seriousness, then nods.

					JAMES LEER 
		Thank you.

					CRABTREE
		You're welcome.

	As James shuffles off into the hail, CRABTREE looks at 
	Grady, his eyes dancing with excitement.


					CRABTREE
		I want to publish this.  I've got to.  I think 
		they'll let me.  With a little editorial 
		guidance it could be brilliant. 

					GRADY
		Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out 
		there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been 
		awhile since somebody wrote a good book in 
		jail.

99	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Sara and GRADY stand by as Pete Pupcik deposits James in 
	the back of the squad car, SLAMS the door.

	PUPCIK
	As I told the Chancellor, Professor, I'm. just going to 
	run James here over to the university. It'll be up to Dr. 
	Gaskell where we go from there.

	GRADY nods, leans in the window to James.

					GRADY
		Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		I'm a little worried, James.

					JAMES LEER 
		Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I 
		probably should be expelled.

					GRADY
		Well, let's see if we can keep that from 
		happening.

	James nods and GRADY starts to step back from the car.

					JAMES LEER
		Professor Tripp...?

					GRADY
		Yes, James.

					JAMES LEER
		Even if I end up going to jail....

	James smiles his crooked grin.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		You're still the best teacher I ever had.

	On this,  Pete Pupcik pulls away, leaving GRADY standing 
	on the curb, watching the back of James' head, framed in 
	the rear  window of the police car, growing smaller.

					SARA
		This is not what the university has in mind 
		when it promises a liberal education, Grady.

					GRADY
		Would Walter really press charges?

					SARA
		It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs 
		pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit 
		prickly this morning.

	Grady, detecting something in Sara's tone, turns, watches 
	her take a drag on her cigarette.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		You didn't happen to call the house last 
		night, did you, Grady?

					GRADY
		I think I might have.

					SARA
		And what do you think you might have said?

					GRADY
		I think I might've said I was in love with 
		you.

	Sara's face remains .unchanged.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		He told you.

					SARA 
		He told me.

					GRADY
		And what did you say?

					SARA
		I said it didn't sound like you. 

	Sara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her 
	car, and dives away.  GRADY looks after her sadly, then 
	turns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt 
	which claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away."

					CRABTREE
		So- what do we do now? ,

					GRADY
		Find the jacket.

					CRABTREE
		Oh' huh. Exactly how do we do that?

					GRADY
		First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her 
		car.

					CRABTREE
		It seems to me that girl would let you borrow 
		her pancreas.

100	INT. HANNAH'S ROOM   - 100

	Hannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets, SMILES as she 
	listens to the Goatee Kid, who sits cross-legged at the 
	foot of-her bed, fully clothed.

					GOATEE KID
		I'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent 
		homosexual love. Look at the way they dance--
		it's sodomy.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(laughing) 
		Stop it.

	Hannah looks up, sees GRADY in the doorway and blushes. 
	She pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Grady. Hi. What's up?

	Jeff eases off the bed, past GRADY uneasily.

					GOATEE KID
		I'll be ...somewhere else.

					GRADY
		Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in 
		discussing that business with the tango, try 
		the guy at the end of the hall.

	Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes. GRADY smirks.

					GRADY
		He cribbed that from Borges.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It beats 'What's your major?'

	GRADY nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice.

					GRADY
		Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could 
		borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of 
		commission.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to. 
		..to your book.

	The hitch in Hannah's voice hangs in the room like a 
	cloud.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I uh, I didn't finish, I ...fell asleep.

					GRADY
		That good, hub?

					HANNAH GREEN
		No, it's not that, it's...

	Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her 
	dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It's just that, you know, I was thinking about 
		how, in class, you're always telling us '-that 
		writers make choices--at least the good ones. 
		And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the 
		book isn't really great-I mean, really great-
		but at times it's, well, very detailed, you 
		know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses 
		and ail the dental records and so on-and I 
		don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of 
		reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... 
			(with trepidation)
	...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was 
	wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you 
	wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence.

					GRADY
			(stung)
		Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as 
		shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first 
		writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, 
		it might interest you to know that one book I 
		wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, ' 
		happened to win a little something called the 
		PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under 
		the influence. '

	Hannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately GRADY feels 
	ridiculous. He starts to say something, but instead gathers 
	his manuscript and exits.

101	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER   

	Crabtree, dressed now, studies the freight 'in Grady's 
	arms as he reaches the bottom of the stairs.

					CRABTREE
		Want some help with that?

					GRADY
			(passing by)
		Don't touch it.

102	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT - MOVING  

	CRABTREE sucks on a Kool, driving Hannah's rattling 
	Renault too fast, shifting gears apparently at random. 
	GRADY rides shotgun, still wearing the robe over his 
	clothes, the Wonder Boys manuscript sitting like a 
	watermelon on his lap-looking, all in all, fairly pathetic.

					CRABTREE
		Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes 
		you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his 
		car.

					GRADY
		Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't 
		exactly Jerry's to give.

					CRABTREE
		So whose car is it?

					GRADY
		My guess-Vernon Hardapple.

					CRABTREE
		The hood jumper?

					GRADY
		He said a few things that lead me to believe 
		the car's his.

					CRABTREE
		Such as.

					GRADY
		'That's my car, motherfucker.'

					CRABTREE
		Hh hub. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. 
		We find the car...

					GRADY
		...we find the jacket.

					CRABTREE
		There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know 
		his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we 
		made the whole guy up.

					GRADY
		No wonder he screwed us over.

	CUT TO:

	BILL MAZEROSKI legendary Pittsburgh Pirate second 
	baseman, large as a Macy's Day float, his weathered image 
	scaling three floors on the BRICK face of a RIVERFRONT 
	STOREFRONT.

103	INT. HANNAH'S CAR

	CRABTREE takes a corner recklessly, immediately slows, 
	and blinks in amazement.

					CRABTREE
		Christ, Tripp. How did you know?

					GRADY
		Call it a hunch.

	Parked in front of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS is the white 
	van. A few feet behind, the battered Galaxie.

					CRABTREE
		I'd call it genius.

	GRADY steps out, strips off the robe, and drops the lumpy 
	leviathan that is his manuscript on the front seat.

					GRADY
		It's good to know I'm still talented at 
		something. Keep the motor running.

104	EXT./	INT. GALAXIE    104

	GRADY peers into the backseat, squinting against the WIND 
	that swirls around him. Errol Flynn's face leers back at 
	him. But no jacket. GRADY slides in, pops the glove box, 
	and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County. He pockets it 
	anyway, then spies something else.

	James Leer's little PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL.

	GRADY takes it, rotates it-in his palm. SUNLIGHT GLINTS 
	off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a 
	SWEET, SOFT BLUR...

105	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT 

	CRABTREE stomps on his Kool. GRADY looks very much like a 
	man who has pulled off the road to take a nap.

					CRABTREE
		What the hell...

106	INT. GALAXIE

	As GRADY lolls behind the steering wheel, a CLOUD 
	appears, hovering, then slowly mutates, and GRADY realizes 
	it's not a cloud at all, it's

	MARILYN MONROE standing by the side mirror, wearing a 
	bright pink dress under her wedding jacket.

					MARILYN 
		I know you. . .

	Marilyn's face swims before Grady's eyes, but there's 
	something wrong with it. This girl's eyes are brown and 
	besides, she's ...fat.

					MARILYN (cont'd) 
		Double Dickel on the rocks.

	The last of the fairy dust evaporates and GRADY finds- 
	standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn 
	Monroe's wedding jacket--0ola, the pregnant waitress from 
	the Hi-Hat Club.

					GRADY
		Oola.

					OOLA 
		I never forget a drink.

					GRADY
		I never forget an Oola.

	Suddenly, there is a HEAVY CLICK.

					MAN'S VOICE (0.S.) 
		Forget me?

	GRADY starts to turn, but his head won't  move: largely 
	because the BARREL of a GERMAN NINE is pressed to his 
	temple. Grady's eyes slide.

					GRADY
		Vernon.

					VERNON
			(to Oola)
		Move away, cupcake.  He's got a gun.

					GRADY
		Who's got a gun?

					VERNON 
		You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!

					GRADY
		Relax, Vernon...

					OOLA 
		Why's he calling you Vernon?

					VERNON
		Why's he sitting in my car? He's crazy, that's 
		why. He probably calls everybody Vernon.

					GRADY
		Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. 
		Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon 
		Peabody at Penguin U.K.

					VERNON 
		Shut up. 
			(to Oola)
		Cupcake. Please. Inside.

					OOLA 
		You' re not going to shoot him, are you?

					VERNON
		I'm going to shoot him. If he doesn't put that 
		gun down.

					GRADY
		It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the 
		caps anymore.

					VERNON
		Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And 
		that's a gun.

					GRADY
		No, really....

	GRADY lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled 
	pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead.

107	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT

	CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's 
	arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind.

					CRABTREE
		Holy shit.

108	EXT. KRAVNIKS 

	Vernon stands half-hunched, stunned.

					VERNON 
		Are you crazy!

	The gunshot seems to have cleared Grady's head. He stares 
	at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand.

					VERNON (cont'd)
		Get out! What's the matter with you? Can't you 
		see the condition my girl's in?

	As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on 
	Oola's tummy.

					VERNON 
		You all right, cupcake?

					OOLA 
		Who's Vernon?

	A rude SQUEAL breaks the silence--rubber scratching 
	asphalt--and Grady, Oola, and Vernon turn to see Hannah 
	Green's rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them.

					VERNON 
		What the...?

	Gears GRINDING, tires smoking, CRABTREE fish-tails 
	wildly, then kicks open the passenger door.

					CRABTREE
		Tripp! Run!

	GRADY doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as 
	CRABTREE whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then 
	turns back for another pass.

					VERNON
		Who the hell is that?

					GRADY
		A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon 
		girl's clutch.

	The car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and Crabtree-- 
	swiping aside a flutter of MANUSCRIPT PAGES that have taken 
	flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady, 
	Vernon, and Oola.

					VERNON 
		Woah.

	Vernon steps into the street, levels the German Nine.

					VERNON (cont'd) 
		Pull off, you crazy motherfucker!

	Frantic, GRADY steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and 
	the oncoming Crabtree.

					GRADY
		No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver.

	CRABTREE fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the 
	passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a 
	FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky.

	Only, these ain't birds.  Â - ^

					GRADY
		Oh... my... God! 

	These are PAGES. Seven years of-pages.

	CRABTREE goes into another slide, one-hops the curb, and 
	smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI 
	painted on the front wail of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS.

	As Hannah Green's RADIATOR EXPLODES, CRABTREE steps free 
	of the car and looks skyward. It's a ticker-tape parade ail 
	the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the 
	Ohio River. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
			(to Vernon)
		I take it back.  Shoot him. 

109	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING

	Vernon drives, Oola at his side. In-the back, CRABTREE 
	puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly 
	with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED 
	PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print.

					CRABTREE
		Naturally you have copies.

					GRADY
		I have an alternate version of the first 
		chapter. 

					CRABTREE
		You'll be all right then.  Look at Carlyle, 
		when he lost his luggage.

					GRADY
		That was MacCaulay.

					CRABTREE
		Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those 
		stories.

					GRADY
		He was never able to reproduce them.

					CRABTREE
		Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to 
		depreciate the loss here, but perhaps--in a 
		sense- this--
			(nodding to the pages)
		is for the best.

	Grady's eyes shift, study Crabtree.

					GRADY
		Kind of a sign, you're saying.

					CRABTREE
		In a sense.

					GRADY
		I don't think so. In my experience, signs are 
		usually a lot more subtle.

					VERNON
		Let me get this straight. All that paper that 
		went into the river. That was the only copy?

					GRADY
		'Fraid so.

					VERNON
			(glowering at Crabtree)
		And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What 
		the fuck's the matter with you?

					CRABTREE
		I'm just saying that sometimes, 
		subconsciously, a person will put themselves in 
		a situation-perhaps even create that situation-
		in order to have an arena in which to work out
		an unresolved issue. It's a covert way, if you 
		will, of addressing a problem.

	Vernon stares at CRABTREE as if he's from another planet.

					VERNON
		I'll tell you the problem. You behind the 
		wheel. There's your fucking problem.

					CRABTREE
		That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?

					VERNON
		Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights 
		in the middle of the street none of this 
		happens.

					CRABTREE
		Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun 
		to his head?

					VERNON
		He was trying to steal my car!

					GRADY
		Ail right, all right It's done. There's no 
		need to talk about it. It's done.

	They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns, 
	glances at GRADY
	and his little sheaf of pages.

					OOLA 
		So what was it about? 
			(as GRADY looks up)
		Your book.  What was the story?

	GRADY stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes.

					GRADY
		I don't know...

	Oola's brow wrinkles. CRABTREE glances at his old friend, 
	genuine compassion in his eyes.

					CRABTREE
		What he means is, it's difficult to distill 
		the essence of a book sometimes. It-lives in 
		the mind.

					VERNON
		Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, 
		right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was 
		about, why were you writing it?

					GRADY
		I couldn't stop.

110	EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE

	Grady, James Leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with 
	CRABTREE at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepare 
	to leave in the Galaxie.


					GRADY
		Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?

					VERNON 
		Shoot.

	GRADY glances at little round Oola.

					GRADY
		Boy or girl?

					VERNON
		As long as it looks like her, I don't care. 
		You know what I'm saying?

	GRADY watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead.

					GRADY
		Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

					VERNON
		No sweat. Only do me a favor?

					GRADY
		Sure.

					VERNON 
		Stop calling me Vernon.

	CRABTREE leans into Grady, WHISPERS.

					CRABTREE
		The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...

					OOLA 
		Yea?

	GRADY looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress, 
	snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket.

					GRADY
		It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had 
		small shoulders, like you. Most people don't 
		know that.

	As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head.

					VERNON
		Man, that book of yours must've been one nutty 
		motherfucking ride.

	Vernon points an imaginary gun, fires a friendly cap into 
	Grady, and pulls away. CRABTREE stands stunned.

					CRABTREE
		You mind explaining what you just did?

	GRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping 
	NORDFEST BANNER, lost in thought.

					GRADY
		Came to my senses. CRABTREE

		Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is 
		James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell 
		to come to his?

					GRADY
		Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer 
		to jail, Crabs. I know that.

					CRABTREE
		Do you know he won't expel him?

					GRADY
		No. But I don't think that matters.

					CRABTREE
		That's very enlightened, Professor. It's 
		comforting to know that America's children have 
		you for a teacher.

	GRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the 
	buildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant.

					GRADY
		Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell 
		them what you know. You tell them to find their 
		voice and stick with it, because that's all you 
		have in the end. You tell the ones who have it 
		to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't 
		to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way 
		to get where you're going. 
			(ruefully) 
		Of course, it helps if you know where you want 
		to go. 
			(thoughtfully)
		Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara--
		that's made the last seven years worthwhile.

	GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles 
	cryptically as he considers it. -

					GRADY (cont'd)
		As for James, he doesn't need me anymore...

	Without warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		He's got you.

	CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, 
	watches GRADY walk away.

					CRABTREE
		Me? What can I do?

					GRADY
		Gee, I don't know, Crabs...
			(over his shoulder)
		Improvise. You're good at that.

	GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as 
	he walks toward the buildings in the distance.

					CRABTREE
		I'm sorry, Tripp.

	GRADY stops, turns.

					GRADY
		You peeked, didn't you?

					CRABTREE
		I peeked. 

	GRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter 
	anymore

					CRABTREE
		It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a 
		lot to admire. I've ...never read anything 
		quite like it.

	If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit, 
	Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, 
	and show. And GRADY knows it.

					GRADY
		You're not just trying to make me feel better?

	CRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend.

					CRABTREE
		Scout's honor.

	CRABTREE and GRADY stare into each other's eyes. Both are 
	acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation.

					GRADY
		Well, thanks for that, Crabs.

111	INT. HALLWAY - ENGLISH DEPARTMENT 

	Dead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the 
	stairwell, then GRADY limps into view.

112	INT. GRADY'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks.

	He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two 
	afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill 
	breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the 
	barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-. 
	turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his 
	pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his 
	manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half 
	length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner 
	down into a triangle along the first crease...

113	EXT. QUAD  

	A moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER 
	AIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring 
	then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove.

114	INT. LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER

	GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the 
	auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies 
	Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER.

					GRADY
		Sara!

	Sara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles 
	forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him.

					Q
		Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look 
		at Arsonist's Daughter the other night. There's 
		a description of a bald cypress that left' me 
		breathless.

					GRADY
			(pushing past him)
		Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank 
		teller's breasts in your last one.

115	INT. BACK ROW - AUDITORIUM - THAW HALL

	GRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way 
	behind the back row, scanning the aisles.

					GIRL'S VOICS 
		Hey, Professor Tripp.

	It's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop. 
	GRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat- 
	next to her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the 
		aisle.

					GRADY
		No...

	But GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the 
	aisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming. 
	The Goatee Kid sits close beside her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		Who's that guy she's with? Didn't he used to 
		be in workshop?

					GRADY
		Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango 
		dancers.

116	INT. MAIN STAGE

	Walter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes.

					WALTER
		And now, as those of you who've been with us 
		in previous years know, we have a tradition of 
		sorts here at WordFest. I'm speaking, of 
		course, of The Plums.

	An anticipatory BUZZ sweeps through the audience as 
	Walter begins to read from a separate list.

					WALTER
		This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock, 
		found a publisher for her children's book. The 
		Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.

117	INT. BACK ROW - THAW HALL^

	As a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause, 
	GRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his 
	surprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the 
	front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily 
	complacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing 
	CRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.

					WALTER
		And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for 
		his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has 
		found a home with Putnam for his new Three 
		Rivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.

	A SHORT, BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walter's VOICE 
	takes a shift in tone.

					WALTER
		Now, this next one, I think, is especially 
		exciting to announce, because it concerns a 
		student here at the university. Our own James 
		Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has 
		found a publisher for his first novel, which I 
		believe is called The Lovely Parade.

	GRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile 
	warmly toward the front row. CRABTREE gives James a jab in 
	the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises. Stunned, 
	Carrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY 
		I have a class with him.

	James hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the 
	APPLAUSE slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		The guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know 
		what I mean.

	Grady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups 
	Hi his hands around his mouth.

					GRADY
		Take a bow, James!

	James turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish 
	grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and 
	takes his first sweet public bow.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(softly)
		Wonder Boy.

					WALTER
		And finally--and perhaps not least 
		importantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has 
		also decided to publish my own book--a critical 
		exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and 
		Joe DiMaggio and its function in American 
		mythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled 
		The Last American Marriage.     "

	Wild, obsequious APPLAUSE. GRADY smiles cynically, 
	watches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own.     
	. :

					WALTER 
		Until next year. Thank you, everyone.

	The LIGHTS come up. As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE 
	shakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah 
	Green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms 
	around James.

	GRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when 
	suddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder. She says 
	something congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door. 
	GRADY blinks, scrambles up.

118	INT. CORRIDOR - THAW HALL - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY bursts into the corridor.'

					GRADY
		Sara!

	Its empty. Quiet. GRADY pauses. Somewhere, a HEAVY METAL 
	DOOR CLOSES. GRADY rushes on.

119	INT. NEW CORRIDOR

	Grady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a DOOR. He 
	moves to it, pushes past...

120	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

	...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. He leans 
	out over the railing, peers down. It's a steep drop, very. 
	steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of 
	basement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, and 
	a COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE.

	GRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes 
	against it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his 
	ailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of- 
	marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating 
	atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The 
	SOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're 
	Sara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing.

	It's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.

					GRADY
		Yo, Traxler.

					TRAXLER 
			(looking up)
		Hey, Professor Tripp.

	GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.

					GRADY
		Do you get high, Sam?

					TRAXLER
		Only when I'm working.

	GRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc.  It 
	pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's 
	feet.

					TRAXLER 
		Holy shit. Are you serious?

					GRADY
		As a heart attack.

					TRAXLER
		Thanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here...

	GRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy 
	now. His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on 
	a window ledge-and as he starts to drop...

	...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON 
	caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.

					SARA
		Grady, what are you doing, you idiot?

	GRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face.

					GRADY
		Looking for you.

	He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL 
	GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS...

	faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's 
	name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH 
	upward until we see that she is...

	KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.

121	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue 
	plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the 
	curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips 
	slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW 
	fall outside.

	The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then 
	the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. 
	His NAMETAG says GREENHUT.

					GRADY
		I passed out.

					GREENHUT
		You did.

					GRADY
		I've been doing that a lot lately.

					GREENHUT
		So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of 
		marijuana, I understand.

					GRADY
		Do you think that's why I've been having 
		these...
			(grabbing James' term)
		 ... spells?

					GREENHUT
		How long have you been having them?

					GRADY
		The last month maybe.

					GREENHUT
		How long have you been smoking marijuana?

					GRADY
		Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.

					GREENHUT
		That's probably not the problem, then. What 
		about your lifestyle. Any major changes 
		recently?

					GRADY
		I've been trying to finish a book...

					GREENHUT
		And your wife left you.

					GRADY
		Is that in my chart?

					GREENHUT
		I spoke with the woman who saved your life. 
		You're lucky she came along when she did.

	GRADY considers the larger ramifications of this 
	statement

					GRADY
		I know.

					GREENHUT
			(tapping the glucose bottle)
		You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An 
		internist. And I think you really ought to 
		consider seeing a therapist, as well.

					GRADY
		She told you about. . .

					GREENHUT
		Her dog, yes.

					GRADY
		Actually, it was her husband's dog...

	Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the 
	first time, and GRADY
	stops.

					GREENHUT
		Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all 
		right? On top of that, you have a bite on your 
		ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you 
		with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another 
		day or two and you might have lost the foot. As 
		for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result 
		of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.

					GRADY
		They're anxiety attacks? That's a little 
		disappointing.

					GREENHUT
		Better luck next time.

					GRADY
		So is my friend...is Sara still here?

					GREENHUT
		No. There's no one here.

					GRADY
		I have to see her. As soon as possible.

	Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in 
	his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.

					GREENHUT
		Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave, 
		I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a 
		prescription for a course of ampicillin and I 
		want you to follow it to the end-no matter how 
		stupid you decide to be with everything else. 
		All right?

122	INT. HOSPITAL/BRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON

	GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around 
	him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that 
	connects one building to another.

					GRADY
		I wonder if you could show me something. 

123	EXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES 
	on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple 
	and crazy with veins.

					GRADY
		Are these the only ones you have?

	The nurse's eyes crinkle.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Kidding... 

124	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	GRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER, then turns,     looks at 
	the Gaskell house.

125	EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENT LATER

	GRADY KNOCKS. Nothing. Peers into the living room window.  
	Dark.  He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse, 
	standing ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting 
	onto its roof, melting.

126	EXT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S

	GRADY hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the 
	glass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he 
	pulls away, but not before leaving...

	...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the 
	frost of the glass.

127	EXT. STREET  127

	The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the 
	street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self 
	on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and. 
	..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little 
	pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol, 
	then looks up into the sky.

	GRADY'S POV - of the SKY... 

	...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters 
	the silence.

	NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his 
	hand.

					GRADY
			(as if addressing God) 
		Is that a suggestion?

	GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO 
	SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen 
	DS23 appears.  It passes.  Slows.  Stops. 

	GRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts 
	himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara 
	makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but- 
	not without humor. Then she rolls down the window.

					GRADY
		I'm so glad to see you, Sara.

					SARA
		I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you 
		out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?

					GRADY
		I'm through improvising. 

					SARA
		Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is  it true? 
		Did you lose it all?

					GRADY
		I lost it ail.

					SARA
		Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.

					GRADY
		I know.

					SARA 
		And you're old.

	Sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her 
	fingers. Yanks.

					GRADY
		Ouch. How many?

					SARA 
		Dozens. It's very sad.

	Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes 
	when she looks into his, and-she glances away.

					GRADY
		I went and looked at-some babies just now.

					SARA
		Oh?

					GRADY
			(trying to make her laugh)
		I guess you have to go on faith.

					SARA
			(she doesn't)
		Some times...

	GRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the 
	HOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist.

					GRADY
		Did you tell Walter?

					SARA
		I told Walter. 

					GRADY
		Does he still love you?

					SARA
		It didn't come up. 

	GRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious 
	profile, then turns her chin gently toward him.

					GRADY
		Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I 
		didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been 
		waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're 
		who I need. Because nothing makes sense without 
		you. Because the best moment of every day is 
		the moment I first see your face. And because 
		when you leave a room, there's no reason to be 
		in it any more. It's just a room again.

	Sara cocks her head.

					SARA 
		Did you just make that up?

					GRADY
			(shaking his head)
		In the hospital. I "was kind of excited about 
		it at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy 
		painkillers.

	She frowns good-naturedly. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Even so...it's still true. Every word.

	Sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Sara, I promise, even though commonsense might 
		tell you...

	Sara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...

					SARA 
		Don't write a page when a paragraph will do.

	GRADY nods, takes her hand. Looks at it as he speaks.

					GRADY
		You don't deserve me, you know.

					SARA
		I know, but sometimes... 

	Sara turns, looks at Grady. Her eyes are glistening. 

					SARA (cont'd) 
		You just go on faith.

	GRADY looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too, 
	drifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other 
	side of the car and gets in. As GRADY snaps shut his door, 
	the car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft 
	veil of falling snow. After a moment, GRADY and Sara are 
	lost too, nothing more than a blur.


	THE END
WONDER BOYS

                BASED ON THE NOVEL BY MICHAEL CHABON

                       Screenplay/Steve Kloves

	January 21, 1999 (Pink Revision) 
	January 15, 1999 (Blue Revision) 
	December 18,1998


	All IS A BLUR. . .

	...then WORDS appear, twisting and vaguely transparent, 
	reflected on the window GRADY TRIPP stands before as he 
	reads from a sheaf of NEATLY-TYPED PAGES.

					GRADY
		'The young girl sat perfectly still in the 
		confessional...

1	INT. CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON

	Grady--45-year-old novelist, professor, and insomniac--is 
	in the midst of reading a story to the dozen college 
	STUDENTS who make up his Advanced Writing Workshop.

					GRADY
		...listening to her father's boots scrape like 
		chalk on the ancient steps of the church, then 
		grow faint, then disappear altogether.'

	As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN, 
	perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE 
	BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:

	WELCOME TO WORDFEST

	GRADY turns, peers at his students. They look as if 
	they've been on a field trip to the DMV.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(a wave of the pages) 
		So. .Anyone?

	A GIRL with jet-black hair turns to a PALE YOUNG MAN 
	sitting at a desk in the back of the classroom. He is JAMES 
	LEER, 19. Like GRADY a moment before, he is staring out the 
	window.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY 
		Let me get this straight. The girl with the 
		big lips is depressed because, each night, when 
		her father goes off to work at the bakery, her 
		mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the 
		house. Not only does this girl have to listen 
		to her mother working this guy in the next 
		room, she has to wash the sheets each morning 
		before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of 
		this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy 
		takes her to confession--only, once she gets in 
		the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and 
		realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is 
		that it?

	James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY 
	OVERCOAT he wears.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		I mean, Jesus. What is it with you Catholics?

					GRADY
		All right. Let's try to keep it constructive, 
		shall we? Howard, what about you?

					HOWARD 
		I hated it.

					GRADY
		That's not exactly what I meant by 
		constructive, Howard.

					HOWARD 
		I think James should try to be more 
		constructive. This is my second semester with 
		him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me 
		want to kill myself.

	GRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. 
	Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the 
	raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN. 

					GRADY
		Yes, Hannah?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I think maybe we're missing the point. It 
		seems to me James' strength as a writer is that 
		he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us 
		like adults. He respects us enough to forget 
		us. That takes . . . courage .

	GRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.

					GRADY
		Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I 
		think. 
			(as the students rise) 
		Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And 
		remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to 
		tonight's cocktail party need to have them at 
		the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30.

	Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.

					GRADY
		Thanks for that. He all right?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I think so. ..What about you?

					GRADY
		Me? Sure. Why?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Just checking.

	GRADY watches her glide away in her CRACKED RED COWBOY 
	BOOTS, then starts to exit himself. 

					JAMES LEER 
		Turn out the light, please.

	GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back 
	of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the 
	wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.

2	INT. STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 

	GRADY hurries down the steps, then spies SARA GASKSLL, 
	45, standing below. She is talking to a BOY with an armful 
	of SLICK PROGRAMS.

					SARA 
			(calm but firm) 
		No, Elliot, I said five hundred programs for 
		today. This means we have no programs for the 
		weekend. This means that tomorrow morning, at 
		9AM, several hundred people will walk into Thaw 
		Hall and have absolutely no idea where they are 
		going. 
			(shaking her head) 
		It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it.

	GRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. 
	There is the slightest of hesitations, then....

					SARA 
		Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
		Chancellor.

					SARA 
		I got the message you called.

					GRADY
		I got the message you called too.

	This hangs in the air, awkward somehow, then both nod and 
	continue on, without so much as a backward glance. 

3	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING

	The RADIO BLASTS as GRADY pops the glove box, removes a 
	JOINT as big as his pinky, and wheels his DARK MAROON '66 
	GALAXIE RAGTOP away from campus, cruising under another 
	BANNER:

	WELCOME TO WORDFEST FEBRUARY 26-28

4	EXT. GALAXIE - MOVING.. - PITTSBURGH 

	GRADY cruises past the three rivers and modest 
	skyscrapers of downtown, sipping at the weed. 

5	INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

	GRADY rides the long, automated treadmill that runs half 
	the length of the terminal, until...

6	INT. ARRIVAL GATE - PITTSBURGH AIRPORT

	...TERRY CRABTREE--Grady's editor and friend-exits the 
	tunnel with a STUNNING YOUNG WOMAN in a skin-tight black 
	dress, bright red topcoat, and three-inch spike heels.  
	Grinning devilishly, Crabtree whispers something in the 
	woman's ear, then spots Grady.

					CRABTREE 
		Tripp!

					GRADY
		How are you, Crabtree?

					CRABTREE 
		Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss 
		Antonia. . .uh. . . .

					WOMAN 
		Sloviak.

					CRABTREE 
		I took the liberty of inviting Antonia to 
		tonight's festivities. You don't mind, do you. 
		Trip? ?

					GRADY
			(a slight beat) 
		The more the merrier.

					MISS SLOVIAK 
		Terry was telling me about you on the plane. 
		It was ail so interesting.

					CRABTREE 
		I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes 
		to be published. What you do as a writer, what 
		I do as an editor...

					GRADY
		I sweat blood for five years and he checks for 
		spelling.

					MISS SLOVIAK 
			(indicating Crabtree) 
		That's exactly what he said.

					CRABTREE 
		We know each other pretty well. 
			(to Grady) 
		So where's Emily?

					GRADY
		Emily?

					CRABTREE 
		Your wife.

					GRADY
		Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.

					CRABTREE 
		Perfect. Well then, shall we?

	GRADY nods, but lingers briefly--studying the 
	architecture of Miss Sloviak's ankles as she CLICKS off in 
	her spike heels, arm in arm with Crabtree.

7	INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY and Crabtree watch suitcases tumble as Miss Sloviak 
	sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.

					CRABTREE 
		Do you know how many times I've boarded an 
		airplane praying someone like her would sit 
		down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my 
		way to Pittsburgh.

					GRADY
		Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great 
		cities.

					CRABTREE 
		If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no 
		argument from me.

					GRADY
		She's a transvestite.

					CRABTREE 
		You're stoned.

					GRADY
		She's still a transvestite.

					CRABTREE 
		Mm.

					GRADY
		Isn't she?

	Crabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he 
	watches the carousel spin.

					CRABTREE 
		So how's the book?

	GRADY stiffens. He had been expecting this, but not so 
	soon. He tries to act casual.

					GRADY
		It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort 
		of. ..tinkering with it.

					CRABTREE 
		Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it 
		sometime this weekend. Think that might be 
		possible?

					GRADY
		I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . . 
		juncture .

					CRABTREE
		I thought you were tinkering.

					GRADY
		I just mean. . .

					CRABTREE
		Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, 
		Tripp. But...
			(pointedly)
		 ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?

	GRADY ponders this, troubled by it. Suddenly, Crabtree's 
	face brightens again.

					CRABTREE
		Ah. ..well now. What do you suppose that would 
		be?

	GRADY turns, watches an immense PONY HIDE CASE drop onto 
	the carousel.

					GRADY
		That would be a tuba.

8	INT. GRADY'S CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON                8

	As the Galaxie emerges from a TUNNEL, GRADY watches the 
	great city of Pittsburgh reveal itself in the distance, 
	then glances in the rearview mirror.

					GRADY
		That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It 
		wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Why yes. How did you know?

					GRADY
		Lucky guess.

					CRABTREE
		You didn't actually purchase this car, did 
		you. Trip??

					GRADY
		It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.

					CRABTREE 
		He owes God money. You know, he queered 
		himself for good with Esquire.

	GRADY takes a joint from the ashtray, snaps a Scripto 
	butane.

					GRADY
		He said something about being between things.

					CRABTREE
		Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken 
		legs.

9	EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER  

	A YOUNG WOMAN with a crumpled PITTSBURGH STEEIERS 
	UMBRELLA exits the building and-seeing GRADY parked in 
	front of a fire hydrant--stops, a puzzled expression on her 
	face. As she approaches, GRADY roils down the passenger 
	window.

					GRADY
		Hi, Tanya. 
			(to the others) 
		This is Tanya. My wife's secretary.

	CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and 
	nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.

					TANYA 
		Grady.. ..Emily's not here.

	GRADY just smiles, nods.

					TANYA (cont'd) 
		Is there anything I can do for you?

	GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through 
	Tanya's sad umbrella.

					GRADY
		You're leaking, Tanya.

	Tanya nods--at a loss-then turns away into the rain.

					CRABTREE
		Trip? ?

					GRADY
		She left me. Crabs.

					CRABTREE
		Left you...?  Who? Emily?

					GRADY
		This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.

					CRABTREE
		But. ..why didn't you say something, Tripp? I 
		mean, what are we doing here?

	GRADY gazes at the glittering scene beyond his 
	windshield, turns on the ignition.

					GRADY
		I thought maybe I made it all up.

10	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - EVENING 

	Through the windows, a rabble of writers, faculty and 
	select students can be SEEN, mingling under a haze of 
	cigarette smoke. GRADY brings the Galaxie to a lurching 
	halt across the street, parks in front of another fire 
	hydrant. As the trio steps out. MISS SLOVIAK notices a 
	GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		That's a nice greenhouse.

					GRADY
		It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.

					CRABTREE
		I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, 
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.

					CRABTREE
		Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always 
		do.

11	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GASKELL HOUSE  

	As the front door swings open, Sara Gaskell appears, 
	riding a wave of jagged party CHATTER onto the porch.

					SARA 
		Well, hello, everyone. Terry, good to see you 
		again. 

					CRABTREE
		Chancellor. Don't you look ravishing.

					SARA
		Aren't you sweet to say so. I was beginning to 
		wonder if you were ever going to--oh!

	As Sara steps forward, her heel-catches and she pitches 
	forward ...into Grady's arms.

					GRADY
		Easy there.

					SARA
		I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't 
		know how anyone actually walks in these things.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Practice.

	Sara looks at Miss Sloviak, a faint glitter of scientific 
	curiosity in her eye.

					SARA
		I don't believe we've met...

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Antonia. Antonia Sloviak--

	Just then, a THICKLY-MUCSCLED DOG with very strange EYES 
	skitters around the corner, BARKING SAVAGELY in the general 
	direction of Grady.

					SARA
		Poe!

					CRABTREE
			(mildly)
		This wouldn't be Walter's dog, would it?

	Poe continues to rage, his paws doing crazy eights on the 
	hardwood floor, until he's spun himself completely around 
	and is barking at the living room.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Who ' s he barking at now?

					GRADY
		He's still barking at me. He's blind.

					SARA
		Poe' Hush! Now stop this. Honestly.

	As Poe simmers to a deep growl, GRADY leans forward.

					GRADY
		I need to talk to you.

					SARA
		That's funny. I need to talk to you, too. 
			(strategy in her tone)
		Perhaps you could put some of these coats in 
		the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
			(reading her)
		I don't believe I know where the upstairs 
		guest room is.

					SARA
		Well then. I'd better show you. Terry--

					CRABTREE
		We'll just make ourselves at home.
			(kneeling by Poe) 
		Won't we, Poe? Yes, yes....

12	INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM 

	GRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA. 
	AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of 
	famous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM MAN 
	IN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with 
	PITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. As 
	Sara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S 
	PENNANT hanging over the mantle.

					GRADY
		New?

					SARA 
			(nodding)
		Walter just got it back from the framer today.

	Sara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the 
	pennant and down onto the coat-covered bed.

					SARA 
		You go first.

					GRADY
		All right. This morning--

					SARA 
		I'm pregnant.

	A flash of LAUGHTER flutters from the living  room below. 
	GRADY starts to speak.

					SARA 
		I'm sure.

					GRADY
		Well. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?

					SARA
		I think Walter would find this a little more 
		than surprising.

	GRADY nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back.

					GRADY
		Emily left me this morning.

					SARA
		She's left before...

					GRADY
		She's left the room before. She always came 
		back.

	Sara nods. Considers this.

					SARA
		So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry 
		each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.

					GRADY
		Simple.

	GRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling. Sara sniffs the coat 
	lying beneath her. Miss Sloviak's coat.

					SARA
		Is that Cristaile?

					GRADY
		Hm.

					SARA 
			(weary)
		My God, I wear the same scent as a 
		transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: 
		she?

					GRADY
		If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is 
		by the end of the evening.

					SARA
		Has he asked to see the book yet?

					GRADY
		Yes.

					SARA
		And? Are you going to tell him?

					GRADY
		No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm 
		going to do.

					SARA 
			(distantly) 
		Neither do 1.

	GRADY starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara.

					GRADY
		Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.

					SARA
		I guess you're going to have to chew it off 
		then.

13	INT. LIVING ROOM - GASKELL HOUSE   

	Poe noses blindly through a forest of legs, pauses by 
	Miss Sloviak's high heels and scores a Rye Krisp. Crabtree, 
	returning with a pair of DRINKS, tiptoes around him, finds 
	MISS SLOVIAK chatting with a trim MAN in his 50's.

					CRABTREE
		Walter! I see you've met my friend.

					WALTER GASKELL 
		Yes . She' s charming.

					MISS SLOVIAK
			(taking her drink)
		Walter's been telling me the most fascinating 
		things about Marilyn Monroe and. ..who was it?

					WALTER GASKELL
		Joe DiMaggio. Simply put, Antonia, it' s my 
		contention that their marriage tapped into the 
		very id of American popular culture. Joe 
		DiMaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, 
		the Husband as Slugger.. And, though it may be 
		controversial, I personally believe every 
		woman, in some way, desires to be Marilyn 
		Monroe.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Oh, I couldn't agree more.

	NEW ANGLE

	GRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and 
	changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN 
	("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it's 
	clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting 
	the make on Hannah Green.

					Q
		And while my latest has been on the New York 
		Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't 
		help but lament that my first book, which 
		contains what I consider my finest writing, was 
		remaindered in less than five. So, I find 
		myself conflicted.

					GRADY
		Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in 
		the Hamptons.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(brightening)
		Grady.

	Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass.

					Q 
		Hello.. .Professor.

					GRADY
		Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The 
		Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A' 
		material for her.

	As GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the 
	other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH IN 
	TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN.

					MAN IN TWEED 
			(to short man)
		A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm 
		telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob 
		laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa? 
		Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot 
		bookstore like they need another goddamn cow.
			(as GRADY passes) 
		Grady!

					GRADY
		Hello, Nathan.

					MAN IN TWEED
		My God, I haven't seen you since, what? The 
		PEN/Faulkner Awards. That was a big night for 
		you, Grady.
			(to his friend)
		GRADY was there for Arsonist's Daughter,

	The short man blinks, impulsively takes Grady's hand.

					SHORT MAN
		Douglas Triddly, Amherst. I kid you not when I 
		say Arsonist's Daughter belongs in the pantheon 
		of late twentieth century fiction. I've had it 
		on my Graduate Studies syllabus three years 
		running.

					GRADY
			(pulling away) 
		No wonder it's still in print.

	As GRADY flees, he passes a WOMAN holding a cigarette.

					WOMAN WITH CIGARETTE
		...can take my word for it, writer's are lousy 
		fucks. Poets aren't bad, but then you've got to 
		deal with the sweater thing. They'll discover 
		the cancer in your heart every time, but God 
		forbid they find a decent dry cleaner.

14	EXT. REAR GASKELL HOUSE - NIGHT   

	GRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from 
	his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around 
	the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE 
	accosts him.

					MAN'S VOICE 
		There you are.

	GRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he 
	sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the 
	person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in 
	the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.  

					WALTER
		I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in 
		here. You haven't seen it, have you?

					SARA
		I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if 
		I was sitting on it.

					WALTER
		You'd recognize it if you tasted it.

					SARA
		I doubt it, darling.

					WALTER
			(angling & bottle to the light)
		Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he 
		will be addressing 500 people in little over an 
		hour...

					SARA
		You want to keep him happy.

					WALTER 
		If he' s happy. . .
			(kissing her as he exits) 
		I'm happy.

	As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in 
	the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, 
	she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, 
	returning to the clamor inside her house.

	GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of 
	LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching 
	him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's 
	garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught 
	eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the 
	porch.

					GRADY
		James?

	James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a 
	GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at 
	what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's fake.

	James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY 
	peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The 
	sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED 
	PISTOL.

					JAMES LEER
		It was my mother's. She won it in a penny 
		arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic 
		school.

					GRADY
		It's very convincing.

					JAMES LEER
		It used to shoot these little paper caps, but 
		they don't make them anymore. The caps.

	GRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers 
	and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.

					JAMES LEER
		It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry 
		rabbits' feet...

					GRADY
		...You carry firearms.

	As GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass 
	briefly over the jay. GRADY
	notices, offers.

					JAMES LEER
		No, thank you. I don't like to lose control of 
		my emotions.

	GRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not supposed to be here, in case you were 
		wondering. I crashed. I mean, not 
		intentionally...

	James nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be 
	seen in a window, still fending off the determined Q.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		...but the other night, Hannah and I were 
		together, at the movies, and she asked me. 
		Since she was coming. So I ended up coming. 
		Too.

	GRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.

					GRADY
		Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?

					JAMES LEER 
		No! What gave you that idea?

					GRADY
		Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent 
		her a room.

					JAMES LEER
		She likes old movies like I do, that's ail.
			(glancing back at the window) 
		Besides, she doesn't really know me. She 
		thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's 
		because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.

					GRADY
		Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she 
		knows it and try as she might to not let that 
		screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in 
		some way.

	James looks away from the window, at Grady.

					JAMES LEER
		You're not like my other teachers, Professor 
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		You're not like my other students, James. So 
		what was the movie you two saw?

					JAMES LEER
		Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and 
		Frances Farmer.

					GRADY
		She went crazy, Frances Farmer.

					JAMES LEER
		So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.

					GRADY
		Sounds like a good one.

					JAMES LEER 
			(a crooked smile) 
		It's not bad.

	GRADY considers James' fragile face.

					GRADY
		Listen, James, about this afternoon. In 
		workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a 
		bit out of control.

					JAMES LEER
		They really hated it. I think they hated it 
		more than any of the other ones.

					GRADY
		Well...

					JAMES LEER
		It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to 
		write.

					GRADY
			(truly impressed) 
		Really? That's remarkable.

					JAMES LEER
		I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in 
		bed I figure them out. The stories.

	As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY 
	looks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat. 
	Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against 
	the modest bulk of the cap gun.

					GRADY
		You cold, James?

					JAMES LEER 
			(distant) 
		A little.

					GRADY
		So what are you doing out here?

					JAMES LEER 
		It's colder in there. -

					GRADY
			(laughing) 
		You're right.

	James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that 
	he's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhouse

					JAMES LEER
		Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought 
		...I thought I'd come out here and take a look 
		at it. You don't see one of those every day. It 
		looks like heaven...

					GRADY
		Heaven?

					JAMES LEER
		I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in 
		heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in 
		crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the 
		way I remember it...

	Abruptly, James glances at his watch.

					JAMES LEER 
		I should be going.

	James turns away, then stops. He stands like this a 
	moment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		Goodbye, Professor Tripp.

	GRADY hesitates, then shakes James' hand. James moves off 
	then, leaving the light of the house behind.

					GRADY
		James. 
			(as he stops)
		Don't leave just yet. There's something I 
		think you ought to see.

					JAMES LEER 
		I'll miss my bus.

					GRADY
		This is worth it.

	James looks conflicted.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Trust me.

15	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER  

	It's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks James past 
	the departing guests and toward the stairs.        

					HANNAH GREEN
		Hey, you two.

	GRADY stops, sees Hannah slipping on a coat in the foyer.

					HANNAH GREEN (cont'd) 
		Are you riding with me, James?

					JAMES LEER 
		No, I'm going ho--

					GRADY
		He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his 
		friend. All right?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Ail right. By the way, his friend...?

					GRADY
		The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. 
		Where are they exactly?

					CRABTREE
		Here we are!

	CRABTREE appears at the top of the landing with Miss 
	Sloviak. Her lipstick is blurry.

					CRABTREE
			(spying James) 
		Nell, hello there.

	CRABTREE steps down the stairs, hand extended. James 
	Leer's pale fingers rise as if on a string.

					GRADY
		James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.

					HANNAH GREEN
		James'll know about George Sanders.

					JAMES LEER 
		George Sanders?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Mr. CRABTREE was saying how George Sanders 
		killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.

					JAMES LEER
		Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel 
		room.

	The few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but 
	Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.

					CRABTREE
		How comprehensive of you.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Oh, James is amazing. He knows all the movie 
		suicides. Go ahead, James. Tell them who else.

					JAMES LEER 
		There's so many...

					HANNAH GREEN
		Just a few then. The big ones.

	James glances at the loose group of people around him, 
	watching, then...

					JAMES LEER
		Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles 
		Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 
		1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an 
		accident, but, you know. . . 
			(a trace of irony)
		He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took 
		pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he 
		hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in 
		lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more 
		pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget 
		when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot 
		himself. Jean Seberg/ pills of course, 1979. 
		Everett Sioane-- he was good--pills. Margaret 
		Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. 
		Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 
		1978. There are more but I don't know if you 
		would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara 
		Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I haven't heard of half of those.

					CRABTREE
		You did them alphabetically.

	James turns, finds Crabtree's laser eyes on him. James 
	blinks, as if he had forgotten about Crabtree, then shrugs 
	shyly, looks away.

					JAMES LEER
		That's just how my brain works, I guess.

					CRABTREE
		Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out 
		with us after the lecture. There's a place on 
		the Hill I always get Trip to take me.

					JAMES LEER
		Actually. ..I just want to go home.

					CRABTREE
		Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants 
		to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. 
		Just think of it as a field trip.

	As he exits, CRABTREE raises an eyebrow to Grady, as if 
	to say: "Bring him."   MISS SLOVIAK follows, eyeing James 
	glacially as we CUT TO:

	BLACK

	The dull PURR of a COMBINATION LOCK is HEARD, a DOOR 
	opens, and a triangle of LIGHT falls on a PHOTOGRAPH of 
	MARILYN MONROES JOE DIMAGGIO on their wedding day.

16	INT. CLOSET - GASKELL HOUSE   

	GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the 
	photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN-
	STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SATIN 
	JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.

					JAMES LEER 
		Is that really it?

					GRADY
		That's really it.

					JAMES LEER
		The one she wore on her wedding day?

					GRADY
		So I'm told.

	James, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide 
	garments, stands speechless.

					GRADY
			(cont'd) 
		Go ahead.

					JAMES LEER 
		Really?

					GRADY
		Really.

	James swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he 
	reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar, 
	barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust.

					JAMES LEER
		They're glass. The buttons.

					GRADY
		Like the lady herself.

	GRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a 
	bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the 
	jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.

					JAMES LEER
		She was small. Most people don't know that. 
		The shoulders are small.
			(touching the satin)
		It looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time 
		she wore it. That day. She must've felt so 
		...happy.

	GRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket, 
	lifts it lightly.

					JAMES LEER
		It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... 
		something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.

					GRADY
		I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth 
		about how much he pays for these things.

					JAMES LEER
		You're really good friends with the 
		Chancellor, aren't you?

	Grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains 
	unchanged, consumed with the jacket.

					GRADY
			(carefully)
		Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, 
		too.

					JAMES LEER
		I guess you must be, if you know the 
		combination to his closet and he doesn't mind 
		your being here in their bedroom like this.

					GRADY
		Right.

	A DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The 
	CLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom 
	window, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN 
	DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.

					GRADY
		We, better skedaddle. Close that closet-- 
		James? You ail right?

	James is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed, 
	knapsack between his knees, head in hands.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing 
		that jacket that belonged to her. It just 
		looks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a 
		closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.

					GRADY
		Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself 
		tonight.

					JAMES LEER 
		You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail? 
			(off Grady's look)
		Hannah mentioned something about it.   About a 
		note.

					GRADY
		Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we 
		should go now.

	Without thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light, 
	leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today.

	James just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.

17	INT. HALLWAY

	A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY
	as he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to 
	the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in 
	Grady's direction.

					GRADY
		Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . .

	GRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward 
	and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle.

					GRADY
		Jesus!

	GRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the 
	ground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls his 
	head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy heap.

					GRADY
		Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch!

	Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his 
	head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, 
	growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his 
	throat, until there is a sharp...

	CRACK! CRACK!

	Poe YELPS, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily 
	onto Grady's legs. GRADY
	turns. James Leer stands in the doorway, posed with the 
	little pearl-handled pistol like Steve McQueen.

	GRADY looks at James. Then Poe. Then back to James.

					GRADY
		Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.

					JAMES LEER 
		I had to. Didn't I?

					GRADY
		Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?

					JAMES LEER
		No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1 
		thought --

					GRADY
		Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on 
		me.

	GRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through 
	life with a slight overbite.

					JAMES LEER
		Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see 
		if someone's breathing.

					GRADY
		He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead 
		dog when I see one.

	James looks miserably at Poe.

					JAMES LEER
		What are we going to do?

	GRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.

					GRADY
		First you're going to give me that little cap 
		gun of yours.

18	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING 

	GRADY and James stare gloomily out the windshield.

					JAMES LEER
		Professor Tripp? Can I  ask you a question?

					GRADY
		Yea, James.

					JAMES LEER 
		What are we going to do with...

	James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange 
	blue eyes gleaming.

					GRADY
		I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out 
		how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her 
		husband's dog.

					JAMES LEER
		You?

					GRADY
		Trust me, James, when the family pet's been 
		assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear 
		one of her students was the triggerman.

					JAMES LEER
		Does she want to hear it was one of her 
		professors?

					GRADY
		I've got tenure.

19	EXT. PARKING LOT -- THAW HALL (CAMPUS) 

	As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of 
	Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates a 
	space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.

					GRADY
		Okay.

	James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs 
	looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps 
	forward, and takes the hind legs.

					JAMES LEER
		He's still a little warm.

	They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until 
	there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.

					JAMES LEER 
		Yuck.

	GRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.

					JAMES LEER 
		That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a 
		suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost 
		perfectly.

					GRADY
			(searching)
		That's just what they used to say in the ads. 
		Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...

					JAMES LEER
		Whose tuba is that anyway? 

					GRADY
		Miss Sloviak's.

					JAMES LEER
		Can I ask you something about her?

					GRADY
		She is. Ah. Here we go...

	GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane-
	size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of 
	boxers.

					JAMES LEER
		Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he--
		gay?

					GRADY
		Most of the time he is, James. Some of the 
		time he isn't. Now what do we have here?

	GRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a 
	pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.

					GRADY
		Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That 
		should take the pinch out of my ankle.
			(handing the bottle to James) 
		Have one.

					JAMES LEER
		No thanks. I'm fine without them.

					GRADY
		Right. That's why you were standing in the 
		Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap 
		gun of yours tonight.  You're fine, all right, 
		you're fit as a fucking fiddle.

	GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth, 
	drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James.

					GRADY
		I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that.

	Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, 
	and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second later, 
	he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pill 
	from the lapel of his jacket.

					GRADY
		How 'bout we try that again.

20	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

	On the stage. Walter Gaskell stands alone at a podium.

					WALTER
		...really needs no introduction. Walk down the 
		aisle of any airplane or by the pool of any 
		hotel and you'll see his face beaming back at 
		you. You all know the name, you all know the 
		books, so welcome if you will, the man those of 
		us who know him simply call.. .Q.

	As the audience THUNDERS, GRADY and James slink into the 
	auditorium. It's standing room only. As they head for an 
	open space against the back wail, GRADY squeezes past a KID 
	with a GOATEE .who regards him warily.
 
					Q 
		Good evening.

	GRADY stares, over the gleaming sea of heads before him, 
	watching as Q pauses, ..for a very long moment... waiting 
	until the auditorium is consumed in a heavy, anticipatory 
	hush. Finally, he speaks again.

					Q 
		I am a writer.

	As the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He 
	glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a 
	similar look of bafflement.

					Q (cont'd)
		As a writer, one thing you learn is that 
		everyone you encounter has a story. Every 
		bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an 
		idea or a. story that would make a "great book" 
		or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has 
		an idea. (gestures to the audience)
		But, how do you go from there to here? How do 
		you go from having an idea to having a book? 
		How do you get across? What is the bridge, the 
		bridge that allows you to walk on air from the 
		shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of 
		accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is 
		worth the telling, faith that you have the 
		wherewithal to tell it, faith that the 
		carefully woven structure you create won't 
		collapse beneath you...

	GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking 
	and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far 
	EXIT. A blink later, she is gone.

					Q (cont'd)
		...and faith that when you get to the other 
		side someone will be waiting who gives a damn 
		about the tale you have to tell.

	GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own 
	HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a 
	thread forty feet above his head...

	Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: 
	bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the 
	auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, 
	James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows 
	away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady.

	GRADY blinks, turns to James.

					GRADY
		I'll be right back.

21	INT. LOBBY

	GRADY bursts through the auditorium doors and into the 
	lobby. A PAIR. of local BOOKSELLERS, chatting quietly 
	behind a table arrayed with the BOOKS of attending authors, 
	glance up as GRADY limps toward the restrooms. 

22	INT. CORRIDOR  

	GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor 
	begins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his 
	cheek against the cool...cool...wall. ..as...ail..-goes....

	BLACK FOR A 

	MOMENT AND THEN....

					SARA'S VOICE 
		Grady? Grady?

	GRADY opens his eyes, finds Sara's face swimming above 
	him. He is lying on his back in the corridor, his corduroy 
	blazer bundled under his head like a pillow.

					SARA
		You had another one, didn't you? You have to 
		see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday 
		morning. All right?

					GRADY
		Is the thing-is it over?

					SARA 
		Almost. Wane to sit up?
			(as he winces) 
		What's the matter?

					GRADY
		Nothing. I think I twisted my--

	GRADY looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt.

					GRADY
		I have to tell you something. Something.. 
		.hard.

	Sara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque.

					SARA
		Then stand up. I'm too old for all this 
		roiling around on the floor.

	GRADY lets her pull him up, watches her light a 
	cigarette.

					GRADY
		Well...

					SARA
		Don't. I know what you're going to say.

					GRADY
		No, really, Sara, I don't think you--

					SARA
		You love Emily. I know that. And you need to 
		stay with her.

					GRADY
		I don't think I really have a choice in, that. 
		Emily left me.

					SARA
		She'll come back. That's why I'm going to. 
		..to not have this baby.

	GRADY watches her flip her hand up, bring the cigarette 
	to her lips, and inhale ...then grimace and drop it to the 
	floor.

					GRADY
		Not have it.

					SARA
		No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think 
		there's no way?

					GRADY
		Well, no, I don't see any way.
			(taking her hand)
		And I know how hard it is for you to-- to lose 
		this chance.

					SARA
			(jerking away)
		No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. 
		And fuck you for "saying. . .
			(quietly)
		...for saying there's just no way. Because 
		there could be a way, Grady.

	Somewhere deep in the building, APPLAUSE swells.

					SARA
			(composing herself)
		He must be finishing. We should go.

	GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his 
	coat.  As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTERS 
	to the floor.

					SARA
		Who's gun is that?

					GRADY
		It's-it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

	Before GRADY can close his hand, Sara has it in her own.

					SARA
		Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.

					GRADY
		Caps.

	She points it-at Grady's chest. He smiles nervously.

					SARA 
		Pow.

					GRADY
		You got me.

					SARA
		I love you, Grady.

	GRADY places his fingers gently over Sara's... and 
	removes the gun from her hand.

					GRADY
		I love you, too.

23	INT. LOBBY 

	The auditorium doors swing open and James Leer emerges, 
	arms draped over CRABTREE and a LARGE STUDENT.

					JAMES LEER
		Woah! The doors made so much noise!

	As they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear.

					JAMES LEER
		This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry 
		me out.

					GRADY
		Is he ail right?

					CRABTREE
			(rolling his eyes) 
		He's fine. He's narrating.

					JAMES LEER 
		We're going to the men's room. Only we might 
		not make it in time.

					SARA
		Terry CRABTREE and James Leer. Leave it to you 
		to make that mistake, wait here.

	As Sara heads off after James, GRADY turns toward the 
	lobby...directly into the hostile gaze of Miss Sloviak.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		I need a ride.

					GRADY
		I'm your man.

24	EXT. STREET 24

	As the Galaxie's big trunk yawns open. MISS SLOVIAK 
	stares at what's wedged up against her suitcase.

					GRADY
		There's an explanation.

	MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in, 
	unzips her suitcase.

25	INT.    GRADY'S CAR - MOVING   

	As GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top 
	button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered 
	COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the 
	glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAIL 
	POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the 
		poor thing?

					GRADY
		James is. ..I don't know...

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Disturbed. And when your friend CRABTREE gets 
		done with him, he's going to be even more 
		disturbed.

					GRADY
		I'm not sure that's possible.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Sure it is.

	GRADY watches MISS SLOVIAK peel the wig from her 
	forehead.

					GRADY
		Listen, Antonia--

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Tony. Now that I'm home.

					GRADY
		Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so 
		well for you tonight. With Terry.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Forget it. I should've known better. Your 
		friend is just, I don't know, into collecting 
		weird tricks. Mind?

	Tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself.

					GRADY
		He's writing his name in water.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		What's that?

					GRADY
		Like most editors, he really wants to be a 
		writer, but he's too busy living a novel to 
		bother writing one.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a 
		shit.

					GRADY
		He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the 
		feeling he's going through the motions a bit.

	Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		You mean because his career's ruined and all?

					GRADY
		Jesus. Is that what he told you?

					MISS SLOVIAK
		He said he hasn't had a success in ten years 
		and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of 
		.a. . .

	As Tony re-sets the rearview mirror, GRADY gets a glimpse 
	of his own swollen eyes.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		...loser. But I'm sure your book is so good 
		that he'll be able to keep his job.

	Hearing this, GRADY looks troubled. MISS SLOVIAK points.

					MISS SLOVIAK
			(cont'd) 
		Turn here.

26	EXT. SLOVIAK HOUSE

	GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front 
	lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a 
	little white BAND SHELL painted with stars.

					GRADY
		That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese 
		beetle trap.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.

	The PORCH LIGHT conies on and a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN 
	squints through the screen door.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		There's Pop. 
			(turning)
		Let me see it. The gun.

	GRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony 
	smirks.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		Figures. It's like the kind of gun Bette Davis 
		would carry. In a little beaded purse?

	GRADY studies the gun in Tony's hand, then glances at the 
	front screen door. Pop is still there.

					GRADY
		I'd better go. I think I may have to rescue 
		James Leer.

	MISS SLOVIAK returns the gun, .steps out of the car, and 
	peers in at Grady.

					MISS SLOVIAK
		You know, Grady, if I were you. I'd think 
		about going home. You look like you need a 
		little rescuing yourself.

27	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB 

	GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS 
	stenciled on the side. He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patron 
	in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then 
	slides -James Leer's little PISTOL into the glovebox.

27A	EXT. ENTRANCE - HI-HAT CLUB     

	As GRADY steps to the door, the bouncer gives him a 
	perfunctory pat-down.

					BOUNCER 
			(kidding him) 
		Clean tonight, hub, Professor?

					GRADY
		As a whistle.

28	INT. HI-HAT CLUB

	Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY 
	enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She beckons 
	with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her 
	glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated 
	shrug and she points.

	CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James 
	slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the 
	general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneath 
	the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap.

	Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing 
	WAITRESS.

					GRADY
		Double Dickel on the rocks.

29	INT. BOOTH 

	As GRADY arrives, CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately 
	and James' eyes flutter open .briefly, ..then close.

					GRADY
		Is that just beer?

					CRABTREE
		Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a 
		little raid on the CRABTREE pharmacopoeia. You 
		missed a few bottles, by the way.

					GRADY
		I'm sure. Where is everyone?

					CRABTREE
		Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to 
		go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.

	GRADY cuts James a glance, trying to determine if he's 
	copped on Poe, but James is winking out. His head drifts 
	back against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk.

					GRADY
		Jesus. He's out.

	CRABTREE glances over, nods.

					CRABTREE
		He has a book.

					GRADY
		I know. He started it Fall semester.

					CRABTREE
		He finished it Winter Break.

	GRADY looks up, unable to disguise his surprise.  He 
	glances at James' slack face tilted against the wall.

					CRABTREE
		So. Is he any good?

					GRADY
		No. Not yet he isn't.

					CRABTREE
		Well, I'm going to read it anyway.

					GRADY
		Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one oÂ£ 
		my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure 
		if he's-

					CRABTREE
		He is. Take my word for it.

					GRADY
		I think it's more complicated than that. 
		Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost 
		...did something stupid tonight. At least, I 
		think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual 
		confusion thrown into the stew right now.

					CRABTREE
		On the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.

					WAITRESS 
			(ducking in) 
		Double Dickel.

					GRADY
		Thanks.

	GRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes 
	she is conspicuously PREGNANT. He watches her disappear 
	beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah 
	Green's slinky form seizes his attention.

					CRABTREE
		No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?

					GRADY
		Shut up and drink.

	CRABTREE grins, brings his bottle up, then stops.

					CRABTREE
		Oh my goodness. Do you see what I see?

	GRADY follows Crabtree's glance and finds Oola again, but 
	it's not Oola CRABTREE
	is eyeing, it's her CUSTOMER.

					GRADY 
		President of the James Brown Hair Club For 
		Men.

	Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with 
	big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most 
	noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.

					GRADY
			(initiating an old game) 
		He's a boxer. A flyweight.

					CRABTREE
		Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis.. 
		.Curtis Hardapple.

					GRADY
		Not Curtis.

					CRABTREE
		Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are 
		from a--from a horse. He fell during a race and 
		got trampled.

					GRADY
		And now he's addicted to painkillers.

					CRABTREE
		He can't piss standing up anymore.

					GRADY
		He lives with his mother.

					CRABTREE
		And he had a younger brother who . . .was . . 
		. a. . .

					GRADY
		Groom. Named Claudell.  And his mother blames 
		Vernon for his death.

					CRABTREE
			(stumped)
		Because. . .because. . .

					JAMES LEER 
			(sleepily)
		.. .he was killed, when a gangster named 
		Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite 
		horse. He took the bullet himself.

	GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens 
	one bloodshot eye to regard them.

					JAMES LEER
		Vernon, over there, was in on the hit.

	James' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady.

					CRABTREE
		That was good.

					GRADY
		He heard everything we were saying.

	Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Come on. Teach. I want you to dance with me.

30	INT. DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          30

	GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the 
	jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a 
	sexy, measured blues.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's 
		so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like ail 
		your sentences always existed, just waiting 
		around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to 
		fetch them down.

					GRADY
		I thank you.

					HANNAH GREEN
		And I love the inscription you wrote to me. 
		Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think 
		I am.

					GRADY
		I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy 
		innocents we can get.

	GRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say 
	something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair 
	from James Leer's forehead.

					HANNAH GREEN
		So what are you going to do?

					GRADY
		Do?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I just mean, I--I guess Emily isn't going to 
		be there when you get home.

	GRADY looks down into Hannah's translucent face, then 
	catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. The 
	tile that would reflect his head is missing.

					GRADY
		Are you holding me up or am I dragging you 
		down?

	Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Shush.

31	EXT. PARKING LOT - HI-HAT CLUB (2 AM)       

	Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to 
	Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender.

					GRADY
		Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make 
		sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I would if I knew where I was taking him.

					GRADY
		Hannah, are you telling me you don't know 
		where James Leer lives?

					HANNAH GREEN
		Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen 
		it.

					GRADY
		That strikes me as odd.

					HANNAH GREEN
		James is odd. I know he has an aunt in 
		Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, 
		but... 
			(remembering)
		Come to think of it, it-wasn't even his Aunt's 
		house. He said she worked there. Or something. 
		I don't remember.

	James MUMBLES, starts to slide onto the hood of the car.

					JAMES LEER 
		Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap....

					GRADY
		What's he saying?

					HANNAH GREEN
		His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's 
		always carrying around. He must've left it 
		inside.

					GRADY
		Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...

	GRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street. 
	CRABTREE
	and Q huddle inside.

					GRADY
		Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the 
		auditorium.

					JAMES LEER
			(delirious, but insistent) 
		Mmrrmmm.. .KNAP SAP!

	GRADY frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		All right. Take him to my place. He can crash 
		on the sofa.

					HANNAH GREEN
		The one in your office? It's the best one .for 
		naps.

					GRADY
		I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We 
		could probably stand him up in the garage with 
		the snow shovels at this point.

	As GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls 
	into a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady.

					GRADY
		Ail right. In my office.

	As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his 
	face.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Hey. If you want to talk later...I'll be up.

	GRADY watches her fold her lovely self into the car and 
	drive away. He sighs, crosses to the Galaxie, and just has 
	his hand on the doorhandle when a TINY FIGURE appears.

	Vernon Hardapple.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		You driving this car?

					GRADY
		Excuse me?

					VERNON HARDAPPLE
		This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving 
		this car?

					GRADY
		It's mine.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.

					GRADY
		You must be mistaken.

					VERNON HARDAPPLE 
		Bullshit.

	GRADY shakes his head wearily, opens the door.

					GRADY
		Go home to your mother, Vernon.

32	INT. GALAXIE      

	GRADY slides in next to Q, puts the car in gear, and 
	starts to pull away. As he glances in the rearview, he sees 
	CRABTREE smiling darkly in the backseat.

					GRADY

		All right, what's the matter?

	CRABTREE just keeps smiling.

					GRADY
		Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? 
		The kid's practically in a coma.

					CRABTREE
		Tripp.

					GRADY
		Yes.

					CRABTREE
		Hit your brakes.

	GRADY flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a 
	SHADOW looms in his headlights. As he squashes the break 
	pedal, Q's EYEGLASSES go flying into the windshield.

					Q 
			(squinting)
		Oh my God! What is that?

	It's Vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the 
	beams of light.

					GRADY
		What's this guy's problem?

					CRABTREE
		Just go around him.

	GRADY taps the accelerator, but each time, Vernon dances 
	back in front of Grady's grille.

					GRADY
		Shit.

					CRABTREE
		Back up. Go out the other way.

	GRADY throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then 
	turns up a one-way street. He shoots down the alley behind 
	the Hi-Hat, turns onto the adjoining street, ..and watches 
	in amazement as Vernon materializes from behind the high 
	wooden fence that runs parallel to the Galaxie.

	As GRADY pinches the brakes, Vernon grins.

					GRADY
		Now what?

					Q
			(mischievously)
		You could always go over him.

	Then, as the three men watch, Vernon rocks back on his 
	heels and--with a gymnast's precision-pitches himself onto 
	the Galaxie's big hood. He -lands on his ass, slides 
	smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the 
	night.

					Q 
		What just happened?

	GRADY peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood.

					GRADY
		I just had my car jumped on.

33	EXT. THAW HAIL - NIGHT (TWENTY MINUTES LATER) 

	Grady stops the car in the red zone and gets out.

					GRADY
		Wait here. I'll be right back.

					CRABTREE
		Where would we go?

34	INT. LOBBY   

	The JANITOR, the same shaggy-haired kid GRADY saw rigging 
	the WordFest banner earlier, is struggling with a balky 
	FLOOR WAXER as GRADY steps up to the double doors and slaps 
	his hand against the glass.

					JANITOR 
		It's open.

	GRADY pushes on the door and it opens.

					JANITOR (cont'd) 
		Hey, Professor Tripp. 
			(off Grady's look)
		Traxler. Sam. I took your class freshman year. 
		Then I dropped out of school.

					GRADY
		I hope it wasn't my fault.

					TRAXLER
			(taking him seriously)
		No. I guess you're here for the backpack. 

					GRADY
		Oh.. .yeah.

35	INT. AUDITORIUM       

	The knapsack is sitting on one of the metal folding 
	chairs as Sam and GRADYenter the silent hail.


					TRAXLER
		I saw the manuscript inside. So when you 
		showed up, I figured. . .

	GRADY lifts the knapsack, peers inside. There is no title 
	page to the MANUSCRIPT, Just the words The Love Parade and 
	then, halfway down, TEXT.

					TRAXLER 
		Is it good?

					GRADY
			(reading)
		I don't know. It might be...

36     CUT

37	EXT. THAW HALL - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER 

	GRADY steps outside, closes the flap of the knapsack and, 
	hunching his shoulders against the cold... stops.

	Crabtree. Q. The car. Gone. 

38	INT. TRAXLER'S HONDA - NIGHT   

	Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the 
	original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The 
	backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR.

					TRAXLER
		Say, Professor Tripp, is ail that stuff true 
		about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on 
		his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last 
		longer?

					GRADY
		Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?

					TRAXLER 
		Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, 
		aren't you?

	Sam points and GRADY glances at the knapsack riding on 
	the seat between him and Sam. A BOOK'-bearing ERROL FLYNN'S 
	PICTURE--IS tucked into the side pouch.

					GRADY
		Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub 
		ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground 
		lamb.

					TRAXLER 
		Sick.

39	EXT. SASKELL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

	Sam brings the car to a coughing idle across the street 
	from the Gaskell's house.

					TRAXLER
		Wow, check out that greenhouse. Is that your 
		wife?

	GRADY gazes at Sara, a .vaporous blur in the greenhouse.

					GRADY
		No, my wife's out of town.

	Just then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom, 
	then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway. 
	Walter appears on the front steps.

					TRAXLER (cont'd) 
		Who's that guy?

					GRADY
		Her husband.

	Traxler looks anxiously at the police car.

					TRAXLER
		What exactly are we doing here, Professor 
		Tripp?

					GRADY
			(staring at Sara) 
		Taking the long way home.

39A	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER

	As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James 
	Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches above 
	the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away with 
	only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. He 
	takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.

40	INT. .HALLWAY - GRADY'S HOUSE

	GRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him.

41	INT. LIVING ROOM     

	The room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes 
	of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, he 
	finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T-
	shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling 
	hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet 
	Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, but 
	his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He 
	steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his 
	disappointment--only the red cowboy boots.

	He picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits.

42	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

	James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old 
	sleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James' 
	knapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects 
	his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack.

	Something yellow. Something soft.

	GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing 
	a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET 
	from James Leer's ratty green knapsack. 

	GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking 
	very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the 
	light on the both of them.

43	EXT. FRONT PORCH - SATURDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY) 

	GRADY steps outside in a WOMAN'S CHENILLE BATHROBE and 
	plucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch 
	step. He fishes out a charred ROACH, starts to light it, 
	then notices the Galaxie sitting in the driveway.

44	INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER     

	As CRABTREE SNORES thunderously, GRADY eases open the 
	door, spots the CAR KEYS on the dresser, grabs them.

44A	INT. LANDING - CONTINUOUS

	GRADY eases the door shut, starts to turn, then stops, 
	his eyes drawn to the door just across the landing from 
	Crabtree's room.

44B	INT. EMILY'S OFFICE 

	GRADY pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers, 
	lets it glide open. The room that is revealed is bright and 
	well-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of 
	Grady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER, 
	pads and pens neatly arranged alongside.

	A BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate 
	mosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS, 
	framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's 
	DHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's 
	Daughter.

	There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck 
	with friends. In a sundress with Grady. In a billowing 
	Burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a BLUR of 
	YELLOW TAXIS on a street in Manhattan.

	Smiling brilliantly. Beautiful.

45	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE

	GRADY enters with a THERMOS--pauses--redistributes the 
	sleeping bag over James Leer's pale body.

					JAMES LEER 
			(without waking) 
		Thank you.

					GRADY
		You're welcome.

	GRADY sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee 
	from the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the center 
	of a galaxy of previous coffee rings. Next, he takes a 
	clean piece of paper, balls it up, and-with ritual 
	precision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP 
	that crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room.

	All net.

	A 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and, without 
	further ceremony, GRADY
	turns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC 
	and SPACES to the top right corner, TYPES:

		(beat) 2611

	In other words: Page 2611.

	CLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS, 
	the KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that 
	grows and grows until, finally, it just ....Stops.

					GRADY
		James I  

	GRADY awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's 
	quizzical face floating like a cloud above him.

					GRADY
		I'm okay. I just lost my balance.

					JAMES LEER 
		I put you on the floor.

					GRADY
		Oh.

					JAMES LEER
		I thought you might--l don't know-- swallow 
		your tongue or something.
			(nodding to Grady's robe)
		I guess you really miss her, huh?

	GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets 
	of the robe, its overall fuzziness.

					GRADY
		Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write 
		in it.

					JAMES LEER
		I guess there's probably a story behind that.

					GRADY
		There is, but it's not that interesting.

	James nods. Down the hallway, in another room, the 
	TELEPHONE RINGS.

					JAMES LEER 
		Want me to get that?

					GRADY
		Sure.

	As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises 
	delicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to 
	see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.

					JAMES LEER 
			(returning)
		He didn't give his name.

					GRADY
		Who?

					JAMES LEER 
		The guy on the phone.

					GRADY
		What'd he say?

					JAMES LEER
		He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here 
		and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 
		with black interior.

					GRADY
		What'd you tell him?

					JAMES LEER
		Yes.

					GRADY
		Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be 
		sure to mention the back door pops open with a 
		couple hard shakes to the right.

					JAMES LEER
		I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or 
		something. Is that single-spaced?

	James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on 
	Grady's desk.

					GRADY
		Afraid so.

					JAMES LEER
		That's a big book you're writing.

					GRADY
		I think it's sort of writing itself at this 
		point.

					JAMES LEER
		Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, 
		but--

					GRADY
		But . . . ?

					JAMES LEER
		Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been 
		awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some 
		people--some of the kids in workshop--thought 
		maybe you were...

					GRADY
		Washed up?

					JAMES LEER 
		Blocked.

					GRADY
		Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.

	James takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.

					JAMES LEER
		No kidding.

	A LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch 
	Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers, 
	materialize in the hallway.

					CRABTREE
		Good morning, boys. James.

	James waves feebly from beneath the sleeping bag.

					GRADY
			(re: James' "attire") 
		If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast, 
		I'd put on something a little less comfortable 
		if I were you.

	As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the 
	page curling from the typewriter, James continues to stare 
	into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE 
	seems to have made him suddenly queasy.

					JAMES LEER 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Hm.

					JAMES LEER 
		How did I get here last night?

					GRADY
		No one seems to know where you live, James. 
		Hannah thought you'd like my couch.

					JAMES LEER
		And ...and before that. Did I do anything? 
		Anything bad?

					GRADY
		Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the 
		English Department's dog and steal his most 
		prized piece of memorabilia.

	As James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY 
	looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now 
	parked at the bottom of his driveway.

					GRADY
		Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide.

46	EXT. FRONT PORCH

	A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the 
	door opens, GRADY
	appears.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		Good morning... 
			(eyeing Grady's robe)
		Professor Tripp? Sorry to bother you, sir, but 
		I understand you attended an event at Sara and 
		Walter Gaskell's house last night and were one 
		of the last to leave...

47	INT. LANDING - SAME TIME                                  47

	James lurks at the top of the stairs, swaddled in the 
	sleeping bag, straining to hear.

					OFFICER PUPCIK (O.S.)
		...was just wondering if maybe you saw anyone. 
		Someone you didn't know. Who seemed out of 
		place. Suspicious maybe...

48	EXT. FRONT PORCH 

	GRADY is  scratching his head in mock thought.

					GRADY
		Well, there's always people you don't know at 
		these things, but I can't say there was anybody 
		particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one 
		guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		A jockey? You mean, like--

					GRADY
		Horses, right. Vernon something...
			(thinking... )
		Hardpple

	Pupcik stops on his pad, looks up.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		Hardapple?

					GRADY
		I could be wrong. What happened anyway?

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's 
		closet. And the dog's missing.

					GRADY
		That's weird.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's 
		blind and we figure he just wandered off and 
		got run over.

					GRADY
		The perpetrator.

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		No, the dog.

					GRADY
		Just kidding.

	Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under "Dealing 
	With Assholes."

					OFFICER PUPCIK
		One other thing. About this kid, this student 
		of yours- Leer--James Leer. You wouldn't know 
		how I could get in touch with him, would you?

					GRADY
		I might have his number on campus.

					OFFICER PUPCIK 
		That's all right. We'll find him.

	Pete Pupcik smiles, tips his big blue police hat, and 
	turns away. GRADY frowns, starts to close the door...

					HANNAH GREEN (O.S.) 
		There you are...

	GRADY stiffens, then turns to find Hannah Green across 
	the room in her t-shirt and cowboy boots, looking ail dewy-
	eyed and delectable.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I thought we were going to talk. Last night.

					GRADY
		Oh. Well. I...

	Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up 
	her thighs.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It's okay. ..I'm here when you want me.

	GRADY stands frozen as Hannah smiles sleepily, pushes 
	through the swinging door into the kitchen. A THUMPING is 
	heard as James, tangled in the sleeping bag, hitches down 
	the last few steps of the stairway. He watches Pete Pupcik 
	drive away in his big police car.

					JAMES LEER 
		What do we do now?

#####Before GRADY can reply, .the TELEPHONE sitting on the table next to him 
#####RINGS.

					GRADY
		Hello?

					SARA'S VOICE
		Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You 
		won't believe what's happened.

					GRADY
		Could you hold on a minute, honey?

	With a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever-
	so- gently ...hang up the phone.

					GRADY
		How 'bout we get the hell out of here?

49	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) 

	James, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath 
	his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsack 
	swinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of 
	KEYS.

					GRADY
		You start her up.

	As GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice 
	blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the 
	keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides 
	behind the steering wheel.

					JAMES LEER
			(as the engine roars) 
		How's that?

					GRADY
		Well done, James.

	As GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the 
	wedge SNAPS, splintering into the flesh of Grady's hand.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Shit!

	James blinks, pokes his head out the window.

					JAMES LEER
		You're bleeding. Professor Tripp.

50	INT. AISLE - MARKET - MORNING (LATER)   

	GRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a 
	neighborhood MARKET. GRADY
	has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering 
	his ragged thumb.

					GRADY
		Where exactly do you live, James?

	James, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of 
	ORANGE JUICE, stops.

					GRADY
		Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as 
		to the location of your apartment.

	GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic 
	hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.

					JAMES LEER
		I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked 
		out. I was asked to leave.

					GRADY
		I guess there's probably a story behind that.

					JAMES LEER
		There is, but it's not that interesting.

					GRADY
		So where have you been staying?

					JAMES LEER 
			(a long pause) 
		The bus station.

	GRADY stares incredulously at James.

					JAMES LEER
		It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor. 
		And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.

					GRADY
			(trying to fathom this) 
		But James. I mean. ..How long?

					JAMES LEER
		A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had 
		the gun. For protection.

					GRADY
		Jesus, James, you should've told someone.

					JAMES LEER 
		Who?

					GRADY
		I don't know...
			(unconvincingly)
		Me.

	GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and, 
	abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling 
	on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is 
	staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST 
	PAPERBACK. GRADY
	frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a 
	spray of SHINY MYLAR GIFT BALLOONS.

	A thought evolves.

					GRADY (cont'd)
			(the balloons)
		What do you think of these?

	James takes another chug from his jug, nods.

					JAMES LEER 
		Nice.

51	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - MORNING 

	Grady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared 
	ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in 
	front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off.

52	INT. GALAXIE - CONTINUOUS  

	GRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches 
	something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James 
	glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the 
	glovebox, then peers at the house.

					JAMES LEER 
			(the house) 
		Isn't this...?

					GRADY
		Hm.

	GRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange 
	juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down.

					GRADY
		You better ease off that stuff, James. It's 
		pretty acidic.

	James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat, 
	studies it curiously.

					JAMES LEER
		I can't help myself. I don't know what's the 
		matter with me.

					GRADY
		Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you 
		think's the matter with you?

	As GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers 
	the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets 
	the donut in precisely the same place.

53	INT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER

	Through the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the 
	balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the 
	balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.

					SARA O.S.) 
		Feeling guilty?

	GRADY jumps--startled--and turns. Sara has materialized 
	behind a ficus, large POTTING GLOVES on her hands.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.

					GRADY
		Totally.  I'm sorry. A lot was happening this 
		morning. Can you talk?

	Sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.

					SARA
		Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for 
		WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole 
		Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, 
		too.

					GRADY
		I-heard.

					SARA 
		You heard? How?

					GRADY
		A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house 
		this morning.

					SARA 
		Did you confess?

	GRADY looks up, mildly alarmed.

					SARA
		Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.

					GRADY 
		Really? That was fast.

					SARA 
			(frowning)
		I'm kidding. Hello?

					GRADY
		Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There 
		is something I need to tell...

					SARA
		Are you limping? Why are you limping?

					GRADY
		Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to . 
		. .

					SARA
		Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall 
		somewhere?

					GRADY
		No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I 
		don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell 
		you something.

					SARA 
		All right.

	Sara settles back, folds her arms. Waiting.

					GRADY
		I...

	As GRADY stares into Sara's eyes, things begin to blur. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
		 ...want to be with you.

	Sara looks at him.

					SARA
		Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt.  I 
		don't know whether to swoon or smirk.

					GRADY
		Really, Sara, I...

	Sara holds up one gloved hand.

					SARA
		I believe you. I believe you want to be with 
		me. But this is not just about me anymore.

					GRADY
		I know that. I know what's at stake here...

					SARA
		No, I don't think you do. And besides... I 
		haven't decided yet.

					GRADY
		About the baby.

					SARA 
		That ...and you.

	GRADY goes still, watches Sara strip off the gloves, drop 
	them on  a table.

					SARA
		I'm not going to draw the map for you on this 
		one, Grady. Times like these you have to do 
		your own navigating.

	Sara turns to leave, then stops, squinting far down the 
	street.

					SARA
		Who's that sitting in your car?

					GRADY
		James Leer.

					SARA 
		What's he doing out there?

					GRADY
		I'm sort of helping him work through some 
		issues.

	Sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.

					SARA 
		Isn't he lucky.

	GRADY watches her ripple across the glass, head for the 
	house, and wave. James, slumped low in the Galaxie, offers 
	a limp hand in return, but it's too late.

	She's already gone.

54	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - LATER 54

	GRADY cradles the wheel in his bandaged paw, while James 
	sits stiffly, the orange juice jug bobbing between his 
	thighs.

					JAMES LEER
		She seemed to take it pretty well.

					GRADY
		Yeah, well, actually. . .

	James looks over.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		The moment didn't really present itself.

	James nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window, 
	staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still. GRADY 
	glances at him. At the orange juice jug.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		You' re not planning on puking in my car, are 
		you, James?

	Nothing.

					GRADY
		Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley 
		Heights. We could find you a nice golf course 
		to barf on.

					JAMES LEER 
			(sharply) 
		No.

	GRADY looks over, surprised by the James' tone. James 
	blinks, looks embarrassed.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		I mean. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just...

	James peers out the window at passing landscape.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		I've got a thing about, ..places like this. I 
		know what those houses are like. I know what 
		the people are like.

					GRADY
		Your aunt ?

	James turns, eyes flashing with surprise.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Hannah mentioned something about an aunt.

	James nods vaguely, then reaches into the ashtray, takes 
	a JOINT between his fingers, sniffs it.

					JAMES LEER 
		Humboldt County?

					GRADY
			(surprised)
		Maybe...

					JAMES LEER
		It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.

					GRADY
		Glaucoma?

					JAMES LEER 
		Colon cancer.

					GRADY
		Jesus, James. Wow.

	James puts the joint back in the ashtray.

					JAMES' LEER
		It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a 
		small town.

					GRADY
		Where's that?

					JAMES LEER
		Carvel.

					GRADY
		Carvel? Where's Carvel?

					JAMES LEER 
		Outside Scranton.

					GRADY
		I never heard of it.

					JAMES LEER
		It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin 
		factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five 
		years.

					GRADY
		Your father worked in a mannequin factory?

					JAMES LEER
		Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn. 
		She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before 
		that, she'd been a dancer.

					GRADY
		What kind of dancer? .

					JAMES LEER
		Whatever kind they wanted her to be.

					GRADY 
			(in disbelief)
		James Leer, are you telling me your mother was 
		a stripper?

					JAMES LEER
		I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. 
		And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's 
		clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a 
		bad debt.

					GRADY
		Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic 
		school?

					JAMES LEER 
		When we fall, we fall hard.

					GRADY
		Amazing.

	GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then 
	notices-with surprise--James has his hand out.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		I thought you were the guy who didn't like to 
		lose control of his emotions.

					JAMES LEER
		Maybe I just needed the moment to present 
		itself.

55	EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY .(ONE HOUR LATER)

	GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a 
	modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the 
	JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers.

					JAMES LEER
		This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy 
		would live. What's it called again?

					GRADY
		Kinship.

					JAMES LEER
		Kinship. And what's here?

					GRADY
		Unless I miss my bet...my wife.

	James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise.

					JAMES LEER 
		The one that left you?

					GRADY
		That's right. That one.

56	EXT. FRONT PORCH - WINTERS FAMILY HOUSE

	GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against 
	the glass of the living room window, squints inside. 
	Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the 
	hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's 
	sitting in the indentation.


					JAMES LEER
		Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..-

					GRADY
		How can you tell?

					JAMES LEER
		You can see the outline of a butt.

	As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.

					GRADY
		Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you 
		can start on the box.

58	EXT. BACK PORCH - BACK YARD (MOMENTS LATER)

	As GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows.

					JAMES LEER
		Maybe she didn't come here.

					GRADY
		She came here. We'll just wait. In the 
		meantime, I need you to shimmy through.

	James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch 
	door.

					GRADY
		Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since 
		she was twelve years old. And your hips are as 
		slim as hers.

					JAMES LEER
		It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you 
		know-of what's in the car. In the trunk.

					GRADY
			(a pang of guilt himself)
		Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about 
		that.

	James takes another sad glance at the little door, then 
	drops onto ail fours.

59	INT. LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER     

	GRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it 
	speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so that 
	people will gather together, light a fire, talk.

					JAMES LEER 
		It feels really... good. ..here.

					GRADY
		I know. It's the house you want to wake up in 
		on Christmas morning.
			(moving off)
		Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

60	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 60

	Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a 
	DUFFEL BAG open on the floor, its contents a tangle of 
	quickly-packed clothes. Everything else in the room feels 
	of another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting a 
	PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown.

	One photograph lies face down. GRADY turns it over and 
	finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, 
	standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on their 
	wedding day.

61	INT. DEN     

	James enters, FRENCH ROLL in hand, and sees a REMOTE 
	CONTROL atop the BAR. Taking it, he points it at the WIDE- 
	SCREEN TELEVISION imbedded in the opposite wall and, 
	seconds later, GEORGE SANDERS walks into his CLOSE-UP.

					GEORGE SANDERS
		There's no such thing as a good influence, Mr. 
		Gray. All influence is immoral...

62	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME  

	Grady, a PINK PRINCESS PHONE to his ear, lies on the bed 
	next to a huge TEDDY BEAR.

					GRADY
			(into phone)
		Yes, I' m looking for the Chancellor... I 
		don't know. She should be in the main hall 
		...Thank you.

63	INT. DEN     

	James runs through the channels, pauses on MARTIN MILNER 
	and GEORGE MAHARIS, riding in their curvy Corvette.

64	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - SAME TIME   

	A Nelson Riddle's THEME FROM ROUTE 66 BOOMS from below, 
	GRADY
	cups a hand over his ear.

					GRADY
		Sara? Hi. It's Grady.

					SARA'S VOICE
		Where are you, Grady? An elevator?

					GRADY
		I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some 
		things we need to talk about...

					SARA'S VOICE
			(evenly)
		You're in Kinship?

					GRADY
		Yes. But that's not why I called...

					SARA'S VOICE
		With Emily?

					GRADY
		What? No'. There's no one here. I'm just 
		...just....

					SARA'S VOICE
		Just what? Doing a little dusting?

	As GRADY endeavors to respond, TWO YOUTHFUL VOICES, 
	CHEERFULLY SINGING, rise from below.

					CHEERFUL VOICES       
		Good Morning! Good Morning!

					GRADY
			(yelling)
		James! For Christ sake, will you turn that 
		thing down!

					SARA'S VOICE
		James? He's still with you?

65	INT. DEN 

	James, in the midst of pouring himself a tumbler of 
	Bushmills, smiles as JUDY GARLAND and MICKEY ROONEY sing 
	their hearts out in Babes In Arms.

					JUDY/MICKEY
		We talked the whole night through!

66	INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 

	GRADY shakes his head, carries the phone toward the 
	bedroom WINDOW.

					GRADY
		Look, Sara. ..I'm not here. ..I'm not here to 
		. . .

	As GRADY watches, a late-model PONTIAC BONNEVIlLE turns 
	into the driveway below him.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		 ...reconcile with Emily.

					SARA'S VOICE
		Are you there to not reconcile with her?

	The Bonneville's trunk pops open, revealing THREE BAGS OF 
	GROCERIES, and HANK and IRENE WINTERS, both in their 60's, 
	get out. An enormous NEWFOUNDLAND vaults from the backseat.

	Sara, eating phone static this whole time, interprets 
	Grady's silence her own way.

					SARA'S VOICE (cont'd) 
		Goodbye, Grady.

					GRADY
		No. Sara, you don't understand...

					SARA'S VOICE
		Trust me, I understand. I just want to say 
		something to you, Grady.

					GRADY
			(dreading it) 
		Yea?

					SARA'S VOICE
		How you choose to live your own life is your 
		business. But you be careful with that boy, 
		Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.

	As the line goes dead, GRADY watches Hank and Irene 
	Winters disappear below him.

69	INT. DEN       69

	James--Irish whiskey in one hand, the pride of Humboldt 
	County in the other--watches with deep absorption as Judy 
	and Mickey have a heartfelt conversation. Then, sensing 
	something ...he turns.

	Hank and Irene Winters, grocery bags in arm, stand 
	frozen.

					JAMES LEER     
		Hullo.

	FOOTSTEPS are HEARD on the staircase and GRADY hobbies 
	into view. He tries a smile.

					GRADY
		Mom. Dad.

70	INT. DEN - WINTERS HOUSE - (A BIT LATER) 

	Hank Winters emerges from the bathroom with a roll of 
	tape, a bottle of alcohol, and some cotton wool.

					HANK
		Well, it's infected, I can tell you that. I'm 
		just going to clean it up a bit. It's up to you 
		to-find someone who knows what they're doing. 
		Here. Put your foot up.

	GRADY puts his foot up on Hank's lazy-Boy, then notices a 
	BOOK lying face down on the seat. The AUTHOR on the back 
	cover looks as if he's trying very hard to look 
	consequential. To his surprise, GRADY realizes the author 
	is himself.

					HANK
		So he's one of your students, this boy?

	GRADY glances into the living room, where James and Irene 
	sit on a long couch together, sipping something hot. James 
	is looking out the window, a curious expression on his 
	face. GRADY looks out his own window, sees the Newfoundland 
	sniffing curiously at-the Galaxie's trunk. When he glances 
	back into the living room, he and James make brief eye 
	contact, then blink, look away.

					GRADY
		Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed 
		up.

					HANK
		Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll 
		be fine.

	GRADY tries to read Hank's face---is he messing with 
	him?--but Hank gives nothing away. GRADY nods to the book.

					GRADY
		What made you pull out that old thing?

					HANK
			(shrugging)
		I was thinking of you.

					GRADY
		And?

					HANK
		It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you 
		know that. It's a young man's book. It got me 
		remembering how it felt to be young.

					GRADY
		Maybe I should read it.

					HANK
		Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you 
		aging prematurely, Grady.

	GRADY doesn't have to read Hank's face this time.

					GRADY
		Where's Emily, Hank?

					HANK
		I 'don't know if she'd want me  to tell you 
		that, Grady.

					GRADY
		I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just. 
		..want to know where I stand.

	Hank looks up, incredulous.

					HANK
		Where you stand?

					GRADY
			(embarrassed)
		l-just want to say I'm sorry.

					HANK
		She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The 
		neurologist.

					GRADY
		Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?

					HANK
			(frowning)
		Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley 
		together.

					GRADY
			(sheepishly)
		Oh. Right. Linda ...I haven't been doing a lot 
		of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I 
		have the book to finish and--

					HANK
		Ah, right. The book.

	GRADY starts to continue, then stops, cowed by something 
	in Hank's tone, something dismissive. Instead, he looks 
	away, toward the living room, and catches sight of James 
	again, sitting alone now with his big cup of cocoa.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I 
		didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want 
		you to know that.

					HANK
		Why did you come here, Grady?

	GRADY gestures vaguely.

					GRADY
		I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily. 
		And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let 
		everyone know that, even though it may be 
		difficult to comprehend now, this-everything 
		that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't 
		mean "Goodbye."

					HANK
		Give me a break, Grady.

	Hank snaps off the tape, slaps Grady's ankle.

					HANK
		You're done.

71	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - DUSK   71

	GRADY glowers darkly at the road, then puts his hand up 
	against the HEATING VENT which, apparently, is not putting 
	out any heat.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm having a really good time, Professor 
		Tripp.

	GRADY glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc.

					GRADY
		I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a 
		favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's 
		not for amateurs.

	James looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat 
	LEVER.

					JAMES LEER 
		I just wanted a little sip.

					GRADY
			(squinting at him)
		I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, 
		exactly what point was it that you turned into 
		Serpent Boy?

					JAMES LEER
		Probably about the time you gave me the 
		codeine pills last night.

	GRADY stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose 
	face bears not the slightest trace of irony.

					GRADY
		Jesus... 
			(thinking, then. . . )
		Look, James, you appear to possess-like many 
		an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a 
		rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which 
		dreams are made. However, I 'think it's best 
		if, for the moment at least
			(taking the Ziploc)
			...we abstain.

					JAMES LEER 
		You're mad at me, aren't you?

					GRADY
		What?

					JAMES LEER
		You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's 
		dog.

					GRADY
		It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's--
			(stopping)
		Who said anything about girlfriend?

	James eyes shift slowly, as if to 'say: Who are you 
	kidding?

					GRADY
		Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my 
		girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't 
		exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no 
		reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, 
		the fact remains that I'm the one who took you 
		up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one 
		who has to take the blame. I- don't know what 
		the hell I was thinking.

					JAMES LEER
		Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap 
		gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 
		'I can't let that kid get on. the bus alone-he 
		might never get on the bus again.' You were 
		thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract 
		this kid. ' So you did. It was--in its way--a 
		noble act.

					GRADY
		Thanks for the halo, James, but I've . never 
		done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever.

	James looks -out the window, pondering this.

					JAMES LEER
		So, why did you take me up there?

					GRADY
			(feeling for the heat again)
		I -don' t know, James . I don' t know why I do 
		half the things I do. Who does?
			(looking over)
		Why do you wear that coat?

	James looks down, a little defensive.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's warm.

					GRADY
		James, fall semester, first day of class, it 
		was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.

	James just blinks, no ready answer-available.

					GRADY
		That's why they all give you such a hard time 
		in workshop.

					JAMES LEER 
		Because of my coat?

					GRADY
		Because you act like a goddamn spook all the 
		time. Not to mention the fact that every last 
		one of them is jealous of you.

					JAMES LEER 
			(smirking) 
		Jealous? Of me?

					GRADY
		Not you. Your talent.

	James' face hardens. He looks away.

					JAMES LEER 
		You're lying.

					GRADY
		The hell I am.

					JAMES LEER
		Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You 
		said so yourself.

					GRADY
		I never said that.

					JAMES LEER
		Yes you did. Last night. To your friend 
		Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you 
		said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.

					GRADY
		I didn't mean it that way.

					JAMES LEER
		It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, 
		the others--they 're right. My stories are 
		annoying. They go on and on and on, and the 
		longer they go on the more annoying they 
		become, until finally you just want to grab 
		something heavy and--

					GRADY
		Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and 
		Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking 
		about, okay? The entire class combined-
		including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one 
		tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

	James stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the 
	window. He ponders Grady's words, the praise inherent in 
	them. A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.

					JAMES LEER 
		But, last night...

					GRADY
		Who cares what-. I said last night, James I I 
		was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a 
		dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me 
		some slack?

					JAMES LEER 
			(quietly) 
		I'm sorry.

					GRADY
		And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares 
		what anybody thinks anyway? You want to .be a 
		good writer? You want to be-a great writer? 
		Then stop giving a damn what other people 
		think. Most of them haven't thought in .years.

	James turns, studies Grady's face as it flickers in the 
	first headlights of the evening.

					GRADY
		Let me spell it .out for you, James. Books 
		don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not 
		anymore.

					JAMES LEER
		Arsonist's Daughter meant something.

	GRADY smiles contemptuously.

					JAMES LEER
		I mean it. It means something to me. It's one 
		of the reasons I came to school here. To be in 
		your class. To be taught by you.
			(quietly)
		It's one of the reasons I wanted to become a 
		writer.

	GRADY stares ahead, watching the darkness tumble away 
	before the wide sweep of the Galaxie's headlights.

					GRADY
		Well, for that, if nothing else, James, I'm 
		sorry.

72	EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL - OFF THE HIGHWAY - EVENING 

	GRADY rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James 
	slides out. GRADY
	stays put, hands still on the wheel.

					JAMES LEER
		You coming?

					GRADY
		In a minute. Get us a table.

	James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee 
	shop, and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a 
	table with a view of the highway. GRADY
	watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into 
	the booth and open his big, laminated menu.

	Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY 
	kicks open his door, steps out.

73INT/	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER  

	GRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he 
	speaks.

					GRADY
		C-a-r-v-e-I. That's right, Carvel. Yes, I'm 
		sure. It's outside Scranton.

	GRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by 
	himself on the far side of the coffee shop.

					GRADY
		You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at 
		this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a 
		resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd 
		be pretty interested to learn that the good 
		people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his 
		entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this 
		up as I go along--

	GRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Never mind. My mistake.

74	EXT. GALAXIE - PARKING LOT     74

	GRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An 
	AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of 
	CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows 
	peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch.

	He takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice: 
	James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS it 
	says only: "On File." But if one was to dial the PHONE 
	NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the 
	Greyhound depot who picks up.

75	INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT (LATER)

	The remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as 
	he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE 
	PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars 
	that whip by on the highway beyond the window.

					JAMES LEER 
		Want a bite?

					GRADY
		No thanks.

					JAMES LEER
		That's why you're having them. Your spells.

					GRADY
		Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like 
		we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't 
		have spells.

					JAMES LEER 
		What would you call them then?

					GRADY
		I don't know. ...'Episodes.'

	James shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.

					JAMES LEER
		It's because you don't eat.

					GRADY
		I eat.

					JAMES LEER
		When?

					GRADY
		When nobody's looking.

	GRADY watches a pair of headlights approach...

					JAMES LEER
			(mouth full, garbled)
		I just worry about you, that's all.

	...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks 
	at him.

					GRADY
		You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?

					JAMES LEER
		Okay.

	Just then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against 
	the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking 
	lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
		Where you going?

					GRADY
		Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.

	GRADY moves off, then stops, looking back at James and 
	his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words.

76	EXT. COFFEE SHOP/MOTEL   

	As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER 
	MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming 
	BLACK MERCEDES. Beyond him, in the front passenger seat, a 
	WOMAN in MINK examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror of 
	the sun visor.

					MAN
			(eyeing GRADY dubiously) 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Grady.

					MAN
		Fred Leer. This is my wife Amanda.

					GRADY
			(re: their clothes)
		Looks like I've dashed a-wonderful evening.

					FRED LEER
		Hardly.

					AMANDA LEER
		We were on our way to a benefit. But, as luck 
		would have it, the club was on the way, so... 
			(snapping shut the visor)
		We were able to put in an appearance.

					FRED LEER
		Otherwise we would've been here earlier.

					GRADY
		Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a 
		little dinner.

					FRED LEER
		Well, certainly we'll reimburse you.

					GRADY
		That's not necessary. I just felt. ..it might 
		be good for James to be with his family this 
		weekend.

					FRED LEER
		Well, of course, we can understand that.

	GRADY considers the two glittering ghosts before him. 
	They seem to be waiting. Just waiting.

					GRADY
		Well. Let me go get him.

	GRADY turns for the coffee shop, then stops, looks back.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		I "hope you won't consider this forward of me, 
		Amanda, but I wonder if I might ask. ..did you 
		ever attend Catholic school?

	Amanda Leer's eyes narrow ever-so-slightly.

					AMANDA LEER 
		Excuse me?

77	INT. BOOTH - COFFEE SHOP77 

	James is glowering at the parking lot as GRADY returns.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not going with them..

					GRADY
		James. Listen. Things-things are a little 
		weird with me right now and I-- well--I have 
		enough blame to shoulder these days without 
		having to take the blame if something bad 
		happened to you. And if you hang around me long 
		enough, something bad is going to happen, trust 
		me. That's why I need you to go home. 
		Understand?

					JAMES LEER 
		I'm not going, with them.

					GRADY
		James, like it or not, they're your parents.

					JAMES LEER
		Parents? They're not my parents. They're my 
		grandparents. My parents are dead.

	GRADY stares at-James wearily.

					JAMES LEER
		I swear. My father had his own airplane he 
		used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and 
		my mom were flying up to our house in the 
		Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in 
		the newspaper.

	GRADY doesn't flinch, unpersuaded.

					JAMES LEER
		I 'swear. My father was a senior vice 
		president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite. 
		Her maiden name was Guggenheim.

	GRADY starts to protest, then pauses.

					GRADY
		I remember that. Five or six years ago.

					JAMES LEER
		Six. Their plane went down right outside 
		Scranton.

					GRADY 
			(sardonically) 
		Near Carvel?

					JAMES LEER
		I'm sorry about all that. I just-I don't like 
		to talk about my family. They treat me like a 
		freak. 
			(nodding towards Amanda)

	She makes me sleep in. the basement of my own house. It's 
	mine. My parents left it to me.

	GRADY glances toward the parking lot, studies the  
	contours of Fred Leer's face. Frowns.

					GRADY
		James, come on. That man is obviously your 
		father. You look just like him.

	James looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and 
	speaks in a voice heavy with implication.

					JAMES LEER
		There's a reason for that.

	Grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little 
	riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting.

					GRADY
		Get out of here.

					JAMES LEER
		That's why she hates me. That's why she makes 
		me sleep in the basement.

					GRADY
		In the crawl space, with the rats and the 
		casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.

	As GRADY lifts him from the booth, James attempts a 
	plaintive tone, but his heart's not in it.

					JAMES LEER 
		I swear.

78	EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER       78

	As Fred Leer SLAMS the back door of the Mercedes, GRADY 
	waves vaguely, peers into the darkness of the back seat.

					FRED LEER 
		Thank you. Professor Tripp.

					GRADY
		Take care of him.

					AMANDA LEER
		Oh, don't worry. We'll take care of him. You 
		can be sure of that.

	Fred Leer hits the gas and swings the Mercedes around in 
	a tight little arc, feathering Grady's pants--from the knee 
	down--with a pudding of ICE and MUD. GRADY glances down at 
	his spattered self, then notices, sitting on the front 
	passenger seat, James' knapsack. GRADY grabs it, turns.

					GRADY
		Hey!

	GRADY'S POV - REAR WINDOW
	as the Mercedes begins to pull away and James turns, 
	elbows on the back dash, his pale face slack. Spying Grady, 
	he raises one limp hand, and then-as if it were held by a 
	string-lets it drop.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(softly) 
		Hey.

79	EXT. PARKING LOT - MQTEL/COFFEE SHOP - A. BIT LATER   

	GRADY sits in-the GREEN GLOW of .the radio dial, smoking 
	a joint. He glances at the knapsack, sees James' 
	MANUSCRIPT:

	The Love Parade

	He reaches in, takes the manuscript and, in the light 
	that rains from the PARKING LAMP overhead, begins to read.

80	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)      80

	Grady's HOUSE looks like a three-dollar whore on a block 
	full of nuns. MUSIC BLARES, LIGHT BLAZES from every window, 
	and there are so many CARS GRADY is forced to leave the 
	Galaxie in the middle of the street.


					GRADY
			(knowingly) 
		Crabtree.

81	INT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER  

	Times Square before the ball drops. GRADY enters, scans 
	the room, then shoulders his way to the stairs.

82	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE  

	Hannah Green sits on the sofa, twisting a long strand of 
	hair around her finger as she reads a THICK MANUSCRIPT.

					GRADY
			(entering) 
		Hey.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Grady!

	She slaps the page she is reading back onto the stack at 
	her thigh. GRADY
	stares. The manuscript. It's his.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(embarrassed)
		I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, 
		just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist 
		and-and--I suck.

					GRADY
		No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it 
		out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn't been 
		in here, has he? Poking around?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I don't know--maybe- I don't think so.

	Grady's  mind races with unfortunate possibilities, but 
	only briefly: his immediate thoughts are elsewhere.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that 
		aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.

					HANNAH GREEN
		He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The 
		blind one.

					GRADY
		Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What?

					HANNAH GREEN
		At first the police thought he just ran away, 
		but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood 
		spots on the carpet -

					GRADY
		Jesus.

					HANNAH GREEN
		CRABTREE said it sounded like something James 
		would be messed up in.

					GRADY
		Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Who does?

	Just then, Crabtree's VOICE bellows in the hallway 
	outside.

					CRABTREE (O.S.) 
		Trip?! Where are you'

	GRADY looks anxiously toward the door.

					GRADY
		The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James 
		that day?

					HANNAH GREEN
		I told you, Sewickly Heights.      

					GRADY
		But where? I need the street.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a 
		corner. 

					CRABTREE (O.S.)
		Trip?!

					GRADY
		Shit.

	As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah hooks her finger 
	inside his belt buckle.

					HANNAH GREEN
		No! Don't go. I've been waiting ail night for 
		you.

	GRADY looks at Hannah's hand, where it rests. He looks 
	terrified.

					GRADY
		Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but 
		right now I--

					CRABTREE
			(bursting in)
		Tripp, where the hell. . .

	CRABTREE stops, takes in the tableau before him.

					CRABTREE (cont'd)
		Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting a. student-
		teacher conference?

	GRADY delicately removes Hannah's hand from his buckle, 
	points at Crabtree.

					GRADY
		You stay there.

					CRABTREE
		What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?

	CRABTREE cocks his head toward the reams of paper stacked 
	on Grady's desk.

					CRABTREE
		Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would 
		sneak in here and read your book without asking 
		you?

					GRADY
		Gee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to 
		remember you actually asking me if you could 
		invite 200 people over to trash my living room.

					CRABTREE
		Sometimes we have to improvise.

					GRADY
			(ignoring him)
		Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I 
		mean, besides you and. ..me?

					CRABTREE
		James? My James? What's happened?

					GRADY
		Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't 
		know.. .kidnapped.

					CRABTREE
		Kidnapped? By who?

					GRADY
		His parents.

					CRABTREE
		Good God. Let's go rescue him.

					GRADY
		Good idea. Crabs. Only one problem. I don't 
		know where they live.

					CRABTREE
		Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know 
		where he lives.

					GRADY
		It's a little late to call Admissions.

					CRABTREE
		Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?

					GRADY
		Maybe ...I don't know.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Two-sixty-two Baxter Drive.

	GRADY and CRABTREE turn, see Hannah sitting on the corner 
	of Grady's desk with the WHITE PAGES open on her lap.

					HANNAH GREEN (cont'd)
		They're in the book.

83	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING - TEN MINUTES LATER

	CRABTREE snaps James' manuscript closed.

					CRABTREE
		You know--based on what I've read-- this is a 
		very exciting piece of material, this Big 
		Parade.

					GRADY
		Love. It's Love facade--and what do you mean 
		'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two 
		chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling 
		methamphetamines.

					CRABTREE
		I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I 
		feel this kid in my bones.

					GRADY
		Only in your bones?

	GRADY smirks, glances at Crabtree, but gets a surprise; 
	CRABTREE offers no snappy come-back, no antic wordplay. He 
	just stares out the window, his voice distant.

					CRABTREE
		No. I think I might be right. I've felt it 
		before...

	As Crabtree's voice trails off, GRADY studies him.

					GRADY
		How bad is it for you?

					CRABTREE
		Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit 
		the new corporate profile.

					GRADY
		Which is?

					CRABTREE
		Competence.

	GRADY and CRABTREE look at each other a moment, then 
	CRABTREE smiles, gives a little shrug, and picks up James' 
	knapsack, rummaging through the contents.

					CRABTREE (cont'd) 
		So tell me about you and the Chancellor.

					GRADY
		What's to tell?

					CRABTREE
		Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...

	CRABTREE fishes out the biography of Erroll Flynn, gives 
	it a look.

					CRABTREE
		...I like her.

	GRADY peers at the stars, his voice barely audible.

					GRADY
		Me too.

84	EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SEWICKLEY HEIGHTS     84-

	The battered Galaxie floats up a narrow road, gliding 
	through a canyon of mansion walls and the occasional 
	winding drive. Up ahead a stone post marker with the 
	numerals "262." GRADY kills the headlights.

					GRADY
		This is it.

84A	EXT. LEER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Grady--limping like an aging prizefighter--leads CRABTREE 
	up a steep incline toward an enormous three-story house. 
	The Leer's Mercedes gleams in the shadows.

					CRABTREE
		Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on . 
		that thing. How are we-supposed to find his?

					GRADY
		I told you. They keep him chained in the 
		basement. Come on.

85	EXT. REAR - LEER HOUSE

	LIGHT GLOWS from a low BASEMENT WINDOW. From one side, a 
	WOMAN is HEARD SINGING. GRADY and CRABTREE pause, listen.

					WOMAN SINGING 
		Why should I care though he gave me the air? 
		Why should I cry, heave a sigh, and wonder why? 
		And wonder why?

					CRABTREE
		Doris Day.

	CRABTREE and GRADY look at each other.

					GRADY/CRABTREE
		James Leer.

	GRADY moves to the window and RAPS on the glass. A moment 
	later, James peeks out. Seeing Grady, his face brightens 
	briefly, unguarded, then quickly resumes its usual Leerian 
	aspect. He motions with his hand, as if to say, "That way."

86	EXT. BASEMENT DOOR    

	The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in 
	a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the 
	seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves.

					JAMES LEER
		Hey. What are you guys doing here?

					CRABTREE
		We're springing you. Leer. Get some pants on.

	As they step inside, GRADY gives James' PJs the once-
	over.

					GRADY
		I can't believe you made fun of my robe.

87	INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT    87

	Electric CANDELABRAS light a large converted cellar whose 
	walls are crowded with MOVIE POSTERS and LOBBY CARDS. There 
	are STACKS of what look suspiciously like LIBRARY BOOKS and 
	an enormous BAROQUE BED, complete with CANOPY.

					CRABTREE
		I like what you've done with it. When's 
		Captain Nemo moving in?

					JAMES LEER 
		The candelabras were my Gran's.

					GRADY
		Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll 
		leave you here.

					CRABTREE
		Hey, I heard all about it--the parents, the 
		grandparents, the China town thing-- and I 
		believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now 
		go get dressed.

	James scoops up the shirt GRADY lent him. this morning.

					JAMES LEER
		Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this 
		again. Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		Ah, wear whatever you want.

	James flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom.

					CRABTREE
		So modest.

					GRADY
		So sensitive.

					CRABTREE
			(nosing around the room)
		Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.

					GRADY
		It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just 
		once I'd like to know if the little bastard is 
		telling the truth.

					CRABTREE
		The-truth. I know that's always been real 
		important to you. Key, check this out...

	CRABTREE leans over an old ROYAL TYPEWRITER, reads from 
	the freshly-typed PAGE curling from the carriage.

					CRABTREE
		Finally, the door opened. It-was a shock to: 
		see him, shuffling into the room like an aging 
		prizefighter. Limping. Beaten.'
			(with an amused smile) 
		Sound like anyone we know?
			(resuming) 
		But it was later, when the great man squinted 
		into the bitter glow or twilight...
			(frowning)
		Bitter glow of twilight? This kid definitely 
		needs an editor.
			(resuming)
	...and muttered simply, "It means nothing. All of it. 
	Nothing," that the true shock came. It was then that the 
	boy understood that his hero's true injuries lay hidden in 
	a darker place. His heart...'

	CRABTREE stops abruptly.

					GRADY
		Yes? 'His heart...'

	CRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on:

					CRABTREE
		'His heart, once capable of inspiring others 
		so completely, could no longer inspire so much 
		as itself. It beat now only out of habit. It 
		beat now only because it could. '

	GRADY nods, his face unreadable, then James returns.

					JAMES LEER 
		I'm ready...

	James stops, sees the two men looking at him.

					JAMES LEER 
		You all right, Professor Tripp?

					CRABTREE
		He's great. Come on, let's blow before ol' 
		Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.

					JAMES LEER
		Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming 
		down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, 
		check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call 
		the police or.. .something.

					CRABTREE
		Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows 
		and one of your teddy bears under the spread 
		and she won't know the difference.

					JAMES LEER 
			(brightening)
		Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use 
		a couple big hams.

					GRADY
		No.

	CRABTREE and James turn.

					GRADY
		I've got something better than a teddy bear.

	CUT TO: POE -- as he's lowered delicately onto James' 
	bed. 

88	INT. JAMES' ROOM - BASEMENT (A FEW MINUTES LATER) 

	GRADY strategically arranges the coverlet, gently 
	adjusting Poe's head so only a TUFT of FUR shows. He steps 
	back, joining CRABTREE and James for an assessment.

					GRADY
		Sweet dreams, Jimmy.

89	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - LATER 

	The lights are still blazing, the front door is wide 
	open, but not a soul remains.

90	INT. LIVING ROOM

	A quiet disaster, the only sound an LP playing meekly on 
	the STEREO. James passes through first, ignoring the 
	TORTILLA CHIPS POPPING under his shoes, then CRABTREE and 
	GRADY appear.

					CRABTREE
		Things must've picked up after we left.

	CRABTREE pats Grady's cheek, heads upstairs. 

91	INT. HALLWAY

	Crabtree's door is closing as GRADY hobbles into view.

					GRADY
		Crabtree.

					CRABTREE
			(sticking his head out) 
		Ye-es?

	GRADY looks down, sees James Leer's black brogues sitting 
	on the floor outside Crabtree's door.

					GRADY
		Nothing.

	The door closes, the LATCH CLICKS, and GRADY is left 
	alone, the bossa nova floating softly in the air.

92	INT. HANNAH'S ROOM 

	Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets, surrounded by 
	little colonies of Grady's manuscript. GRADY studies her, 
	then detects something on the floor. The red boots.

	Delicately, he lifts the sheet. Hannah Green's feet-- 
	finally revealed in ail their naked glory--prove to be 
	thick, wide, and ordinary. GRADY
	sighs.

93	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE 

	The TV is on. GRADY steps to the doorway, pauses.

					VOICE 
		Hey.

	A HEAD cranes over the sofa. It's the Goatee Kid from 
	Thaw Hail.

					GRADY
		How are you--is it Joe?

					GOATEE KID
		Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your 
		house until about an hour ago.

					GRADY
		Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.

					GOATEE KID
		Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, 
		what I said that time in office hours-I hope 
		there's no hard feelings.

					GRADY
		No...

					GOATEE KID
		I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at 
		the time and my car was ail fucked up and--
		well--I was pretty bent in general.

					GRADY
		It's cool, Jeff. Really.

					GOATEE KID
		I just want you to know that's why I dropped 
		your class and said all that shit about the 
		university stealing my money and you being a 
		pseudo-Faulknerian nobody.

94	EXT. PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE - NIGHT (A BIT LATER)

	GRADY sits quietly on the porch steps, a joint burning in 
	his fingers. To his left, perched atop a Haagen-Dazs 
	container, is a TELEPHONE. As he pulls it into his lap, a 
	LAMP in the living room pirouettes clumsily, spins free of 
	the cord, and SHATTERS on the floor.

	GRADY blinks, looks away, and DIALS, just as. ..the 
	CLATTERING COUGH of an ENGINE is HEARD and a VAN appears. 
	Stenciled on its side panel is:

	Kravnik's Sporting Goods

	The van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past 
	Grady's house and disappears around the corner. GRADY 
	frowns, then realizes a MAN'S VOICE is coming from the 
	RECEIVER in his lap.

					MAN (O.S. ) 
		Hello? Hello...?

	The VOICE is groggy. It is Walter Gaskell's voice.

					GRADY
		Walter?

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Yes?

	GRADY says nothing, as if wondering what he's doing.

					WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd) 
		Who's this ?

					GRADY
		It's Grady, Walter.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Grady?

					GRADY
		GRADY Tripp. English Department.

					WALTER'S VOICE
		I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, 
		Grady, do you know what time it -is?

					GRADY
			(looking at his watch)
		I have ...eight-fifteen. That's not right, is 
		it?

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		It's three-thirty, Grady.

					GRADY
		This is important.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Oh? 

					GRADY
		I... I...

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		What is it, Grady?

					GRADY
		I'm in love with your wife.

					WALTER'S VOICE 
		Excuse me?

					GRADY
		Sara. I'm in love with her.

	Silence. Then Walter's VOICE returns: even, 
	administrative.

					WALTER'S VOICE
		Are you drinking. Professor Tripp? Right now.

	GRADY sips on his roach, responds in a pinched voice.

					GRADY
		No. 

					WALTER'S VOICE
		Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office 
		Monday morning.

	As the line goes dead, GRADY stares at the phone, 
	wondering if he has, in fact, just done what he thinks he's 
	just done.

95	EXT. GRADY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNDAY MORNING (NEXT DAY)

	A CAR rattles down the street, NEWSPAPERS pinwheeling 
	from-the window.

96	INT. GRADY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

	A heavy THHNK hits the driveway outside and GRADY blinks. 
	Sitting in his pink robe, bleary-eyed, he reconsiders the 
	piece of paper curling from his typewriter.

	GRADY'S POV - of THE PAGE

	It's obvious he's been sitting like this for some time. 
	Just then, the DISTINCTIVE PURR of an ENGINE is HEARD. 
	GRADY peers through the window, watches a CAB. glide to the 
	curb below. A Citroen DS23. Sara.

97	EXT. FRONT PORCH - GRADY'S HOUSE

	GRADY steps onto the porch, unintentionally punting a 
	BOTTLE of Iron City Beer onto the front lawn..

					GRADY
		Sara.

					SARA
		I tried to call, but apparently there's 
		something wrong...

	Sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		...with your phone. Unfortunately, mine was 
		ringing loud and clear this morning.

	GRADY doesn't know what this means, but he's pretty sure 
	it's not good.

					GRADY
		Oh?

					SARA
		It seems one of our students is - missing and 
		his parents found a dead dog in his bed.

					GRADY
			(slumping to the porch)
		I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. 
		It's all my-

	Sara raises her hand, silencing him.

					SARA
		I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. 
		But more importantly, Walter's not very happy 
		and he's gotten the police involved. They seem 
		to think James Leer is somehow responsible for 
		all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where 
		James is, would you, Grady?

					GRADY
		Inside.

					SARA 
		And the jacket?

					GRADY
		Over there. In the backseat of the...

	Grady's hand hangs in mid-air, gesturing pointlessly to 
	the driveway, where the only thing that exists is an oil 
	stain roughly the shape of North Dakota.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		Someone stole my car.

					SARA
		Grady.

					GRADY
		Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it 
		right there last night.

					SARA
		Are you sure you parked it there?

					GRADY
		Of course, I'm sure.  Ah, Christ, the puberty 
		police are back.

	Sara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb.

					SARA
		I'll deal with this. You dig up James.

98	INT. CRABTREE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	CRABTREE sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The 
	Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is the 
	. sole visible part of .James Leer.

					GRADY
			(swinging in)
		Is he awake?

					CRABTREE
		I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.

					GRADY
		Nevertheless. There's a police officer 
		standing on the porch and I don't think he's 
		going away.

					JAMES LEER
			(from under the covers) 
		That same guy?

	CRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one 
	eye.

					JAMES LEER 
		You snore.

					CRABTREE
		So I hear.

					JAMES LEER 
			(studying Grady)
		No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look 
		sorta crappy.

					CRABTREE
		He's right, you look horrible.

					GRADY
		Thank you, Frankie and Annette.

	James swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks 
	bare assed across the room to retrieve his BVDs.

					JAMES LEER 
		It's the Chancellor.

					CRABTREE
		Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.

					GRADY
		And we both thank you for that, but we're... 
		we're... fine.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.

	GRADY squints at James as he pulls on his pants.

					GRADY
		Shut up, James.

					CRABTREE
		So what's the problem?

					GRADY
			(a tad tense)
		There is no problem. Did I say there was a 
		problem?

	As James' head pops through Grady's fully-buttoned 
	flannel, he and CRABTREE
	exchange a knowing glance, at once referring to and 
	excluding Grady.

					SARA (0. S.)
		How's it coming back there, Professor Tripp?

					CRABTREE
		Who's that?

					GRADY
		Who do you think it is?

					CRABTREE
		The Chancellor's here? Now?

					GRADY
		Evidently. 
			(calling)
		Coming!     

					JAMES LEER
		Does she mean--does she know about ...her dog?

					GRADY
		It's Walter's dog and yes, she does. Know. But 
		let's spare her the details. Come on, your 
		shoes are in the hail.

					CRABTREE
		James. This book of yours. It's not bad. Not 
		bad at all.

	James stops, considers this piece of news with a look of 
	deep seriousness, then nods.

					JAMES LEER 
		Thank you.

					CRABTREE
		You're welcome.

	As James shuffles off into the hail, CRABTREE looks at 
	Grady, his eyes dancing with excitement.


					CRABTREE
		I want to publish this.  I've got to.  I think 
		they'll let me.  With a little editorial 
		guidance it could be brilliant. 

					GRADY
		Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out 
		there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been 
		awhile since somebody wrote a good book in 
		jail.

99	EXT. GRADY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Sara and GRADY stand by as Pete Pupcik deposits James in 
	the back of the squad car, SLAMS the door.

	PUPCIK
	As I told the Chancellor, Professor, I'm. just going to 
	run James here over to the university. It'll be up to Dr. 
	Gaskell where we go from there.

	GRADY nods, leans in the window to James.

					GRADY
		Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.

					JAMES LEER
		I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. 
		Professor Tripp?

					GRADY
		I'm a little worried, James.

					JAMES LEER 
		Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I 
		probably should be expelled.

					GRADY
		Well, let's see if we can keep that from 
		happening.

	James nods and GRADY starts to step back from the car.

					JAMES LEER
		Professor Tripp...?

					GRADY
		Yes, James.

					JAMES LEER
		Even if I end up going to jail....

	James smiles his crooked grin.

					JAMES LEER (cont'd)
		You're still the best teacher I ever had.

	On this,  Pete Pupcik pulls away, leaving GRADY standing 
	on the curb, watching the back of James' head, framed in 
	the rear  window of the police car, growing smaller.

					SARA
		This is not what the university has in mind 
		when it promises a liberal education, Grady.

					GRADY
		Would Walter really press charges?

					SARA
		It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs 
		pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit 
		prickly this morning.

	Grady, detecting something in Sara's tone, turns, watches 
	her take a drag on her cigarette.

					SARA (cont'd) 
		You didn't happen to call the house last 
		night, did you, Grady?

					GRADY
		I think I might have.

					SARA
		And what do you think you might have said?

					GRADY
		I think I might've said I was in love with 
		you.

	Sara's face remains .unchanged.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
		He told you.

					SARA 
		He told me.

					GRADY
		And what did you say?

					SARA
		I said it didn't sound like you. 

	Sara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her 
	car, and dives away.  GRADY looks after her sadly, then 
	turns, sees CRABTREE standing on the porch wearing a shirt 
	which claims "Ativan Chases the Clouds Away."

					CRABTREE
		So- what do we do now? ,

					GRADY
		Find the jacket.

					CRABTREE
		Oh' huh. Exactly how do we do that?

					GRADY
		First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her 
		car.

					CRABTREE
		It seems to me that girl would let you borrow 
		her pancreas.

100	INT. HANNAH'S ROOM   - 100

	Hannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets, SMILES as she 
	listens to the Goatee Kid, who sits cross-legged at the 
	foot of-her bed, fully clothed.

					GOATEE KID
		I'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent 
		homosexual love. Look at the way they dance--
		it's sodomy.

					HANNAH GREEN
			(laughing) 
		Stop it.

	Hannah looks up, sees GRADY in the doorway and blushes. 
	She pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Grady. Hi. What's up?

	Jeff eases off the bed, past GRADY uneasily.

					GOATEE KID
		I'll be ...somewhere else.

					GRADY
		Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in 
		discussing that business with the tango, try 
		the guy at the end of the hall.

	Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes. GRADY smirks.

					GRADY
		He cribbed that from Borges.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It beats 'What's your major?'

	GRADY nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice.

					GRADY
		Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could 
		borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of 
		commission.

					HANNAH GREEN
		Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to. 
		..to your book.

	The hitch in Hannah's voice hangs in the room like a 
	cloud.

					HANNAH GREEN
		I uh, I didn't finish, I ...fell asleep.

					GRADY
		That good, hub?

					HANNAH GREEN
		No, it's not that, it's...

	Hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her 
	dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to Grady.

					HANNAH GREEN
		It's just that, you know, I was thinking about 
		how, in class, you're always telling us '-that 
		writers make choices--at least the good ones. 
		And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the 
		book isn't really great-I mean, really great-
		but at times it's, well, very detailed, you 
		know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses 
		and ail the dental records and so on-and I 
		don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of 
		reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... 
			(with trepidation)
	...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was 
	wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you 
	wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence.

					GRADY
			(stung)
		Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as 
		shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first 
		writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, 
		it might interest you to know that one book I 
		wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, ' 
		happened to win a little something called the 
		PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under 
		the influence. '

	Hannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately GRADY feels 
	ridiculous. He starts to say something, but instead gathers 
	his manuscript and exits.

101	INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER   

	Crabtree, dressed now, studies the freight 'in Grady's 
	arms as he reaches the bottom of the stairs.

					CRABTREE
		Want some help with that?

					GRADY
			(passing by)
		Don't touch it.

102	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT - MOVING  

	CRABTREE sucks on a Kool, driving Hannah's rattling 
	Renault too fast, shifting gears apparently at random. 
	GRADY rides shotgun, still wearing the robe over his 
	clothes, the Wonder Boys manuscript sitting like a 
	watermelon on his lap-looking, all in all, fairly pathetic.

					CRABTREE
		Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes 
		you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his 
		car.

					GRADY
		Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't 
		exactly Jerry's to give.

					CRABTREE
		So whose car is it?

					GRADY
		My guess-Vernon Hardapple.

					CRABTREE
		The hood jumper?

					GRADY
		He said a few things that lead me to believe 
		the car's his.

					CRABTREE
		Such as.

					GRADY
		'That's my car, motherfucker.'

					CRABTREE
		Hh hub. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. 
		We find the car...

					GRADY
		...we find the jacket.

					CRABTREE
		There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know 
		his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we 
		made the whole guy up.

					GRADY
		No wonder he screwed us over.

	CUT TO:

	BILL MAZEROSKI legendary Pittsburgh Pirate second 
	baseman, large as a Macy's Day float, his weathered image 
	scaling three floors on the BRICK face of a RIVERFRONT 
	STOREFRONT.

103	INT. HANNAH'S CAR

	CRABTREE takes a corner recklessly, immediately slows, 
	and blinks in amazement.

					CRABTREE
		Christ, Tripp. How did you know?

					GRADY
		Call it a hunch.

	Parked in front of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS is the white 
	van. A few feet behind, the battered Galaxie.

					CRABTREE
		I'd call it genius.

	GRADY steps out, strips off the robe, and drops the lumpy 
	leviathan that is his manuscript on the front seat.

					GRADY
		It's good to know I'm still talented at 
		something. Keep the motor running.

104	EXT./	INT. GALAXIE    104

	GRADY peers into the backseat, squinting against the WIND 
	that swirls around him. Errol Flynn's face leers back at 
	him. But no jacket. GRADY slides in, pops the glove box, 
	and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County. He pockets it 
	anyway, then spies something else.

	James Leer's little PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL.

	GRADY takes it, rotates it-in his palm. SUNLIGHT GLINTS 
	off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a 
	SWEET, SOFT BLUR...

105	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT 

	CRABTREE stomps on his Kool. GRADY looks very much like a 
	man who has pulled off the road to take a nap.

					CRABTREE
		What the hell...

106	INT. GALAXIE

	As GRADY lolls behind the steering wheel, a CLOUD 
	appears, hovering, then slowly mutates, and GRADY realizes 
	it's not a cloud at all, it's

	MARILYN MONROE standing by the side mirror, wearing a 
	bright pink dress under her wedding jacket.

					MARILYN 
		I know you. . .

	Marilyn's face swims before Grady's eyes, but there's 
	something wrong with it. This girl's eyes are brown and 
	besides, she's ...fat.

					MARILYN (cont'd) 
		Double Dickel on the rocks.

	The last of the fairy dust evaporates and GRADY finds- 
	standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn 
	Monroe's wedding jacket--0ola, the pregnant waitress from 
	the Hi-Hat Club.

					GRADY
		Oola.

					OOLA 
		I never forget a drink.

					GRADY
		I never forget an Oola.

	Suddenly, there is a HEAVY CLICK.

					MAN'S VOICE (0.S.) 
		Forget me?

	GRADY starts to turn, but his head won't  move: largely 
	because the BARREL of a GERMAN NINE is pressed to his 
	temple. Grady's eyes slide.

					GRADY
		Vernon.

					VERNON
			(to Oola)
		Move away, cupcake.  He's got a gun.

					GRADY
		Who's got a gun?

					VERNON 
		You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!

					GRADY
		Relax, Vernon...

					OOLA 
		Why's he calling you Vernon?

					VERNON
		Why's he sitting in my car? He's crazy, that's 
		why. He probably calls everybody Vernon.

					GRADY
		Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. 
		Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon 
		Peabody at Penguin U.K.

					VERNON 
		Shut up. 
			(to Oola)
		Cupcake. Please. Inside.

					OOLA 
		You' re not going to shoot him, are you?

					VERNON
		I'm going to shoot him. If he doesn't put that 
		gun down.

					GRADY
		It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the 
		caps anymore.

					VERNON
		Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And 
		that's a gun.

					GRADY
		No, really....

	GRADY lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled 
	pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead.

107	INT. HANNAH'S RENAULT

	CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's 
	arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind.

					CRABTREE
		Holy shit.

108	EXT. KRAVNIKS 

	Vernon stands half-hunched, stunned.

					VERNON 
		Are you crazy!

	The gunshot seems to have cleared Grady's head. He stares 
	at the gun, watches Vernon wrest it from his hand.

					VERNON (cont'd)
		Get out! What's the matter with you? Can't you 
		see the condition my girl's in?

	As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on 
	Oola's tummy.

					VERNON 
		You all right, cupcake?

					OOLA 
		Who's Vernon?

	A rude SQUEAL breaks the silence--rubber scratching 
	asphalt--and Grady, Oola, and Vernon turn to see Hannah 
	Green's rattling Renault lurching awkwardly toward them.

					VERNON 
		What the...?

	Gears GRINDING, tires smoking, CRABTREE fish-tails 
	wildly, then kicks open the passenger door.

					CRABTREE
		Tripp! Run!

	GRADY doesn't move an inch, watching in mute amazement as 
	CRABTREE whistles by, proceeds halfway down the block, then 
	turns back for another pass.

					VERNON
		Who the hell is that?

					GRADY
		A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon 
		girl's clutch.

	The car bucks crazily, picks up speed, and Crabtree-- 
	swiping aside a flutter of MANUSCRIPT PAGES that have taken 
	flight inside the car--begins to veer right toward Grady, 
	Vernon, and Oola.

					VERNON 
		Woah.

	Vernon steps into the street, levels the German Nine.

					VERNON (cont'd) 
		Pull off, you crazy motherfucker!

	Frantic, GRADY steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and 
	the oncoming Crabtree.

					GRADY
		No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver.

	CRABTREE fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the 
	passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a 
	FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky.

	Only, these ain't birds.  Â - ^

					GRADY
		Oh... my... God! 

	These are PAGES. Seven years of-pages.

	CRABTREE goes into another slide, one-hops the curb, and 
	smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI 
	painted on the front wail of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS.

	As Hannah Green's RADIATOR EXPLODES, CRABTREE steps free 
	of the car and looks skyward. It's a ticker-tape parade ail 
	the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of the 
	Ohio River. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
			(to Vernon)
		I take it back.  Shoot him. 

109	INT. GALAXIE - MOVING

	Vernon drives, Oola at his side. In-the back, CRABTREE 
	puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly 
	with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED 
	PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print.

					CRABTREE
		Naturally you have copies.

					GRADY
		I have an alternate version of the first 
		chapter. 

					CRABTREE
		You'll be all right then.  Look at Carlyle, 
		when he lost his luggage.

					GRADY
		That was MacCaulay.

					CRABTREE
		Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those 
		stories.

					GRADY
		He was never able to reproduce them.

					CRABTREE
		Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to 
		depreciate the loss here, but perhaps--in a 
		sense- this--
			(nodding to the pages)
		is for the best.

	Grady's eyes shift, study Crabtree.

					GRADY
		Kind of a sign, you're saying.

					CRABTREE
		In a sense.

					GRADY
		I don't think so. In my experience, signs are 
		usually a lot more subtle.

					VERNON
		Let me get this straight. All that paper that 
		went into the river. That was the only copy?

					GRADY
		'Fraid so.

					VERNON
			(glowering at Crabtree)
		And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What 
		the fuck's the matter with you?

					CRABTREE
		I'm just saying that sometimes, 
		subconsciously, a person will put themselves in 
		a situation-perhaps even create that situation-
		in order to have an arena in which to work out
		an unresolved issue. It's a covert way, if you 
		will, of addressing a problem.

	Vernon stares at CRABTREE as if he's from another planet.

					VERNON
		I'll tell you the problem. You behind the 
		wheel. There's your fucking problem.

					CRABTREE
		That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?

					VERNON
		Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights 
		in the middle of the street none of this 
		happens.

					CRABTREE
		Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun 
		to his head?

					VERNON
		He was trying to steal my car!

					GRADY
		Ail right, all right It's done. There's no 
		need to talk about it. It's done.

	They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns, 
	glances at GRADY
	and his little sheaf of pages.

					OOLA 
		So what was it about? 
			(as GRADY looks up)
		Your book.  What was the story?

	GRADY stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes.

					GRADY
		I don't know...

	Oola's brow wrinkles. CRABTREE glances at his old friend, 
	genuine compassion in his eyes.

					CRABTREE
		What he means is, it's difficult to distill 
		the essence of a book sometimes. It-lives in 
		the mind.

					VERNON
		Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, 
		right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was 
		about, why were you writing it?

					GRADY
		I couldn't stop.

110	EXT. CAMPUS ENTRANCE

	Grady, James Leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with 
	CRABTREE at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepare 
	to leave in the Galaxie.


					GRADY
		Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?

					VERNON 
		Shoot.

	GRADY glances at little round Oola.

					GRADY
		Boy or girl?

					VERNON
		As long as it looks like her, I don't care. 
		You know what I'm saying?

	GRADY watches Vernon give Oola a kiss on the forehead.

					GRADY
		Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.

					VERNON
		No sweat. Only do me a favor?

					GRADY
		Sure.

					VERNON 
		Stop calling me Vernon.

	CRABTREE leans into Grady, WHISPERS.

					CRABTREE
		The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...

					OOLA 
		Yea?

	GRADY looks at the waitress in her pink jersey dress, 
	snuggled up in the silk wedding jacket.

					GRADY
		It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had 
		small shoulders, like you. Most people don't 
		know that.

	As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head.

					VERNON
		Man, that book of yours must've been one nutty 
		motherfucking ride.

	Vernon points an imaginary gun, fires a friendly cap into 
	Grady, and pulls away. CRABTREE stands stunned.

					CRABTREE
		You mind explaining what you just did?

	GRADY watches the shrinking Galaxie sail under a drooping 
	NORDFEST BANNER, lost in thought.

					GRADY
		Came to my senses. CRABTREE

		Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is 
		James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell 
		to come to his?

					GRADY
		Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer 
		to jail, Crabs. I know that.

					CRABTREE
		Do you know he won't expel him?

					GRADY
		No. But I don't think that matters.

					CRABTREE
		That's very enlightened, Professor. It's 
		comforting to know that America's children have 
		you for a teacher.

	GRADY blinks, ponders this briefly, then looks toward the 
	buildings of the campus, his VOICE still distant.

					GRADY
		Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell 
		them what you know. You tell them to find their 
		voice and stick with it, because that's all you 
		have in the end. You tell the ones who have it 
		to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't 
		to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way 
		to get where you're going. 
			(ruefully) 
		Of course, it helps if you know where you want 
		to go. 
			(thoughtfully)
		Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara--
		that's made the last seven years worthwhile.

	GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles 
	cryptically as he considers it. -

					GRADY (cont'd)
		As for James, he doesn't need me anymore...

	Without warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		He's got you.

	CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands, 
	watches GRADY walk away.

					CRABTREE
		Me? What can I do?

					GRADY
		Gee, I don't know, Crabs...
			(over his shoulder)
		Improvise. You're good at that.

	GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as 
	he walks toward the buildings in the distance.

					CRABTREE
		I'm sorry, Tripp.

	GRADY stops, turns.

					GRADY
		You peeked, didn't you?

					CRABTREE
		I peeked. 

	GRADY considers this. Nods. It-doesn't seem to matter 
	anymore

					CRABTREE
		It really had the makings, Tripp. There was a 
		lot to admire. I've ...never read anything 
		quite like it.

	If there was a Kentucky Derby for editorial bullshit, 
	Crabtree's last three utterances would finish win, place, 
	and show. And GRADY knows it.

					GRADY
		You're not just trying to make me feel better?

	CRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend.

					CRABTREE
		Scout's honor.

	CRABTREE and GRADY stare into each other's eyes. Both are 
	acutely aware of the subtext of this conversation.

					GRADY
		Well, thanks for that, Crabs.

111	INT. HALLWAY - ENGLISH DEPARTMENT 

	Dead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the 
	stairwell, then GRADY limps into view.

112	INT. GRADY'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks.

	He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two 
	afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill 
	breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the 
	barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he-. 
	turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into his 
	pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his 
	manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half 
	length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner 
	down into a triangle along the first crease...

113	EXT. QUAD  

	A moment. Then-from the third floor window-a PAPER 
	AIRPLANE glides into view, soaring then dropping, soaring 
	then dropping, again and again, graceful as a dove.

114	INT. LOBBY - THAW HALL - LATER

	GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the 
	auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spies 
	Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER.

					GRADY
		Sara!

	Sara turns ...as the door glides shut. As GRADY hustles 
	forward, Q, wine glass in hand, intercepts him.

					Q
		Grady. I have to tell you. I took another look 
		at Arsonist's Daughter the other night. There's 
		a description of a bald cypress that left' me 
		breathless.

					GRADY
			(pushing past him)
		Thanks, Q. I felt the same way about the bank 
		teller's breasts in your last one.

115	INT. BACK ROW - AUDITORIUM - THAW HALL

	GRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way 
	behind the back row, scanning the aisles.

					GIRL'S VOICS 
		Hey, Professor Tripp.

	It's Carrie McWhirty, James' tormentor from workshop. 
	GRADY takes another look around, then drops into the seat- 
	next to her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		If you're looking for Hannah, she's on the 
		aisle.

					GRADY
		No...

	But GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the 
	aisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming. 
	The Goatee Kid sits close beside her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		Who's that guy she's with? Didn't he used to 
		be in workshop?

					GRADY
		Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango 
		dancers.

116	INT. MAIN STAGE

	Walter turns over the last page of-his prepared notes.

					WALTER
		And now, as those of you who've been with us 
		in previous years know, we have a tradition of 
		sorts here at WordFest. I'm speaking, of 
		course, of The Plums.

	An anticipatory BUZZ sweeps through the audience as 
	Walter begins to read from a separate list.

					WALTER
		This weekend, Susan Lowery, of North Braddock, 
		found a publisher for her children's book. The 
		Loneliest Prawn, Susan, stand up.

117	INT. BACK ROW - THAW HALL^

	As a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause, 
	GRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his 
	surprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the 
	front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily 
	complacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing 
	CRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shirt.

					WALTER
		And Robert Wilkenson--who many of you know for 
		his City Beat column in the Post-Gazette--has 
		found a home with Putnam for his new Three 
		Rivers thriller. Blood Patterns. Robert.

	A SHORT, BALDING MAN stands briefly then Walter's VOICE 
	takes a shift in tone.

					WALTER
		Now, this next one, I think, is especially 
		exciting to announce, because it concerns a 
		student here at the university. Our own James 
		Leer, a sophomore in English literature, has 
		found a publisher for his first novel, which I 
		believe is called The Lovely Parade.

	GRADY blinks, leans forward, and watches Walter smile 
	warmly toward the front row. CRABTREE gives James a jab in 
	the ribs and slowly, awkwardly, James rises. Stunned, 
	Carrie McWhirty turns to the GIRL next to her.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY 
		I have a class with him.

	James hangs-like a scarecrow from a nail, waiting as the 
	APPLAUSE slows, then sputters, then dies out altogether.

					CARRIE MCWHIRTY
		The guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know 
		what I mean.

	Grady, in a last attempt to save James from himself, cups 
	Hi his hands around his mouth.

					GRADY
		Take a bow, James!

	James turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish 
	grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and 
	takes his first sweet public bow.

					GRADY (cont'd) 
			(softly)
		Wonder Boy.

					WALTER
		And finally--and perhaps not least 
		importantly--Terry Crabtree, of Bartizan, has 
		also decided to publish my own book--a critical 
		exploration of the union of Marilyn Monroe and 
		Joe DiMaggio and its function in American 
		mythopoetics-which, tentatively, I've entitled 
		The Last American Marriage.     "

	Wild, obsequious APPLAUSE. GRADY smiles cynically, 
	watches Walter take a brief, dignified bow of his own.     
	. :

					WALTER 
		Until next year. Thank you, everyone.

	The LIGHTS come up. As the auditorium empties, CRABTREE 
	shakes Walter's hand and Jeff and his goatee escort Hannah 
	Green down the aisle, where she drapes her lovely arms 
	around James.

	GRADY watches them ail, sitting alone in his row, when 
	suddenly Sara appears over James' shoulder. She says 
	something congratulatory, turns, and exits out a side door. 
	GRADY blinks, scrambles up.

118	INT. CORRIDOR - THAW HALL - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY bursts into the corridor.'

					GRADY
		Sara!

	Its empty. Quiet. GRADY pauses. Somewhere, a HEAVY METAL 
	DOOR CLOSES. GRADY rushes on.

119	INT. NEW CORRIDOR

	Grady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a DOOR. He 
	moves to it, pushes past...

120	INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

	...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. He leans 
	out over the railing, peers down. It's a steep drop, very. 
	steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of 
	basement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, and 
	a COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE.

	GRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes 
	against it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, his 
	ailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of- 
	marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating 
	atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The 
	SOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're 
	Sara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing.

	It's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.

					GRADY
		Yo, Traxler.

					TRAXLER 
			(looking up)
		Hey, Professor Tripp.

	GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.

					GRADY
		Do you get high, Sam?

					TRAXLER
		Only when I'm working.

	GRADY hangs-over the railing and lets fly the Ziploc.  It 
	pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at Sam's 
	feet.

					TRAXLER 
		Holy shit. Are you serious?

					GRADY
		As a heart attack.

					TRAXLER
		Thanks-Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful ^here...

	GRADY is still hanging over the railing-but looking dizzy 
	now. His eyelids flutter and he tips forward-a Steinway on 
	a window ledge-and as he starts to drop...

	...there is a SHARP JERK on his- COLLAR, a SHIRT BUTTON 
	caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.

					SARA
		Grady, what are you doing, you idiot?

	GRADY looks up into Sara's freckled face.

					GRADY
		Looking for you.

	He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL 
	GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS...

	faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's 
	name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH 
	upward until we see that she is...

	KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.

121	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue 
	plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the 
	curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips 
	slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW 
	fall outside.

	The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then 
	the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears. 
	His NAMETAG says GREENHUT.

					GRADY
		I passed out.

					GREENHUT
		You did.

					GRADY
		I've been doing that a lot lately.

					GREENHUT
		So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of 
		marijuana, I understand.

					GRADY
		Do you think that's why I've been having 
		these...
			(grabbing James' term)
		 ... spells?

					GREENHUT
		How long have you been having them?

					GRADY
		The last month maybe.

					GREENHUT
		How long have you been smoking marijuana?

					GRADY
		Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.

					GREENHUT
		That's probably not the problem, then. What 
		about your lifestyle. Any major changes 
		recently?

					GRADY
		I've been trying to finish a book...

					GREENHUT
		And your wife left you.

					GRADY
		Is that in my chart?

					GREENHUT
		I spoke with the woman who saved your life. 
		You're lucky she came along when she did.

	GRADY considers the larger ramifications of this 
	statement

					GRADY
		I know.

					GREENHUT
			(tapping the glucose bottle)
		You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An 
		internist. And I think you really ought to 
		consider seeing a therapist, as well.

					GRADY
		She told you about. . .

					GREENHUT
		Her dog, yes.

					GRADY
		Actually, it was her husband's dog...

	Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the 
	first time, and GRADY
	stops.

					GREENHUT
		Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all 
		right? On top of that, you have a bite on your 
		ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you 
		with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another 
		day or two and you might have lost the foot. As 
		for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result 
		of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.

					GRADY
		They're anxiety attacks? That's a little 
		disappointing.

					GREENHUT
		Better luck next time.

					GRADY
		So is my friend...is Sara still here?

					GREENHUT
		No. There's no one here.

					GRADY
		I have to see her. As soon as possible.

	Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in 
	his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.

					GREENHUT
		Look, Mr. Tripp. If you really want to leave, 
		I can't stop you. But I'm going to write you a 
		prescription for a course of ampicillin and I 
		want you to follow it to the end-no matter how 
		stupid you decide to be with everything else. 
		All right?

122	INT. HOSPITAL/BRIDGE WALKWAY - AFTERNOON

	GRADY sits in a WHEELCHAIR, watching the snow fail around 
	him as a NURSE escorts him through the tunnel of glass that 
	connects one building to another.

					GRADY
		I wonder if you could show me something. 

123	EXT. NURSERY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

	GRADY stares through the glass. There are only TWO BABIES 
	on display, heads dented from natural delivery, skin purple 
	and crazy with veins.

					GRADY
		Are these the only ones you have?

	The nurse's eyes crinkle.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Kidding... 

124	EXT. GASKELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

	GRADY pays a TAXI CAB DRIVER, then turns,     looks at 
	the Gaskell house.

125	EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENT LATER

	GRADY KNOCKS. Nothing. Peers into the living room window.  
	Dark.  He stands helplessly, then spies the greenhouse, 
	standing ghostly across the yard, feathers of snow drifting 
	onto its roof, melting.

126	EXT. GREENHOUSE - MOMENT LATER12S

	GRADY hobbles to the greenhouse, puts both hands to the 
	glass as he looks inside. Quiet. Empty. Dispirited, he 
	pulls away, but not before leaving...

	...the IMPRINTS of his hands, perfectly etched in the 
	frost of the glass.

127	EXT. STREET  127

	The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the 
	street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled self 
	on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and. 
	..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little 
	pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol, 
	then looks up into the sky.

	GRADY'S POV - of the SKY... 

	...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters 
	the silence.

	NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his 
	hand.

					GRADY
			(as if addressing God) 
		Is that a suggestion?

	GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO 
	SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen 
	DS23 appears.  It passes.  Slows.  Stops. 

	GRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts 
	himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara 
	makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but- 
	not without humor. Then she rolls down the window.

					GRADY
		I'm so glad to see you, Sara.

					SARA
		I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you 
		out? Or-is this you improvising again, Grady?

					GRADY
		I'm through improvising. 

					SARA
		Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is  it true? 
		Did you lose it all?

					GRADY
		I lost it ail.

					SARA
		Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.

					GRADY
		I know.

					SARA 
		And you're old.

	Sara strokes his scalp, takes a gray hair between her 
	fingers. Yanks.

					GRADY
		Ouch. How many?

					SARA 
		Dozens. It's very sad.

	Sara smiles at Grady, but the mischief leaves her eyes 
	when she looks into his, and-she glances away.

					GRADY
		I went and looked at-some babies just now.

					SARA
		Oh?

					GRADY
			(trying to make her laugh)
		I guess you have to go on faith.

					SARA
			(she doesn't)
		Some times...

	GRADY studies her as she traces her finger around the 
	HOSPITAL BRACELET still encircling his wrist.

					GRADY
		Did you tell Walter?

					SARA
		I told Walter. 

					GRADY
		Does he still love you?

					SARA
		It didn't come up. 

	GRADY studies Sara's freckled cheeks, her anxious 
	profile, then turns her chin gently toward him.

					GRADY
		Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I 
		didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been 
		waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're 
		who I need. Because nothing makes sense without 
		you. Because the best moment of every day is 
		the moment I first see your face. And because 
		when you leave a room, there's no reason to be 
		in it any more. It's just a room again.

	Sara cocks her head.

					SARA 
		Did you just make that up?

					GRADY
			(shaking his head)
		In the hospital. I "was kind of excited about 
		it at-the time, but then I was on pretty heavy 
		painkillers.

	She frowns good-naturedly. 

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Even so...it's still true. Every word.

	Sara just nods, looks away, her face unreadable.

					GRADY (cont'd)
		Sara, I promise, even though commonsense might 
		tell you...

	Sara turns, puts a finger on GRADY's lips...

					SARA 
		Don't write a page when a paragraph will do.

	GRADY nods, takes her hand. Looks at it as he speaks.

					GRADY
		You don't deserve me, you know.

					SARA
		I know, but sometimes... 

	Sara turns, looks at Grady. Her eyes are glistening. 

					SARA (cont'd) 
		You just go on faith.

	GRADY looks into her eyes, then rises, and we do too, 
	drifting above the streetlights as GRADY limps to the other 
	side of the car and gets in. As GRADY snaps shut his door, 
	the car drifts off, gradually losing itself in- the soft 
	veil of falling snow. After a moment, GRADY and Sara are 
	lost too, nothing more than a blur.


	THE END

                                                    October 18th, 2007

          

          IN THE BEGINNING...       1

          
          BLACK an infinite void but at the center a SINGULARITY, a
          particle infinitely small and infinitely dense that contains
          all the potential matter and energy in the universe.

          THE BIG BANG
          A blinding flash of light as the singularity explodes,
          particles expanding in all directions until they fill the
          screen, a shimmering cloud of electromagnetic dust.
          Then the particles start to attract one another to form
          atoms, the atoms elements, the elements form molecules, the
          molecules compounds, the compounds cells, then a cell
          twitches and a PRIMITIVE DRUM starts booming out a Dolby
          heartbeat as we witness the rapid evolution of organisms.
          Then a big fish swims by and is suddenly swallowed whole by a
          much bigger fish, and we rapidly rise from the depths and
          pull back to reveal--

          THE SEA                   2
          Vast, blue, rolling toward the shore, brilliant sun rising in
          a cloudless azure sky.
          A WOMAN emerges from the sea like Aphrodite, strongly backlit
          to obscure her nudity, but we can see she is full-breasted,
          long-limbed, toned and tanned-- perfection. Then a MAN rises
          up out of the water beside her, and staggers clumsily in the
          surf. Even in silhouette we can see he's far from perfect--
          short, overweight. They turn to each other and embrace.
          It's paradise-- for him.

          THE WOMAN
          (looking deep in his eyes)
          I'm so hungry.

          THE MAN
          (wanting her)
          Yeah. Me, too.
          The DRUMS get hotter as he closes his eyes and leans in to
          kiss her, but she turns and walks away.

          WOMAN
          What should we eat?

          THE MAN
          Oh, you actually meant you were
          hungry. I thought-- forget it.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                     2.
          He follows her.
          They walk toward the trees that fringe the beach. When they
          reach the line of vegetation, the woman, MAYA, kneels, pulls
          berries from a bush and pops them in her mouth.
          The man, ZED, grabs a handful of berries and they squat there
          noshing like Adam and Eve.

          THE WOMAN
          Mmmm, these are so good.

          THE MAN
          Mmrrunm, they really are .
          When she turns away he spits them out in disgust.
          Maya smiles and puts her face very close to his, their lips
          almost touching.

          MAYA
          (very sexy)
          You know what I'd really like?

          ZED

          (HOPEFULLY)
          What?

          MAYA
          Some fruit.

          ZED
          (frustrated, but hanging

          IN                                                              )
          Yeah, fruit's good.
          (he stands up)
          You want an apple or a pear?

          MAYA

          (THINKS)
          No.
          He scans the nearby trees.

          ZED
          Orange? Tangerine?
          (she shakes her head)
          Umm, mango? Kiwi? Peach?
          She shakes her head coyly.
          He starts darting from tree to tree, hopefully pointing out
          various options. She follows him.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                      3.

          Plum? Nectarine? Passion fruit?

          MAYA

          (COQUETTISHLY)
          Nuh-uh.

          ZED
          (fake smile)
          Okay, don't tell me-- papaya?
          Pomegranate? Lemon? Lime?
          Kumquat? Uh, cock? Cockfruit?

          MAYA

          NOOO--
          The game is no longer cute but he still plays along.

          ZED
          Watermelon? Honeydew? Grapes?

          MAYA

          NOOO--

          ZED
          (this is a lot of work to
          get laid)
          Starfruit, casaba-- tangelo?

          MAYA
          Nope.

          ZED
          (he doesn't even like her

          ANYMORE)
          Okay, I give up. Which fruit do
          you want?

          MAYA

          (POINTS)
          That one.
          Zed looks. It's a beautiful tree with lush, apple-like   red
          fruit hanging from it.

          ZED

          (SCOFFS)
          Yeah, right. Okay.

          MAYA
          Why not?

          

          

          

          
          Official white                                                           4.

          ZED
          Because that's the fruit we don't
          eat! It's forbidden.

          MAYA
          Why not?

          ZED
          Because we don't! It's a rule!
          That's the Tree of the Knowledge of
          Good and Evil. You don't eat from
          that one. Nobody ever has.

          MAYA
          Why not?

          ZED
          Stop saying why not! I told you--
          it's a rule.

          MAYA
          So do you always follow the rules?

          ZED
          No-- yeah-- I don't know. We don't
          have that many rules. In fact, we
          only have one rule-- DON'T EAT THAT

          FRUIT.

          MAYA
          Okay, fine. We won't. Forget I
          mentioned it. I understand if
          you're afraid--

          ZED
          I'm not "afraid"--

          MAYA
          No, really, it's all right. I just
          thought you might be curious why we
          can eat everything else that walks,
          crawls, swims, flies, or grows in
          the ground, but not that particular
          fruit. And I thought you might be
          the kind of man who's willing to
          take a chance and start thinking
          for himself, but I guess I was
          wrong.
          She glares defiantly at Zed, then starts to walk away. It's
          not Paradise anymore. Then like every man that ever lived
          and will ever live, he caves.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             5.

          ZED
          Okay! Fine! You want to try the
          Good and Evil fruit, you got it.
          He rips two ripe fruits from a low-hanging bough and hands
          her one. They both stare at the fruit.

          MAYA
          You first.

          ZED
          No way! It was your idea. You go
          first.

          MAYA
          We both bite at the same time.
          Zed considers for a long moment then decides.

          ZED
          Okay. Ready? One-- two-- three!
          Zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite, but Maya fakes him
          out and stops before her teeth break the skin.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (with his mouth full)
          Got me. That's a good move. I'm
          going to steal it.
          He starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste
          of Good and Evil. Then his face contorts in disgust and he
          spits it out.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (gagging and spitting)
          Yuchh! That's horrible. Yecch,
          ptui! Ughh.
          He frantically wipes the inside of his mouth with his
          fingers, trying to get the terrible taste out.

          MAYA
          So you're saying it's not good?

          ZED
          Yes! I'm saying it's not good!
          He grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp. Then a
          loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Oh, no--

          Official White
          He runs for the bushes. Maya's attention gets diverted.

          Ooh, banana!

          A TRIBE OF PRIMITIVE CAUCASIANS. Dozens of huts surround a
          mmunal fire pit where WOMEN in loincloths roll flatbread        CO
          and cook it on heated rocks. The drums start pounding out a
          celebratory rhythm as the HUNTERS enter carrying a DEAD BOAR
          on a pole, their faces marked with boar's blood, ritual signs
          in honor of the kill.
          The lead hunter MARLAK, is a hulking thug with a bony,
          Neanderthal forehead. He cuts off the boar's head and drops
          it at Maya's feet.

          MARLAK

          Zed is lying on a pad of animal hides in front of his hut,
          his guts still aching. His best friend OH sits next to him
          sewing skins together, watching the hunters with envy,
          jealous of the attention they're getting from the women.
          If Zed is over-confident and reckless, Oh is his polar
          opposite, nervous and risk-averse, the kind of guy who would
          apologize if you poked him in the ass with your spear. He
          may, in fact, be near-sighted and if glasses had been
          invented he'd be wearing them.

          OH

          (GRUMBLING)
          Look at them. Hunters think
          they're so cool. They don't think
          gathering is dangerous? There are
          thorns-- bees-- those big stingy
          ants. I could hunt-- I just don't
          want to. And what's with the blood
          on their faces? They think that's
          sanitary?

          (miserable with pain)
          Do me a favor. Just kill me.

          OH
          Why did you eat that fruit? It's
          forbidden. Everybody knows that.

          ZED
          I couldn't help myself! Maya was
          just staring at me with those pouty
          eyes-- and those perky breasts--
          opposable thumbs. And how about
          the name? "The Tree of the
          Knowledge of Good and Evil"? You
          don't think that sounds tempting?
          They should've just called it "The
          Tree with the Fruit that Tastes
          Like Shit." Then for sure nobody
          would eat it.
          Zed notices a VILLAGER squatting in the bushes right behind
          his dwelling.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (shouts testily)
          Hey! Squanto! Give me a break,
          would ya'! You got the whole
          forest!
          (to Oh)
          Why does everyone have to crap
          right behind my hut?

          OH
          I think, and I could be wrong, that
          all the poop makes the ground more
          fertile, which in turn, gives the
          leaves in the area a softer feel.
          It's a vicious circle.
          Oh notices a very pretty young woman, EEMA, standing near the
          communal fire with TWO HUNTERS. His heart leaps.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)
          (calls out eagerly)
          Hi, Eema!
          Eema turns, sees it's him and gives him a perfunctory wave,
          then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh
          that makes them laugh.

          She doesn't even know I exist.

          (LOVE-STRUCK)
          I want to lay with her so badly.

          ZED
          I don't see it. I mean she's cute,
          but I don't think I'd lay with her.

          OH
          Of course not! She's your sister!
          It'd be like sleeping with your
          mother.

          ZED
          which was a big mistake. I see
          that now. You think it won't be
          awkward the next morning but--
          trust me, you just want to rip your
          eyeballs out.
          (shakes off the memory)
          Listen, if you want to impress
          Eema, tonight at the feast, do the
          fertility dance with her, then drag
          her back to your hut.

          OH
          My hut's a mess. And what if she
          struggles?

          ZED
          So you give her a little tap on the
          head. Women respond to that--

          OH

          (SIGHS)
          No. She only likes hunters-- not
          gatherers.
          They look over at Eema, who is now slowly stroking the shaft
          of a hunter's spear.

          ZED
          I wouldn't read too much into that.
          She kisses, then tongues the spear tip.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)
          Okay, that might mean something.
          The hunter Marlak walks by and stops. He's clearly half a
          rung lower on the human evolutionary scale.

          MARLAK
          You didn't hunt today.

          ZED
          Yes, Marlak. Very observant. I
          was indisposed. Got that
          intestinal thing that's been going
          around.
          Marlak grunts and examines the primitive line drawings on the
          walls of Zed's hut.

          MARLAK
          (points at a drawing)
          What's that supposed to be?

          ZED
          It's a bear.

          MARLAK
          That's not a bear. That's just
          some lines on a skin.

          ZED

          (SIGHS)
          It's not a real bear. It's a
          "representation" of a bear. You
          know, a "picture."

          MARLAK
          That's stupid.

          ZED
          Yeah. Like you'd know.

          MARLAK
          And what's that?
          He picks up a skin with another of Zed's drawings on it, this
          one of a big-breasted naked girl. Zed quickly grabs it and
          holds it upside down.

          ZED
          That-- would be an antelope-- or a
          deer-- a deerpalope.

          MARLAK
          (trying to look at it
          upside down)
          It looks like Maya.

          ZED
          (hides it away)
          How could it be Maya? It's just
          some lines on a skin.

          MARLAK
          Stay away from my woman.

          ZED
          Your woman? I'm not sure dragging
          her into the bushes kicking and
          screaming means you have an actual
          "thing" going.
          Marlak cuffs him hard on the side of the head.

          MARLAK
          (walking off)
          Stay away.

          The DRUMS kick up another notch as the huge boar roasts on a
          spit over a roaring fire.

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          The tribe is gathered around the big fire pit. The tribe's
          SHAMAN, their medicine man and spirit leader, dances around
          the fire in a boar's head mask, accessorized with way too
          many bones, beads and feathers.
          Zed and Oh are sitting near the fire, smoking something in a
          long, decorated pipe.

          ZED
          Hey, Oh? Did it ever occur to you
          that there may be more to life than
          this?

          --but why? What's the point?

          OH
          You always get like this when you
          smoke.
          Oh takes a big toke on the pipe, chokes, and starts coughing
          uncontrollably.

          ZED
          No. Last night I couldn't sleep,
          so I just laid there looking up at
          the sky, counting the stars. There
          were over seventy. Kinda makes you
          think, doesn't it?

          (looks up at the sky)
          No.

          ZED
          Really? I've been thinking about
          it ever since I ate that fruit.
          Don't you ever wonder what's on the
          other side of the mountains?

          OH
          There's nothing on the other side
          of the mountains. Everybody knows
          that. The world just ends. You'd
          fall right off the edge.
          (makes a sharp gesture)

          ZED
          But what if it doesn't? What if it
          just goes on and on forever? Or
          what if it's round?
          (he picks up a round

          ROCK))
          And if you keep walking you
          eventually come right back to where
          you started?

          Oh, yeah, that's plausible.

          Oww!

          Sorry!

          Will you stop with that crazy talk?
          We're at a feast. You love feasts.
          There's women, there's boar meat,
          there's an assortment of berries--
          there's women--
          Oh looks over at Eema. Zed picks up on it.

          ZED
          Do it, man! Go dance for her.

          OH
          You think? They're playing the
          Jackal Dance. I don't do that one
          so well.

          ZED
          Are you kidding? Go! Jackal
          Dance!
          Oh summons his courage, gets up and crosses to where the
          girls are sitting.
          Zed makes subtle eye contact with Maya, waggles his eyebrows
          and licks his lips. She laughs and looks away.
          Oh starts dancing timidly right in front of Eema, subtly
          jerking his pelvis, trying to be cool.
          Eema just stares at him for a moment, then goes back to
          talking to her friends. Oh looks over at Zed for help.
          Zed mimes clonking her on the head.
          Oh picks up a wooden club and hits Eema right on the noggin.
          However, instead of submitting, she gets really pissed,
          stands up and decks him with one punch.

          A hunter is slicing off hunks of boar meat for the other
          tribesmen. Zed pushes through the small crowd waiting for
          food and goes to the front.

          ZED
          Excuse me, hunter coming through.

          VILLAGERS
          Hey! Wait your turn! There's a
          line here, buddy!

          ZED
          For your information I was in line
          and I just stepped out to chew some
          food for an elderly lady.
          Suddenly a SPEAR is thrust inches from his face, stopping
          him. It's Marlak, who towers over Zed. His cohort,
          ENMEBARAGESI, short and stout, stands beside him.

          MARLAK
          Enmebaragesi said he saw you in the
          garden with Maya.

          ZED
          Oh, really? And what if I called
          Enmebaragesi a liar?

          ENMEBARAGESI
          I'd kill you.

          ZED
          Calm down. I said "what                                     if"-- it
          was a hypothetical.
          Marlak gets right in Zed's face.

          MARLAK
          Enmebaragesi doesn't lie.
          Villagers gather around them, Maya and Eema among them.
          Marlak puts his spear point to Zed's throat.
          MARLAK (cont'd)
          The truth!

          Zed, just admit it. You're just
          making it harder on yourself.

          (instantly annoyed)
          No, you just made it harder on
          myself!

          Okay, fine, you got me.
          (gingerly moves the spear

          POINT)
          Maya and I lay together on
          occasion. We're consenting adults
          and we have an adventurous sexual
          relationship.
          Maya looks shocked, and tries to signal Zed to shut up.

          MARLAK

          (STUNNED)
          You laid with my woman?

          ZED
          Isn't that what we're talking
          about?
          Maya rolls her eyes.

          ENMEBARAGESI
          No, I saw you eat the Forbidden
          Fruit.

          ZED
          Oh, that! Yeah! I did eat the
          fruit. I was just kidding about
          humping Maya.
          Marlak knocks Zed to the ground. The DRUMMING stops.
          Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and Zed.

          Zed gets to his feet.

          ZED
          Look, Marlak, this is crazy.
          You're two of me. I'm not gonna
          fight you over a girl, okay?
          Zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a WILD
          HAYMAKER at Marlak who easily ducks it, and it hits an
          unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose.
          Zed                                                            (cont'd)

          And let that be a lesson to your
          big friend-
          Marlak grabs Zed, lands two solid punches to Zed's mid-
          section, and then clocks him with a vicious right that sends
          him sprawling to the ground.

          MARLAK
          (standing over Zed)
          Your father was a great hunter, but
          you're like-- a girl.
          The hunters laugh.

          ENMEBARAGESI
          Good one, Marlak.

          ANOTHER HUNTER
          Zing.

          MARLAK
          Now I kill you.
          He's about to spear Zed when suddenly the Shaman screams and
          jumps between them. The villagers step back as the Shaman
          howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at Zed.

          SHAMAN
          (leaning close to Zed)
          We need to talk.

          Zed and the Shaman sit side by side on a log, talking
          privately.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                         16.
          The Shaman is covered in skins, feathers, bones, beads,
          animal teeth, antlers and horns, his hair a mass of long,
          muddy dreadlocks, his face painted, his cheeks, nose, and
          ears pierced by shards of bone. But if not for his
          outlandish getup, zed could be talking to his pastor.

          SHAMAN
          You really ate the fruit?

          ZED
          One bite! What's the big deal?

          SHAMAN
          (halfheartedly shakes a
          chicken-foot rattle at

          HIM)
          You don't eat the fruit! That's
          been the number one rule from the
          beginning of time. Since the Great
          Turtle climbed from the sea with
          the Earth on his back, drank the
          ocean, pooped out the mountains and
          the first man fell from the stars.

          ZED
          I've always had trouble with the
          Great Turtle Theory-- too many
          unexplained gaps.

          SHAMAN
          Whatever. You're screwed now.

          ZED
          Really? How screwed? Like I knew
          it was a rule but I'm a little
          fuzzy on the exact details.

          SHAMAN
          You're cursed, man, and if you stay
          here then we'll all be cursed. You
          have to leave.

          ZED
          Where am I supposed to go?

          SHAMAN
          Up to you. From now on you're
          completely on your own.

          ZED

          (DEFIANT)
          Oh, really?

          Am I detecting a little jealousy
          here because I now have the
          knowledge of good and evil and you
          don't? Well, you know what? I say
          what I did was a good thing-- a
          very very good thing-- and I'm not
          leaving. What do you think of
          that?
          A HUMAN SKULL comes flying in from off-camera and lands at
          his feet.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Okay, is that supposed to be funny?
          He stands up and we see that the whole tribe is standing
          around them in a wide circle.
          Marlak bangs his spear on the edge of his animal-hide shield,
          starting a rhythmical beat. The other hunters join in,
          keeping the beat, staring at Zed with lethal intent

          SHAMAN
          (to Zed, re the hunters)
          You should probably get going now.
          You better take this knife.
          He hands him a flint knife with a leather-wrapped handle.
          SHAMAN                                                          (cont'd)
          And some of the guys got together
          and they want you to have this bow.
          He hands him a strong hunter's bow.

          ZED
          I don't want to seem ungrateful or
          anything, but you wouldn't happen
          to have any arrows, would you?
          An arrow zips in and sticks in the post next to his head.

          SHAMAN
          (to Zed)
          You'd better get moving.
          Zed looks around at his fellow villagers, trying to summon
          what dignity he has left.

          ZED

          (DEFIANT)
          Okay, but before I go I just want
          to say something. I know I'm not
          the greatest hunter--

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             18.

          VILLAGER (O.S.)
          --Or gatherer--

          ZED
          Yes, or gatherer-- but there's got
          to be more to life than this--
          (to Hunters)
          Kinda hard to concentrate with that
          rhythmic drumming, fellas.
          The Hunters keep the insistent beat, their gaze fixed on Zed.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (rolls his eyes; "these
          guys are hopeless")
          Anyways, I'm going away, not
          because you're forcing me to--
          which you are-- but because I
          choose to. Yes, I ate from the
          Tree of the Knowledge of Good and
          Evil-- major misunderstanding on my
          part-- and believe me I'm not
          recommending it unless you're
          interested in a very powerful
          laxative-- but it got me thinking
          about some pretty heavy stuff --
          life questions, you know. So I'm
          out of here, and anyone who wants
          to join me is welcome.
          He looks around the circle and sees Maya. She sees Marlak
          staring at her and averts her eyes.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)

          ANYONE--
          Zed looks at oh, who suddenly becomes very interested in an
          imaginary piece of loincloth lint.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (looks directly at Oh)
          I don't know where we're going or
          when we're going to get there, but
          I will lead the way--
          (he picks up a burning

          TORCH)
          lighting up the darkness-- pointing
          us in the right direction, and
          keeping us entertained with
          humorous anecdotes from my
          childhood. Now who's with me?
          He enthusiastically thrusts the torch in the air.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                               19.
          Oh looks at Eema, then at Zed, and lowers his eyes.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)
          Okay, then I guess I'll just have
          to go it alone, which is fine with

          ME--
          (to Oh)
          --better, in fact, because having a
          partner would just slow me down.
          Oh can't look at him.
          Zed shakes his head, failing to notice that the torch he's
          holding has ignited the roof of the hut next to him.
          The Shaman shouts and points at the now blazing roof.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)
          Oops!
          They all stare as the fire quickly leaps from roof to roof.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)
          I know there's a lesson in here
          somewhere. Any thoughts?
          The villagers scream and run off to try and save their huts.
          It's chaos.

          MARLAK
          (raises his spear, to Zed)
          Now you die.
          Marlak throws his spear and misses as Zed takes off running
          into the forest with the hunters right behind him and the
          whole village ablaze.

          CUT TO:

          8                                                              EXT. FOREST   - NIGHT   8

          Zed runs for his life through the dense forest.
          The hunters chase him, shooting arrows at him on a dead run.
          Zed dodges as the arrows zip around him. He veers left, then
          right, then trips and tumbles down a muddy embankment.
          The hunters stop at the top of the embankment. Marlak
          listens for sounds of movement in the forest below, then
          silently signals for the hunters to fan out.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                            20.
          Marlak nimbly makes his way down the embankment, reaches the
          bottom and sees something in the moonlight.
          It's Zed lying on the ground, badly camouflaged with sticks
          and leaves, thinking he can't be seen, but the shape of his
          body is clearly discernible. Marlak raises his spear.

          MARLAK
          I see you.

          ZED
          (long beat)
          No, you don't.

          MARLAK
          Yes, I do.

          ZED
          How can you see me if I'm not here?

          MARLAK
          You're trying to trick me.

          ZED
          Okay, then tell me this-- who's
          standing right behind you?

          MARLAK
          (nobody's fool)
          You think I'm going to turn around
          and look, but I'm not.
          (pulls his knife)
          I'm going to gut you like a pig.
          He is about to plunge his knife into Zed when suddenly he is
          struck from behind by a heavy tree branch. He falls heavily,
          knocked senseless by Oh who is standing over him with the
          makeshift club.
          Zed sits up and smiles gratefully at Oh.

          OH
          I guess I'm with you.

          ZED
          Was it my speech?

          OH
          No, the fire. I lost everything.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                       21.

          ZED
          But the speech was pretty good,
          right? I mean, even I was moved
          and I was the one speaking.

          OH
          Can we talk about this later?
          Oh pulls Zed to his feet, and they sneak off into the deep
          woods.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          CRICKETS. Zed and Oh walk through the moonlit forest.

          ZED
          This is nice, out here, the two of
          us.

          OH

          (SULLEN)
          Yeah, it's great.

          ZED
          Come on, those hunters are idiots.
          In an hour they'll forget the whole
          thing.

          OH
          I don't think they'll forget the
          fire.

          ZED
          You know what we should do? You
          and me should kill the biggest boar
          ever-- just huge!-- and take it
          back to the village. Just to show
          them. And we won't let anyone else
          eat it. They'll have to watch us
          eat it.

          OH
          If it's that huge how would we
          carry it back?

          ZED

          (CONSIDERING)
          Fine, we'll just start with
          something small. A squirrel or
          something.

          OH
          Yeah, we'll make everyone watch us
          eat a squirrel. Will you get real?
          There's no going back! There's,
          nothing to go back to! It's just
          ashes.

          ZED

          (SCOFFS)
          Yeah, like it's so hard to build a
          new hut. It's just a pile of
          sticks and dung--

          OH

          (SCOWLS)
          You're a pile of sticks and dung.
          Suddenly, Zed stops and stands perfectly still.

          ZED
          (through clenched teeth)
          Oh!

          OH
          What are you doing?
          Zed makes a minimal gesture with his head. Oh looks up.
          A COUGAR crouches on a tree limb above them, poised to leap.
          Oh freezes. They talk like ventriloquists.

          ZED
          Don't move a muscle.

          OH
          Will that work?

          ZED
          (without moving his lips)
          I don't know. There's two
          different opinions on this one.
          Some say run, some say don't.

          OH
          What are you going to do?

          ZED
          I'm going to-- RUN!
          He sprints off and the cougar pounces right on oh.

          Zed is holding a stick over the fire, cooking what looks like
          a squirrel or a muskrat.
          Oh comes out of the forest carrying a huge armload of sticks
          and branches. One of Oh's sticks falls, and as he carefully
          reaches down to grab it, the rest spill out on the ground.
          Oh sighs. His body is covered with long claw marks.

          ZED
          You really should put some maggots
          on those scratches. They look
          pretty deep.

          OH

          (BITTER)
          I just want to know why you told me
          not to move, and you ran.

          ZED
          Because I honestly thought he'd go
          for me. I thought I was doing you
          a favor. Apparently not
          appreciated.

          OH
          Yeah, big favor.

          ZED
          You didn't have to come with me,
          you know. I didn't ask you to
          come.

          OH
          Yes, you did! You looked right at
          me-- twice.

          ZED
          Yes, that's a technique of public
          speaking, but I didn't ask you
          specifically. You chose to come.
          You gotta take some responsibility
          for that. And there's no point
          coming if you're just gonna keep
          whining about every little-- cougar
          that attacks you.
          (pulls the cooked rodent
          from the fire)
          You want some or not?

          OH

          (HUFFY)
          No, eat your weasel. You deserve
          it.
          He turns his back to Zed, and starts sorting through the pile
          of sticks.

          ZED
          You making your own fire?

          OH
          No, arrows. We're going to need
          them.

          ZED
          (perks up)
          You're still coming?

          OH

          (RESIGNED)
          Yes.
          Zed claps him on the back and hugs him exuberantly. Oh

          Zed and Oh are hiking uphill, the lush, dense verdure of the
          forest now thinning to evergreens and mountain heather.

          Zed and Oh climbing higher now. Finally, they reach the top
          and look out at the vista.
          From their vantage point they can see a high plateau and
          wooded land stretching far beyond it.

          ZED

          (GLOATING)
          I knew it! Still think you're just

          OH
          (in amazement)
          Incredible.
          He takes a step forward, the rock shelf gives way beneath his
          feet and he falls a great distance, screaming all the way
          down, bouncing painfully off the big boulders, then a long,
          tumbling slide over sharp rocks and gravel to the bottom.

          Oooh.                                                           -

          Zed is following a trail downhill through the forest on the
          other side of the mountains. Oh is limping along behind him,
          bitten, clawed, cut, scraped and bruised.

          ZED
          Say what you want, but that was no
          accident. You don't see a pattern
          here?

          OH
          I see a pattern. Every time
          something terrible can happen to
          me, it does.

          ZED
          Yeah, but why? Why'd the cougar go
          for you and not me? Why did you
          fall and I didn't? Hard to believe

          He drops to one knee and examines something in the bushes.
          Zed                                                             (cont'd)
          They stopped here to poop. Look.

          OH
          No, thank you.

          ZED
          Four men, maybe five. And a child--
          or a small women maybe.

          Okay.

          ZED
          (poking at the evidence)
          Looks like they had some nuts--
          dried fruit-- some kind of green
          leafy vegetable--

          OH
          Okay! Enough! Can we just go?
          Maybe we can find where they peed.

          stealthily to the tree line. Oh creeps up beside him and
          they peer through the bushes.
          THREE COWS are grazing in a green pasture. Beyond it, well-
          tended fields of growing grain.
          Zed snaps into stalking mode, ducks down and silently signals
          Oh to be quiet and stay put.

          ZED

          (WHISPERS)
          This one's mine.
          He takes his bow, pulls an arrow from his quiver, and slowly
          draws the bow, taking deadly aim at one of the cows. He
          shoots.
          The blunt, pointless arrow hits the cow in the side and
          bounces off. The cow looks up.

          

          

          

          
                                                                        Official White              27.

          (to Oh)
          We're gonna need some arrowheads.
          Zed draws his flint knife, then suddenly bursts out of the
          forest, dashes toward the cow and leaps on its back.
          Oh comes running up as the cow bucks and sends Zed flying.
          Lying on the ground, Zed looks up and sees TWO SURPRISED
          YOUNG FARMERS dressed in simple white woolen tunics staring
          at him.

          FIRST YOUNG FARMER
          Did you just shoot my cow?

          ZED
          (getting painfully to his

          FEET)
          Yeah, well-- we're hunters.

          OH
          (covering for himself)
          He's a hunter. I'm more of a
          "maker." I made this loincloth, I
          do arrows-- I made a shelf unit for
          my hut--

          ZED
          What do you guys do?

          SECOND YOUNG FARMER
          What does it look like? We're
          farmers.

          FIRST YOUNG FARMER
          He's a farmer; I'm a herdsman.

          SECOND YOUNG FARMER
          You're a suck, is what you are.

          FIRST YOUNG FARMER
          (ignores him)
          My brother, Cain. I am called
          Abel.

          You are called suck.

          looked on my sacrifice with favor.

          "God looked on my sacrifice with

          Okay, is he a total suck or what?

          OH
          Well, it's hard to say-- we just

          MET--

          ABEL
          Why are you dragging them into
          this? What do they know? They're
          morons.

          ZED

          (OFFENDED)
          Hey! Easy!

          CAIN
          (to Abel)
          You think you're so superior to
          everyone else.

          ABEL
          Superior-er than you.

          CAIN
          Really? Let's see how good you are
          at getting your ass kicked.
          (shoves him)

          ABEL
          Yeah? Bring it!

          No! This smug asshole insulted you

          Make me!
          Zed steps between them, trying to make peace.

          ZED
          Boys, boys! You're brothers!
          Let's just relax and--
          Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight
          is on. They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and
          wrestle each other to the ground.

          OH
          Shouldn't we do something?

          ZED
          Just let them settle it.
          Cain picks up a good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head
          with all his might. Abel falls heavily to the ground and
          lies there, not moving. Cain stands over him, breathing
          hard.

          still holding the bloody

          ROCK)
          What?!

          ZED
          Nothing!
          Cain stares at Abel, still inert on the ground.

          CAIN
          He's all right. Probably just

          RESTING--

          fight.

          You could've stopped me! There's
          two of you and only one of me.

          and he-- accidentally ran into it--
          really hard-- with his head.

          Okay-- yeah-- good. But it might
          be better if we don't mention the
          "accident" to anyone. People might
          get the wrong idea. Understand?

          Cain finishes loading bushels of grain onto an oxcart while
          Zed and Oh closely inspect the big, heavy, solid wooden
          wheels on the cart.

          ZED
          What are the big round things for?

          CAIN
          They're wheels, numbskull. They
          make the cart roll.

          (to Cain)
          Your sister Lilith said she saw him
          in the field with you.

          CAIN
          I think that was yesterday.

          ADAM
          No, this day. She said you both
          made offerings.

          CAIN
          That might've been Boaz---

          ADAM
          No, you and Abel. She said it
          looked like you were arguing.

          CAIN
          Hey, we're brothers, we argue
          sometimes- it's not that big a
          deal.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                           34.

          ADAM
          And his flock was untended in the

          PASTURE--

          CAIN

          (EXPLODES)
          Okay! What am I-- his keeper? Get
          off my back, will you?
          He smashes his plate against the wall and storms out. An
          awkward silence as Zed and Oh exchange guilty looks.

          ADAM
          I fear the worst for Abel. I am
          sorely vexed.

          ZED
          Yeah, that's got to be pretty
          vexing.
          A Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly
          on his sorry circumstances.

          ADAM
          For my sin the ground is cursed.
          Thorns and thistles does it sprout
          for us, and we are doomed to toil
          all the days of our lives. For as
          the Lord has commanded, by the
          sweat of your brow shall you get
          bread to eat until you return to
          the ground from which you were
          taken. For dust you are, and to
          dust shall you return.

          ZED
          Wow. That's kind of a downer isn't
          it?

          ADAM
          It's the way of the world.

          ZED
          Boy, I hope not.

          ADAM
          (rises abruptly)
          You are welcome to stay the night
          and lay with my daughter Lilith.
          Zed looks at the luscious Lilith, then back at Adam.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                   35.

          ZED
          I'm waiting for the punchline.

          ADAM
          She is without a husband, and as
          the Lord has said, thou shalt be
          fruitful and multiply.
          Lilith nods demurely and exits through a curtain. Zed starts
          to follow her out.

          OH
          Hey! What about me?

          ADAM
          You may share the bed of my son
          Seth.

          ZED
          Yeah, there you go.
          (he exits)
          Oh looks at Seth.

          SETH
          I multiplied with a sheep.
          (Oh just stares at him)
          My thingie smells like lamb chops.

          Zed enters the room. Lilith reclines on a cot with a straw
          mattress.

          LILITH
          (making room on the cot)
          My bed is small but you're welcome
          to share it. It's the way of my
          people.

          ZED
          (lying down beside her)
          And that's a good way to be. In
          fact, I'm kind of surprised a
          pretty girl like you is sleeping
          alone anyway. I would've thought
          guys would be lined up at the door.

          LILITH
          I don't like men.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                 36.

          ZED
          (moving closer)
          Maybe you just haven't met the
          right one.

          LILITH
          I like girls.

          ZED

          (SUAVE)
          So we have that in common--

          LILITH
          (stares at him for a beat)
          I'm attracted to women.

          ZED
          (a beat)
          I don't even know what that means.
          What does that mean?

          LILITH
          I like to have sex with other
          women.

          ZED
          (stares at her for a long

          MOMENT)
          I'm really not getting this.
          Lilith shakes her head, turns away from him, and pulls up her
          blanket. Zed shrugs and rolls over to sleep. They lie there
          quietly in the dark for a long beat. Then--
          Zed                                                             (cont'd)

          Oh is lying next to Seth, wide-awake, trying to stay as far
          away from him as possible.

          SETH
          Oooh, listen to this one.
          Seth lifts his knees to his chest and farts a surprisingly
          long cadenza.

          OH
          That's really good.

          SETH

          In the yard behind the house, Oh is helping Cain as he chops
          firewood with a metal axe. Oh now wears a tunic like the
          farmers.

          CAIN
          It's been the same damn thing my
          whole life.
          (swings the axe-- thwack!)
          "Why can't you be more like Abel?"
          (thwack!)
          "Oh, your sacrifice was good, too,
          but Abel's was-- wow!"
          (thwack!)

          OH
          (trying to change the

          SUBJECT)
          Your brother Seth is an interesting
          guy. Did you know he can put his
          penis in his mouth?
          Adam and Zed come out of his dwelling.
          KINSMEN from other dwellings start gathering.

          ADAM
          Cain!

          CAIN
          Yeah, hey-- where's everybody
          going?

          ADAM
          To look for Abel.

          CAIN

          (MUTTERS)
          Good luck.

          ADAM
          What did you say?

          CAIN
          (louder, mock sincerity)
          I said good luck. I'm really
          worried about him.
          He turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for Oh's
          benefit.

          ADAM
          You're not coming?

          CAIN
          Yeah, I am. I just have to finish
          toiling over here, then I'm right
          behind you.
          Adam and the others hurry off, and as soon as they're gone,
          Cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to the cart.
          CAIN                                                           (cont'd)
          (to Zed and Oh)
          Now listen, I'm getting out of
          here, and you better come with me.
          I have a feeling they're going to
          try and blame this whole "Abel-
          killing-thing" on you.

          ZED
          Why would they blame us?

          CAIN
          Because when they find him and his
          head is all bashed in, they're
          going to start pointing fingers,
          and you guys are drifters, so
          they'll put two and two together
          and that makes--
          He stares expectantly at Zed and Oh.

          Four! It makes four! Now stop
          asking so many questions and hop
          on. We gotta get out of here!

          lumbers forward.

          Adam and the other farmers jump onto two more oxcarts and set
          out after Cain, Zed and Oh.

          Cain's cart lumbers along. He looks back over his shoulder.

          CAIN
          (urgently, to Zed and Oh)
          They're gaining on us!
          Zed and Oh look back.

          THEIR POV
          The other oxcarts are a hundred yards back, "chasing" them at
          maybe two miles per hour.
          Cain whips his oxen and they step up the pace to 3 MPH.

          CAIN

          (GLEEFUL)
          Hah! They'll never catch us now!
          An aerial view shows Cain's cart slowly pulling away from his
          pursuers.
          Suddenly a bolt of lightning splits the bright blue sky and
          strikes Cain right on the forehead, knocking him back into
          the cart. He sits up stunned, with a still-smoking, jagged
          burn mark on his forehead.

          The ox cart approaches a small trading settlement on the
          seacoast, a kind of makeshift tent city around a central
          marketplace. Several dhows are tied up at the shore, camels
          and pack animals are tethered on the fringes, while TRADERS
          and MERCHANTS inspect newly arrived goods and haggle over
          prices.

          Zed, Oh and Cain wander through the crowded market. PEOPLE
          OF EVERY RACE dressed in all manner of exotic garb buy, sell,
          and barter goods from distant lands. Zed and oh gawk like a
          couple of yokels.

          They see a crowd at the center of the market gathered around
          a raised platform.
          SLAVES IN SHACKLES are lined up on the raised wooden platform
          while CUSTOMERS examine those waiting to be auctioned.
          The AUCTIONEER brings up a fnuscular male slave in a
          loincloth.

          It's Marlak!
          Marlak's hands are bound and he's restrained by a chain
          attached to a thick leather collar around his neck.

          AUCTIONEER
          (addresses the crowd)
          Next up, an unusual item-- looks
          like a Caucasian-- he's big, he's
          strong, he's a good breeder, so I'm
          going to start at                                               100        gold minas.

          As the bidding starts, Zed spots Maya, his sister Eema, and
          Enmebaragesi among the chained-up slaves waiting to be sold.
          Zed and Oh push their way through the crowd and go to them.

          ZED
          (amazed to see them)
          Eema! Maya!
          The women embrace him with relief and excitement.

          EEMA
          Oh.

          MAYA
          Well, after the fire--
          (she shoots him an
          accusing look))
          --the hill tribes raided the
          village. The men fought them but
          they were too many. They took us
          captive, marched us to the sea,
          then traded us to the boat people
          who brought us here.

          OH

          (SHRUGS)
          Just a little.
          Zed and Oh look at her curiously.
          The SLAVE TRADER sees them talking to Eema and approaches.

          SLAVE TRADER
          You interested in some slaves?

          ZED
          (like a prospective buyer)
          Yeah, this one looks pretty good--
          He starts prodding, poking and squeezing Maya's arm like he's
          buying fruit. Oh takes the opportunity to fondle Eema's
          breasts. She punches him.
          Zed                                                             (cont'd)
          Ooh, feisty! So how does this work
          if we want them?
          The slave trader notes Zed's peasant clothes.

          SLAVE TRADER
          You have money?

          ZED

          (CAGEY)
          Well, that depends on what you mean
          by money?

          SLAVE TRADER
          Look, pal, money talks and bullshit
          walks. I don't have time for looky-
          loos.

          Cain steps up and intercedes.

          CAIN

          (GRANDLY)
          Perhaps I can help.
          (confidentially to Zed and

          OH)
          Let me talk to the guy. Maybe I
          can make a deal with him. You guys
          wait here.
          Cain puts his arm around the slave trader's shoulder and
          walks him away.
          CAIN                                                        (cont'd)
          (to the slave trader)
          So what are we lookin' at here?
          From a distance, Zed and Oh watch them talking, but can't
          hear what they're saying.

          OH
          (to Eema)
          What an amazing coincidence--
          running into you and Maya and them.

          ZED
          You still think it's all just a
          coincidence?                                                All of us here right
          now, at this particular place, at
          this particular time?

          OH

          (THINKS)
          I don't know. Why do you think?

          ZED
          I'm not sure yet, but I'm starting
          to believe that everything happens
          for a reason. Like, why did I eat
          the forbidden fruit?

          OH
          To get laid?

          MAYA
          Hey!

          ZED

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                   44.
          Okay, that might have been what I
          was thinking at the time, but what
          if some omnipotent force put the
          fruit there because I was supposed
          to eat it?

          OH
          which omnipotent force?

          ZED
          What do you mean "which" omnipotent
          force? How many omnipotent forces
          could there be?

          OH
          I don't know! What's "omnipotent"
          mean?

          ZED
          Work with me-- I'm just speculating
          here. Let's call this force "God";
          and let's say this "God" is
          controlling everything. Maybe God
          wanted me to have the knowledge of
          good and evil.

          OH
          Why would he want that?

          MAYA
          How do you know God's a "He?"
          Zed rolls his eyes.

          ZED
          Don't you get what I'm saying?
          What if we've been chosen?

          MAYA
          You think we've been chosen by God?

          ZED
          Well, no offense, but it's possible
          that I was chosen and you all just
          happened to be there.

          OH
          Why would God choose you? Why
          wouldn't he choose Marlak? He's
          stronger.

          ZED
          A chosen doesn't need to be strong.
          I'm big this way.
          (points to his temples)

          OH
          You do have a fat face.

          ZED
          Not my face, my brain. It's
          enormous. I'm the smartest guy in
          the village.

          OH

          (SCOFFS)
          You're not even-- I'm smarter than
          you!

          ZED
          What?!
          (to ANOTHER VILLAGER)
          Which one of us is smarter?

          VILLAGER
          You're both idiots!

          ZED
          Oh yeah, then why are we free and
          you're chained up?

          VILLAGER
          Because of you?

          CAIN
          (calls them over)
          Hey! Come here. I think we worked
          something out.

          ZED
          (confidently, to Maya)
          Sit tight. I'm going to get you
          out of here. Do you trust me?

          MAYA

          (HEDGING)
          I want to trust you.

          ZED
          Fair enough.
          She gives him an encouraging hug, then Zed and Oh cross to
          Cain and the slave trader.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                      46.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)
          (to Cain)
          Good work. What's the deal?
          The slave owner smiles.

          CUT TO:

          26                                                             EXT. SLAVE MARKET - A LITTLE LATER   26

          Zed and Oh are dragged onto the platform in shackles and leg
          irons.
          They see Cain riding off on a donkey. He holds up a bag of
          coins and waves goodbye.

          ZED
          I never trusted that guy.

          OH

          (SARCASTIC                                                     )
          Why? Just 'cause he murdered his
          brother and got hit by lightning?
          They are pushed to the front of the platform.

          SLAVE TRADER
          (to the crowd)
          All right! Next up is a twofer--
          I'm selling them as a pair-- I know
          they don't look like much-- but I'm
          starting the bidding at sixty gold
          minas. Do I hear sixty?

          (NOTHING)
          Remember, it's two for one here.
          Do I hear fifty? Anyone? That's
          only twenty-five apiece, folks.

          (NOTHING)
          Zed looks out at the crowd, starting to get offended.
          SLAVE TRADER (cont'd)
          You're breaking my heart here. How
          about forty? Do I hear forty?

          (NOTHING)

          ZED
          (to Oh)
          It's not like I want to be a slave
          or anything, but this is
          embarrassing!

          

          

          

          
          Official white                                                                                 47.

          SLAVE TRADER
          Thirty-five? Thirty?

          ZED

          (SHOUTS)
          Come on, people! We're a steal at
          thirty!

          OH
          They probably don't know how smart
          you think you are.
          Finally, a Bedouin SHEIK raises his giraffe-tail fly whisk
          and waves it at the slave trader.

          SLAVE TRADER
          Yes! Sold to Sheikh Hassan for                                  30
          gold minas!
          (to Zed and Oh)
          Have a good time in the salt mines,
          boys.

          CUT TO:

          27                                                              EXT. DESERT - LATER THAT DAY   27

          A small CARAVAN OF CAMELS AND DONKEYS loaded with trade goods
          moves across the arid wasteland. The effete SHEIKH rides the
          lead camel, protected from the blistering sun by a colorful
          canopy. A FEW ARMED BEDOUIN GUARDS ride alongside.
          Bringing up the rear is A LARGE FOUR-WHEELED CART DRAWN BY
          HORSES, basically a cage on wheels into which TWENTY NEWLY
          PURCHASED SLAVES have been crammed, jammed together like
          sardines.
          Zed and Oh are in the middle of the body pile, literally
          cheek by jowl with the other slaves, barely able to move.       I
          Eema is right next to Oh, her body pressed tight against his.
          Oh shifts around, repositioning his arms and body trying to
          get more comfortable and give Eema a little space, but he
          just ends up touching her even more.

          OH

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Excuse me-- I'm sorry--
          (his hand gets stuck
          between her breasts)
          That's not good--
          He jerks his hand away, elbowing Marlak in the face.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             48.
          Marlak growls and grabs Oh by the throat, but the struggle
          forces everyone else to shift which causes even more
          discomfort.

          THE OTHER SLAVES
          Ow! Hey! Cut that out!
          Zed tries to turn his head to see who's behind him.

          ZED                                                             (CONT'D)

          (GROUCHY)
          Hey, pal! You can take your foot
          out of my ass anytime now.

          (BEAT)
          And your foot is still there. If I
          turn around, you will be sorry.
          Zed twists violently and manages a full turn which brings him
          face to face and crotch to crotch with Maya.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          That's better.

          MAYA
          For you maybe.

          ZED
          Look, I want you to know I blame
          myself for everything that
          happened.

          MAYA
          So does everybody else.

          MARLAK
          (over his shoulder)
          Get away from my woman!

          ZED

          (IRRITATED)
          I don't think that's going to be
          possible. And I told you before,
          she's not "your woman."

          MARLAK
          I'll kill you!
          Marlak starts muscling and squirming his way through the body
          pile trying to get to Zed.

          THE OTHER SLAVES
          Hey! Watch it, jerk!

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                                    49.
          It's too cramped to even throw a punch, so Marlak uses a
          RANDOM SLAVE'S HEAD as a weapon to bang against zed's head
          repeatedly.

          RANDOM SLAVE

          (MEEKLY)
          Why?
          Suddenly Zed feels Marlak's hands around his neck, grabbing
          him from behind. Zed struggles but Marlak manages to pull
          him into a full headlock, forcing Zed's face into his hairy
          armpit.

          ZED

          (MUFFLED)
          Ecchhh!
          Oh is vaguely aware of the fight going on but can't move.

          OH
          (calling to Zed)
          Hold on! I'm coming!
          Oh tries to maneuver to Zed, but can't move an inch.
          OH                                                            (CONT'D)                                            (cont'd)
          If everyone could just move to the
          right. Please? Thank you in
          advance for your cooperation.
          (then, giving up hope)
          You can do it, Zed! Use his weight
          against him!
                                                                        Marlak now has Zed locked in a lethal choke hold.

                                                                                                                            28

          A BEDOUIN GUARD notices the commotion and bangs the bars of
          the cage with his staff.

          BEDOUIN
          (shouts at the slaves)
          Knock it off! Don't make me come
          in there!

          ZED

          (MASHED)
          I'd like to see you try.
          The Bedouin is just about to respond when suddenly A METAL
          TIPPED ARROW FLIES IN AND PIERCES HIS THROAT. He drops to
          the sand, dead.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                    50.

          A BATTLE CHARIOT
          comes flying over the crest of the wadi followed by TWENTY
          ARMORED FOOT SOLDIERS wearing bronze helmets and
          breastplates.
          The soldiers attack the caravan, slashing and slicing the
          Bedouin guards.
          Their commander, SARGON, his helmet topped with a magnificent
          plume, rides up in the chariot and with one mighty stroke of
          his sword cuts the head off ANOTHER BEDOUIN GUARD.
          Marlak reaches through the bars, grabs the fallen Bedouin's
          sword and hacks off the lock on the door of the slave wagon.
          The door flies open and the slaves tumble, jump and stumble
          out onto the ground.
          Zed and Oh look around, gawking at the massacre taking place.
          Then Zed sees Marlak, sword in hand, looking for him.

          SARGON
          (shouts an order)
          Take the slaves!
          Marlak starts for Zed but two soldiers ride up and throw a
          heavy restraining net over him.
          Zed grabs oh and takes off running over the nearest sand
          dune.
          Sargon watches them flee.

          A SOLDIER
          Sir, shall I pursue them?

          SARGON
          No. Let the desert have them.
          They won't get far.

          The soldiers are camped for the night. The slaves are back
          in their cage. Sargon the commander stops to instruct the

          GUARD.

          distance.

          ZED

          (WHISPERS)
          I wonder who they are. Their hats
          are really great, aren't they?

          OH
          Their hats? I'm sorry, but when
          that one guy cut the other guy's
          head off, my first thought wasn't,
          "Gee, what a great hat."

          ZED
          It wasn't my very first thought,
          but I'd be lying if I said it
          wasn't up there.

          (WATCHFUL)
          Now we just need to figure out a
          way to rescue Maya and Eema.

          OH
          How are we going to rescue anybody?
          They're killers!

          ZED

          (WILY)
          Patience, my friend. Even killers
          have to sleep sometime.
          He keeps a sharp, wakeful eye on the enemy camp.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          31                                                           THE MORNING SUN   31
          Zed and Oh fast asleep on the ridge. They slowly wake up.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                              52.

          ZED

          (SCRATCHING)
          Well, that was refreshing. How'd
          you sleep?

          OH

          (YAWNS)
          Not that well. I think I was over-
          tired.
          Then Zed suddenly remembers Maya. He looks and sees that the
          soldiers and slaves are long gone.

          ZED
          Shit!
          He leaps to his feet, looks around desperately, and sees
          nothing but a vast wasteland in every direction.

          OH
          Now where do we go?
          Zed sniffs the air, puts his ear to the ground, and tastes
          the sand.

          ZED
          I have no idea.

          CUT TO:

          32                                                             ZED AND OH   32
          trudging across the desert in the blistering heat, growing
          weaker, stumbling and falling.

          OH
          (too weak to move)
          Why do I listen to you? Now we're
          going to starve to death or die of
          thirst.

          ZED
          Will you stop being so negative? I
          got your back, man. Who saved you
          from those lions when you were a
          baby? They were going to pounce,
          had you surrounded. Took the mama
          lion-- BAM!-- kneed her right in
          the face. Papa lion comes flying
          at me-- BAM!-- dropped an elbow,
          knocked his ass out.

          Took his legs-- THWOOM!-- tossed
          him in the river. And the rest
          just ran off.

          OH
          You know, I've asked people about
          that and no one else seems to
          remember it.

          ZED
          Yeah, because nobody else was
          there. You're lucky I was walking
          by.

          (THEN)
          Okay, it's possible I dreamed that--
          but who practically raised you
          after your father was dragged off
          by those raccoons? Not a dignified
          death.

          OH
          (practically delirious)
          He was a small man.
          Oh collapses face down in the sand.
          Pull back to reveal that they are surrounded by hungry
          jackals, vultures and hyenas.

          ZED
          We've got to keep moving.
          (hauls Oh to his feet)
          I've got you, buddy-- just like
          always.
          He puts Oh over his shoulder and stumbles on.

          33                                                              EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - LATER   33

          A MAN in his sixties, tall, full beard, piercing eyes and
          fierce nose, dressed in a robe and kafiyya, arranges firewood
          on a large flat rock. His TEENAGE SON looks around
          curiously. They are ABRAHAM and ISAAC.

          ISAAC
          Hey, Dad? We making a burnt
          offering?

          ABRAHAM
          Yes, Isaac. As God has commanded
          me.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             54.

          ISAAC

          (CONFUSED)
          I don't see the sheep.

          ABRAHAM
          The Lord will provide the sheep.
          Abraham takes a cord and starts tying Isaac's hands together.

          ISAAC

          (NERVOUSLY)
          Uh-- is this like a magic trick?
          Without another word Abraham takes strong hold of Isaac and
          lifts him up onto the firewood.
          ISAAC                                                           (cont'd)
          (really scared now)
          Okay, if this is because I didn't
          clean up my tent, you can stop now.
          I get it.
          Then Abraham pulls a long slaughtering knife from beneath his
          robe.
          ISAAC                                                           (cont'd)

          (PANICKED)
          All right, this isn't funny
          anymore!
          Abraham raises the knife.
          ISAAC                                                           (cont'd)
          I'm telling mom!
          The knife flashes in the sun as it descends toward the boy.

          ZED                                                             (O.C.)

          STOP!
          Abraham and Isaac both turn to see Zed and Oh step out from
          behind the rocks. Their clothes are tattered and they are
          burnt raw by the sun.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          What are you doing to that kid?

          ABRAHAM

          (INNOCENTLY)
          Nothing.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                  55.

          ZED
          What do you mean, nothing? You
          were just going to kill him!

          ABRAHAM
          No, I was going to sacrifice him.
          There's a difference.

          ZED
          (indicating Isaac)
          Not to him, I'm guessing.
          Isaac nods gratefully.

          ABRAHAM
          By what right do you interfere?
          Art thou an angel of the Lord?

          ZED
          (good question)
          What do you think?

          ABRAHAM
          (nods sagely)
          Verily, thou wast sent to stay my
          hand by the Eternal one, blessed be
          He.

          ZED

          (NODS)
          Whatever you just said.
          Oh helps Isaac off the altar stone and unties him.

          ISAAC
          (confidentially to Oh)
          He's nuts! I'm telling you-- he's
          totally lost it.

          ABRAHAM
          (to Zed)
          I am Abraham, son of Terah of the
          house of Nahor.

          ZED
          I am Zed and this is Oh, sons of--
          people you wouldn't know.

          ABRAHAM
          The tents of my kinsmen lie just
          beyond. There will you find all
          that you desire. Come.

          CUT TO:

          Abraham leads Isaac, Zed and Oh past the colorful               tents of
          his people. The camp is alive with activity.

          35                                                              INT. ABRAHAM'S TENT - NIGHT   35

          The spacious tent is lit by torches, and a feast is in
          progress. TWENTY OR THIRTY BEARDED MEN in skullcaps and long
          robes lounge on cushions or sit cross-legged in a circle on
          the carpeted floor.
          An EGYPTIAN BELLY DANCER shakes her hips for the pleasure of
          Abraham who occupies the place of honor.
          Zed and oh, now also wearing robes and skullcaps, are sitting
          right beside him eating and drinking everything in sight.
          Isaac sits beside them.
          ABRAHAM claps his hands for attention. Zed and Oh look up as
          the music stops.

          ABRAHAM
          (to the assembly)
          My brothers, let us give thanks
          unto God for staying my hand on the
          mountain this day.

          ISAAC
          (humoring him)
          Best dad in all the land, everyone!

          THE KINSMEN
          (a ritual response, in

          UNISON)
          Praise be to God, hallowed be His
          name.

          ABRAHAM
          And for the bounty which He hath
          bestowed unto us.

          (in unison)
          He hath increased our wealth and
          blessed us with His loving
          kindness.
          Zed and Oh mutter along, trying to fit in.

          ZED AND OH
          (a beat late)
          --mumble mumble mumble loving
          kindness.
          Abraham looks at them.

          ABRAHAM
          Friends, whence comest thou?
          Zed and Oh look at each other blankly.

          ISAAC

          (HELPFULLY)
          He wants to know where you're from.

          ABRAHAM

          (SUSPICIOUS)
          Thou comest not from the cities of
          the plain? From Sodom or Gomorrah?
          Zed perks up at the mention of Sodom, recalling the
          destination of the soldiers who took Maya and the others.

          ZED
          Sodom and Gomorrah? Never been
          there. But I've heard of them.

          OH
          Are they nice?

          ABRAHAM
          The Lord has cursed them for their
          abomination.

          ZED
          (nods gravely)
          i didn't know that. What kind of
          abomination are we talking about?

          ABRAHAM
          They bow down before false Gods and
          worship graven images.

          ZED
          (clicks his tongue)
          Abominable.

          ABRAHAM
          The men of the city are weak and
          soft, fat with rich food,
          intoxicated by strong drink.

          ZED
          (sounds good to him)
          Really. Tell me more.

          ABRAHAM
          Their women are whores; their
          shameless lust knows no bounds.
          They flaunt their flesh without
          shame and any man may have
          knowledge of them.

          OH
          (he's sold)
          And where exactly are those cities?

          ZED
          (off Abraham's stern look)
          We just want to know so we can
          avoid them.

          ABRAHAM

          (FIERCELY)
          Walk not the path of Sodom! For
          surely will the Lord send his holy
          fire to destroy the city and all
          who dwell within, to smite them and
          all their seed for their iniquity.

          ZED

          (CONCERNED)
          When do you think all this smiting
          is going to go down? We may have
          some friends there.

          ABRAHAM
          (getting up)
          Accompany me.
          Abraham sweeps out of the tent. Zed and Oh jump to their
          feet and follow. Isaac tags along.

          Abraham walks to the edge of the desert. Torchlight from the
          camp flickers on his face as he gazes across the desolate
          moonlit landscape.

          ZED
          Abraham, I'm a little worried about
          the city being destroyed.

          ABRAHAM
          Their fate is sealed. But for my
          faith and devotion, the self-same
          God has given unto me the whole of
          this land, from the Jordan to the
          Negev, from the river of Egypt to
          the great Euphrates. This did He
          grant to me and my seed.
          He raises his arms and spreads them wide.

          ZED

          (IMPRESSED)
          This is all your land?

          ABRAHAM
          For eternity.

          ISAAC

          (SCOFFS)
          Yeah, God just forgot to tell
          anyone else. we're having a war
          with someone like every five
          minutes.

          ABRAHAM
          (scowls at him)
          I and my kinsmen have vanquished
          our enemies by the mighty hand of
          the Lord, praised be He.
          Zed and Oh fake their way through a ritual response.

          ZED
          His name is praise and love his
          whole graciousness--

          OH
          --of his wealthy bounty.
          Abraham gets a strange faraway look in his eyes.

          Therefore, to signify my Covenant
          with the One True God, on this
          night will I circumcise the flesh
          of my foreskin, and of you and
          every male who dwells hereby.

          Here we go again--

          ABRAHAM
          we will grasp the foreskins of our
          penises and cut therefrom the extra
          flesh.

          ZED

          pierced?

          ISAAC
          (aside to Zed)
          Okay, what did I tell you-- nuts?

          ZED
          You know, Abe, it's late, and we've
          all had a lot to drink, and I know
          this whole foreskin thing sounds
          like a good idea now, but you may
          just want to sleep on it. we could
          always cut 'em off in the morning,
          but if we do it now, there's just
          no putting it back on later.

          ABRAHAM
          No. So it shall be written, so it
          shall be done.
          (to Isaac)
          Get my big knife.
          Zed and Oh both reflexively cover their crotches.

          Zed and oh stumble over the rocky hills. They hear a PAINED
          SCREAM from someone being circumcised back at Abraham's camp.

          OH
          You have any idea where we're
          going?

          ZED
          To the city. I have to find Maya.

          OH
          The city! He said God's going to
          smite them with holy fire!

          ZED
          And you're going to listen to him?
          You think he's more chosen than me?

          OH
          He seemed to know what he was
          talking about.

          ZED
          Yes, and he also wanted to give his
          dick a little trim.

          VOICE                                                           (O.C.)
          Hey, wait up!
          Zed and Oh turn to see Isaac running towards them.

          ISAAC
          (out of breath)
          I'm coming with you.

          ZED
          You don't even know where we're
          going.

          ISAAC
          You're going to Sodom, right?

          ZED
          No. Your dad specifically said
          Sodom and Gomorrah were evil.

          ISAAC
          Yeah, whatever. If I show you how
          to get there, will you buy me a
          bottle of wine?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                     62.

          ZED
          No! I told you, that's not where
          we're going.

          ISAAC
          Fine. Then we'll just stand here.

          ZED
          Fine.
          They stand there for less than a beat.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Okay, you win. Take us to Sodom.
          Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points
          off in the distance.

          THEIR POV
          Shining in the moonlight, the magnificent city of Sodom set
          atop a broad hill surrounded by high walls.

          ZED
          I knew it was right around here.

          ISAAC
          Me and my friends sneak in on the
          weekends. We hang around, pick up
          on the babes, drink some wine, get
          wasted on killer hash--

          ZED
          You shouldn't be smoking either.

          ISAAC
          Thanks, Grandpa, but I've been
          smoking for four harvests, so I
          think I'm okay.
                                                                          They start down toward the city.

                                                                                                             CUT TO:

          Zed, Oh and Isaac gape at the high masonry walls as they
          approach the massive solid wooden gates.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             63.

          OH
          Gee, they're not open. We should
          probably come back later.

          ISAAC
          You just have to knock. They
          always let me in.
          (to Oh)
          Go ahead.

          OH
          Me? Why do I have to knock? What
          if we're waking somebody up? Let's
          just get out of here.

          ZED
          Where? Back to the penis-cutter?
          Besides, Eema and Maya might be in
          there. You want to get them out
          before the city's destroyed, don't
          you?
          Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the
          door.

          ISAAC

          (SHOUTING)
          Hey! Anybody there? Hello?
          Suddenly Zed and Oh are yanked off their feet from behind and
          slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries. Isaac quickly
          runs away.

          SENTRY
          (shouts at him)
          Halt!
          Isaac stops a safe distance away and turns back to taunt the
          guards.

          ISAAC
          You gonna make me?
          (dancing and dodging like
          a boxer)
          You and what army?

          ZED
          (shouts to Isaac)
          Get help! Tell your father!

          ISAAC
          (shouts back)
          Yeah!

          Like I'm really gonna tell my
          father I came with you to Sodom.
          So long, suckers!
          He takes off running.

          ZED
          (to Oh)
          I kinda get why his dad wanted to
          kill him.
          The sentries drag them through a small door cut into a corner
          of the city gates.

          CUT TO:

          39                                                              INT. GATEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS   39

          The sentries shove them into a small guard post and throw
          them up against the wall. THREE OTHER GUARDS look up at the
          new arrivals.

          FIRST GUARD
          What's this now?

          SENTRY
          They were banging on the gate.
          Hebrews, from the look of them.

          ZED
          We're not really Hebrews--
          The guard smacks him in the mouth.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Okay. Lesson learned. No talking.

          SENTRY
          Should we wake the Sergeant?

          FIRST GUARD
          You don't want to do that. He gets
          pretty mean when you wake him.

          OH
          Meaner than this?
          The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly.
          The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look
          nervously to a closed door at one end of the room.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             65.

          SERGEANT
          (from behind the door,

          ROARS)

          BLOODY HELL! WHAT'S GOING ON OUT

          THERE!
          Zed and Oh exchange worried looks. Then the door flies open
          and the SERGEANT, a huge, angry, sadistic rhino of a man,
          fills the door frame.
          SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd)
          Who the hell screamed?
          They all point at Oh.
          SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd)
          (glowers at him)
          I thought it was a woman.
          He lumbers over and gets his face very close to Oh's.
          SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd)
          You don't look like a woman, but
          maybe you want to kiss me anyway.
          Is that right? You want to kiss
          me?
          Oh turns away from his foul breath.
          The sergeant grabs Oh by the throat and practically lifts him
          off the ground.
          SERGEANT                                                        (cont'd)
          By morning you'll be sorry you were
          born.

          OH
          Don't have to wait 'til morning.

          ZED
          Hey! Why don't you pick on someone
          your own size?
          The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (quickly backpedaling)
          Which would be difficult since
          there are probably very few people
          around who actually are your size--
          He smacks Zed hard on the side of the head.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                   66.

          SERGEANT
          (to another guard)
          Get my big stick. I'll deal with
          the fat one first.

          ZED

          (INSULTED)
          Relatively fat one. I wouldn't be
          talking about fat, if I were you.
          Another blow from the sergeant.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)
          Right. Enough said.
          The sergeant rips open Zed's shirt exposing his back, then
          steps up behind Oh and does the same. A guard hands him a
          lethal-looking bat studded with sharp spikes.

          SERGEANT
          (to Zed and Oh)
          Welcome to Sodom.
          As he takes a big backswing, Zed and Oh shut their eyes and
          prepare for the worst.

          VOICE                                                         (O.C.)
          Stop!
          Zed and Oh turn to see Cain at the door, dressed like the
          other guards in breastplate and helmet.

          CAIN
          Wait! I know these guys!

          ZED AND OH
          Cain?

          CAIN
          Brothers!!
          He embraces them. They look confused and doubtful, but
          relieved.

          CUT TO:

          40                                                            EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT - LATER   40

          Cain leads them through the narrow crowded streets. People
          avoid Cain's gaze and part like the Red Sea to allow him
          through.

          CAIN
          You know, you guys are lucky that
          sergeant is a friend of mine. I
          let him sodomize me once right
          after I got here and he's been real
          nice to me ever since.

          OH

          (SARCASTIC)
          Yeah, thanks for saving us. What
          are you going to do to us now?
          Cain stops and looks at them.

          CAIN
          wait a second. Do I detect a tone
          here?

          ZED
          All right, honestly? You did sell
          us into slavery.

          CAIN
          (instantly offended)
          Whoa whoa whoa! Hold a grudge
          much? That was like a fortnight
          ago.

          ZED
          That was way less than a fortnight.
          Half a fortnight, maybe.

          CAIN
          Give me a break! I was dealing
          with the death of a close family
          member and I needed some space.
          But now I realize that you guys are
          like my brothers. And it's so rare
          to find a brother that you love.
          Right?
          He embraces them.

          ZED AND OH

          (UNEASILY)
          Right.

          CAIN

          (EXUBERANT)
          Now, you guys hungry? Watch this.
          Cain walks up to a food vendor's stall and stares menacingly
          at the VENDOR. He raises his fist. The vendor cowers.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             68.

          (to Vendor)
          That's two for flinching.
          Cain grabs two lamb kebabs and hands them to Zed and Oh.
          CAIN                                                            (cont'd)
          That's the kind of love I'm talkin'
          about.
          As they eat hungrily, Zed makes eye contact with a prostitute
          lounging in a doorway.

          ZED
          Check out that woman across the
          street! She's looking at us.
          The prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a
          banana, then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth.

          OH
          We are so in! She's eye-knowing us
          like crazy.

          CAIN
          You're gonna love Sodom. Trust me.
          It's crazy. This morning, I almost
          got a handie behind that pita
          stand.

          OH
          Well, I kind of have a girlfriend--
          not a girlfriend, yet, but a girl I
          like, so I shouldn't--

          CAIN
          Hey, what happens in Sodom, stays
          in Sodom.
          He takes a jug of wine from the stall of a WINE MERCHANT.
          The merchant just bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut.
          CAIN                                                            (cont'd)
          You know, if you guys are staying
          you should join the guards. The
          pay's not great, but there's tons
          of perks. I'm telling you, it's
          the only way to go.
          Cain grabs a piece of candy from a SMALL CHILD and stuffs it
          in his mouth. The child starts crying, Cain kicks her in the
          ass and she runs away.

          OH
          (to the child)
          Sorry.

          A military drum roll and the blare of trumpets rouse the
          garrison. GUARDSMEN come double-timing out of the barracks
          and hurry to line up in formation.
          Last to emerge are Zed and Oh who step leisurely out the door
          now dressed as Royal Guards. Zed actually looks dashing, but
          Oh's breastplate is too big and his helmet keeps slipping
          down over his eyes.

          ZED
          This is great! How do I look?

          OH
          You look good, but I think my hat's
          too big.
          They notice an OFFICER staring at them.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)
          (to the officer)
          Do you happen to know where I could
          get a smaller hat?
          The officer pops him on the head with a truncheon.

          OFFICER

          (ROARS)
          Line up!
          Zed and Oh hustle into line, orders are shouted and the troop
          marches off.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          42                                                              EXT. CITY STREETS   - LATER          42

          Zed and Oh are on patrol with Cain in the heart of the city.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                            70.

          ZED
          So is this it? We just walk
          around?

          CAIN
          Pretty much. We just look for
          troublemakers and kick the living
          shit out of 'em.

          ZED
          What kind of trouble?

          CAIN
          If we see a thief or a pickpocket,
          we just slap him around-- maybe cut
          off a finger or an ear, or the tip
          of his nose, lower lip-- anything
          you can just grab and slice in one
          fluid motion-- then we take our
          share of the loot and let him go.
          Mostly what we worry about are
          activist types, rabble rousers,
          getting people all riled up against
          the King or the Temple Priests.
          That's death for sure.

          ZED
          Pretty harsh, isn't it?

          CAIN
          Harsh times, brother. We're in the
          middle of a famine. People are
          starving. If we don't get some
          rain soon, it could get ugly.
          (looking forward to it)
          Then we'll get to start kicking ass
          big time.
          He stops to flog a BEGGAR with his hand out.
          CAIN                                           (cont'd)
          Beat it, you filthy beggar!

          OH
          You can't blame people for being
          hungry.

          CAIN
          Yeah, well, just remember, it's the
          palace that pays you, not the
          people.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             71.
          Suddenly, they hear a regal fanfare of approaching trumpets
          and turn to look.
          At the sound of the trumpets EVERYONE IN THE CROWDED SQUARE
          falls to the ground and prostrates himself. Cain pulls Oh to
          the ground but Zed is left standing there oblivious as the
          ROYAL ENTOURAGE approaches.
          Oh taps on Zed's leg trying to get his attention, but Zed
          just ignores it, too transfixed to notice that he's the only
          one standing.
          EIGHT STRONG MALE SLAVES enter the square carrying an
          ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy. On it
          is the PRINCESS INANNA, a stunning young woman, richly
          dressed and bejeweled, with exotic eyes and luscious red
          lips. A HANDMAIDEN rides along fanning her with a big
          ostrich plume fan.
          Zed sees the Princess and is instantly taken with her beauty.
          Princess Inanna glances his way and can't help but notice
          he's the only person in the square still standing. She gives
          him a quizzical smile, then turns away imperiously.
          As the litter passes, her handmaiden continues to stare at
          Zed. He doesn't recognize her, but we do. It's Maya, now
          elaborately costumed and made-up.
          Zed gawks at the Princess, then suddenly a ROYAL GUARD knocks
          him to the ground and stands on his neck as the rest of the
          entourage passes.

          ZED
          (on the ground, excitedly
          to Oh)
          Did you see that girl? I think she
          liked me! She looked right at me.

          OH
          Gee, I wonder why?
          The royal guard takes his foot off Zed's neck and they all
          get back to their feet.

          ZED
          Who was she?

          CAIN
          The Princess Inanna. She's totally
          hot, but don't even think about it.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                       72.

          ZED
          Why not?

          CAIN
          Because she's royalty and you're
          scum?
          The entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the
          royal entourage.

          OH
          Where's everybody going?

          CAIN
          To the temple. Let's go.
          (starts walking)
          You have to see this.

          ZED

          (FOLLOWING)
          Will she be there?

          CAIN
          Everybody will be there.

          At the center of the square is a magnificent temple adorned
          with elaborate carvings and monumental statues of pagan gods.
          Before it is a great altar in front of a HUGE STONE IDOL.
          The idol's mouth is a gaping fiery furnace. Behind the
          temple, is a towering ZIGGURAT still under construction.
          A HUNDRED TRUMPETERS AND DRUMMERS blast a solemn fanfare as
          ORNATELY GARBED PRIESTS ceremoniously climb the stairs to the
          altar.

          ZED AND OH
          stare at the spectacle.

          44                                                              THE ROYAL PAVILION                   44
          The Princess Inanna takes her seat near the KING, the QUEEN,
          the MINISTERS and other NOBLES. Maya stands behind the
          Princess and continues fanning her.
          Zed spots the Princess on the pavilion.

          ZED
          Hey, there she is!
          He starts edging toward the royal pavilion.

          45                                                            THE PAVILION
          Under a broad awning, the King and Queen snack from a table
          covered with platters of exotic fruits and sweetmeats.
          The King, an imposing man with Shakespearean gravity, wipes
          his mouth and glances at the Princess Inanna.

          KING
          The Princess isn't eating?

          INANNA
          I find it hard to eat when so many
          are hungry.

          KING
          (as if )
          Your concern is enviable.

          INANNA

          (POUTY)
          And besides, I'm so fat.
          The Queen,                                                    40's, still beautiful, reacts.

          QUEEN
          (for the hundredth time)
          You're not fat--

          INANNA
          Yes, I am, mother! Those new linen
          pants you got me from Egypt make my
          ass look just huge.

          QUEEN
          Well, you can't keep starving
          yourself.

          INANNA
          Why not? Everybody else is
          starving-- present company
          excluded.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                    74.

          KING
          Careful, Princess. You may be my
          step-daughter, but these are
          dangerous times and those are
          dangerous words. I weep for the
          suffering of my people, but the
          spirit of rebellion is alive in the
          city and if necessary I will crush
          it with every means at my disposal.

          INANNA

          (SARCASTIC)
          For the good of the people.

          KING
          (warning her)
          For the good of everyone who enjoys
          the favor of the throne.

          INANNA
          Whatever. I'm just so incredibly
          bored.

          46                                                             THE TEMPLE DOORS   46
          The fanfare climaxes as the great temple doors slowly open
          and the HIGH PRIEST emerges followed by a retinue of
          PRIESTESSES and a dozen VESTAL VIRGINS. They walk in solemn
          silence to ritual positions around the altar.
          The High Priest is even more elaborately costumed than the
          nobles, ridiculously so, standing very tall on high platform
          shoes, with heavy eye makeup, his hair and beard even oilier
          than the others. He turns to the altar, raises his hands to
          the heavens and begins his invocation.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (intoning pompously)
          O El, lord of Heaven and Earth;
          Baal, the Sublime; Shapash, goddess
          of the sun; Hadad, the storm god,
          over-ruling son of Dagon, the
          bountiful, god of grain, our
          earthly sustenance--

          ZED
          He makes his way to a position just below the royal pavilion
          and stares up at the Princess Inanna.
          She sees him looking at her but pretends not to notice.

          

          

          

          
          Official white                                                           75.

          INANNA
          Isn't that the idiot who was
          standing up in the street?
          Maya sees him, too, and starts fuming.
          The High Priest continues.

          HIGH PRIEST
          We come before you in humble
          supplication, invoking your
          blessing, the sweet rain which
          waters our fields, enriches the
          harvest, fills our storehouses,
          makes mighty the house of Ish-ka-bi-
          baal and the city of Sodom--
          The King nods graciously.
          HIGH PRIEST                                                   (cont'd)
          --and feeds us, your children, with
          the bounty of your grace.

          PRINCESS INANNA
          She glances at Zed again, but this time a slight smile
          crosses her lips.
          Zed grins back at her.
          The Princess whispers something to her handmaiden Maya and
          subtly points Zed out to her. Maya nods obediently, glaring
          at Zed, and starts fanning the princess a little too
          vigorously.

          THE ALTAR

          HIGH PRIEST
          Accept now this humble sacrifice to
          the power and glory of your
          magnificence.
          He starts inspecting the Vestal Virgins, beautiful young
          women in diaphanous, almost transparent white gowns.

          ZED AND OH
          have no idea what's going on. Zed turns to the GUY NEXT TO

          HIM.

          ZED
          What's happening?

          GUY
          He's picking a virgin.

          CAIN

          (LASCIVIOUS)
          Oh yeah. Uh huh. Uh huh.

          AT THE ALTAR
          the High Priest is moving down the line of beautiful young
          maidens. He comes to one SLUTTY GIRL who seems so obviously
          not a virgin, he does a double take and kicks her out of the
          line.

          ZED AND OH
          watching curiously.

          ZED
          What do they want a virgin for?

          GUY
          To throw into the fire.

          ZED

          (SHOCKED)
          Why?

          GUY
          (like talking to an idiot)
          Offering to the Gods. There's a
          famine going on. If we don't make
          a good sacrifice, it won't rain.
          No rain, no harvest. No harvest,
          no food. Get it?

          CAIN
          It's pretty self-explanatory.

          OH
          You throw the virgin in the fire so
          it'll rain?

          GUY
          Duh.

          ZED
          Seems like a waste of a perfectly
          good virgin to me.

          OH

          (CONCERNED)
          These virgins-- it's always a girl,
          right?

          AT THE ALTAR
          A great cheer goes up as a girl is chosen. She swoons as the
          priestesses slip off her vestment and two priests escort her
          to the fiery mouth of the furnace.

          HIGH PRIEST
          For the love of the Gods and the
          glory of their Creation, the great
          dome of Heaven, the green growing
          Earth, we commit this maiden to
          your Holy Fire.
          Another great cheer from the crowd as they throw her into the
          fire.

          ZED

          (APPALLED)
          This is just crazy.
          Maya approaches them but Zed and Oh still don't recognize
          her.

          MAYA
          (eyes downcast)
          The Princess wishes to see you.

          CAIN
          (staring at her cleavage)
          Her wish is my command.

          MAYA
          Not you. Him.
          (points at Zed)

          ZED
          Me? Cool.
          (then, motioning to Oh)
          We're kind of a package deal. Can
          he come with?

          CAIN
          The three of us are inseparable.
          We're like brothers.
          Cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives Maya an
          artificial smile.

          Maya ignores Cain and points to Zed and Oh.

          MAYA
          The two of you follow me.

          ZED
          (to Cain)
          I'll try to put in a good word for
          you.

          A SQUAD OF SENTRIES stands guard at the massive iron palace
          gates. A CROWD OF BEGGARS is pressed against the gate
          pleading for food. Zed and Oh approach led by Maya. The
          guards brutally push the beggars aside and they enter.

          MAYA
          (to Oh)
          This is Zaftig the Eunuch. You go
          with him.
          Oh is led away by the Eunuch as she takes Zed off in the
          opposite direction.

          OH
          Can't I go with him?

          EUNUCH
          Why? Is he your lover?

          OH
          (laughs at the thought)
          Hah! No? That would be weird.

          LOVERS--
          The Eunuch just shrugs, apparently not that weird to him.
          OH                                                            (cont'd)

          (COVERING)
          So what do you do?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                                    79.

          EUNUCH
          I serve the royal family-- little
          of this, little of that. I've been
          a palace eunuch since I was nine
          years old.

          OH
          You've been living here since you
          were nine?
          (looks around, impressed)
          I should look into that. How do
          you get to be a eunuch?

          EUNUCH

          (MATTER-OF-FACT)
          They cut off your testicles.

          OH

          (HORRIFIED)
          What?! What's up with all the
          genital mutilation?

          EUNUCH

          (SHRUGS)
          Trust me, after a while you don't
          even miss them.

          OH

          (EMPHATIC)
          No, I'd miss them-- I'm sure. I
          hardly got to use them yet.
          The Eunuch leads him down the corridor.

          INT. PALACE THRONE ROOM - SAME TIME

          The High Priest, an extremely vain, officious, and fussy man,
          still over-dressed in sacramental drag, pushes back his
          sleeves and starts examining the entrails as the King and his
          MINISTERS look on, deeply concerned.

          KING
          Six sacrifices in the last ten days
          and still no rain. What do the
          entrails predict?

          HIGH PRIEST
          (nervously poking at the
          sheep heart)
          Well, the liver is streaked with
          gray-- that's not a favorable sign--
          but the heart looks good. See how
          nice and red it is here. That's
          always a good omen.

          KING
          What does it mean?

          HIGH PRIEST
          Usually it means that the sheep
          took very good care of itself,
          probably sticking to a high-fiber
          diet of grass and hay.

          KING
          What does it mean for us?

          HIGH PRIEST
          Well, it could mean either a
          surprise visit from a former friend
          or sweetheart-- or that you're
          going on a long sea voyage!
          Wouldn't that be fun?

          KING

          (SCORNFUL)
          How did you become High Priest?

          HIGH PRIEST
          Because I'm your brother?

          PRIME MINISTER
          Perhaps it's time for a new High
          Priest.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (his eyes go wide)
          Perhaps it's not time for a new
          High Priest. Aaaahh!
          He dramatically flings his fingers out at the Prime Minister,
          as if wielding the power of the Gods.
          Nothing happens.
          HIGH PRIEST                                                     (cont'd)
          And let that be a warning to you.

          PRIME MINISTER
          (ignores him)
          Majesty, there's talk of revolution
          in the streets. Grain and oil are
          scarce, prices are high, starving
          peasants are pouring into the city
          looking for food--

          KING
          Poverty has a bitter taste, but
          it's the flavor they were born to.
          It's the will of the Gods.
          The Queen and Princess Inanna are lounging on cushioned
          divans, listening.

          INANNA

          (BLASE)
          Can the Gods really be so cruel?

          QUEEN
          I don't think that's cruel. It's
          just practical. If everybody was
          rich, who'd wait on us?
          Maya approaches and whispers something to the Princess.

          INANNA
          Good. See that he's bathed and
          dressed, then bring him to me.
          Maya frowns and exits.
          INANNA (cont'd)
          (to the queen)
          This should be amusing.

          Maya leads Zed down a grand hallway. Zed is now wearing a
          long flowing robe of silk brocade, fine sandals, and jewelry.
          His hair has been combed and pulled back into a loose
          ponytail. He stops to admire himself in a mirror.

          ZED
          What do you think, ponytail or no
          ponytail? You know what?

          I'll start with the ponytail, see
          where the night takes me.
          Maya rolls her eyes and leads Zed to the entrance of the
          Great Hall. Cain and another guard are posted at the door.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)

          inside?

          CAIN

          (POINTED)
          I wouldn't know.- I'm just a guard
          because my "brother" didn't pull
          any strings with his friends in the
          royal court.

          ZED
          Look, first of all, we're not
          actually brothers---

          CAIN
          Just like Abel. I oughta just bash
          your head in--

          ZED
          Hey! You didn't let me finish. As
          soon as I get in there I'm going to
          talk to somebody and get you
          invited, okay?

          CAIN

          (UNCONVINCED)
          Yeah, sure. Have a nice orgy.
          Cain pulls open the big doors and Zed steps through the
          portal. Cain tries to steal peeks inside as the heavy doors
          slam shut.

          A full-scale ORGY is going on in a magnificent hall.
          As Maya leads him into the room, Zed pulls his hair out of
          the ponytail.

          ZED
          Feels like a hair-down kinda scene,

          Be sure to try the fruit.
          Zed looks at her and finally recognizes her.

          ZED
          Maya?! What are you doing here?

          MAYA
          I had no choice. I'm a slave,
          remember?

          ZED
          I was going to rescue you! Really!
          In fact, we came here to find you.

          MAYA
          (not buying it)
          Wait here until you're sent for.

          ZED
          This wasn't my idea, you know.

          MAYA
          Of course not. You were just
          chosen again. Maybe after you and
          the Princess get together you can
          start thinking about someone beside
          yourself.
          She walks off before he can answer.
          Zed shakes his head, looks around the room, then STARTS
          walking past a row of "LIVING STATUES," semi-nude men and
          women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint,
          frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful
          bodies.
          Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude "GODDESS", then
          furtively reaches out and fondles her breast. The goddess
          slaps his hand, then resumes her pose.

          GODDESS
          watch it, jerk!

          ZED
          Hey! You're a real girl! That is
          so cool.

          He moves down the row of living sculptures, mugging at them,
          mock humping, and waving his hands in their faces trying to
          make them move, but they remain frozen.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Amazing!
          He comes to the LAST STATUE and does a double-take. This one
          is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like
          someone waiting for a bus. He is also painted gold, but
          unlike the others, he has a little potbelly and round
          shoulders, and can't seem to hold still for very long,
          shifting his weight uncomfortably and looking around in
          obvious embarrassment.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (recognizing him)
          Oh?
          Oh looks down from his pedestal.

          OH
          (through clenched teeth)
          I'm not supposed to talk. I'm a
          statue.

          ZED
          Yeah, you look so-- gold. How's it
          going?

          OH
          How's it going? I just had my
          whole body painted by a fat guy
          with no balls, and believe me, he
          was very thorough, if you know what
          I mean. How's it going with you?

          ZED
          Not bad. Had a little rub and a
          scrub, now I'm up for some grub.

          OH
          That sounds nice-- for you.

          ZED
          Hey! You'll never guess who's here-
          - Maya! She's working here-- and
          she looks great! But she's kinda
          mad at me.
          Oh scans the great hall looking for her and spots Zed's
          sister Eema, his crush, come into the room carrying a tray of
          food.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                           85.

          OH
          There's Eema!
          Eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a
          household slave. She stops to serve some rowdy OFFICERS who
          take the opportunity to tease and fondle her. She tries to
          pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm.

          SARGON
          Stand still, wench! I want to see
          what's under that skirt.
          As he starts to lift her hem, she drops the whole tray of
          food on him. His cohorts laugh.

          EEMA
          I'm sorry! It was an accident.

          SARGON
          That was no accident!
          Sargon grabs her and raises his hand to hit her.
          Zed steps in quickly.

          ZED
          You! Slave girl!
          (he pulls her away from

          SARGON)
          I told you to fetch me more wine!
          Apologize to this officer--- now!

          EEMA
          I'm sorry.

          ZED
          Now go-- fetch! Wait by that--
          skinny statue. I'll deal with you
          later.
          As Eema exits, Zed turns to the officers and shrugs.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)
          Slaves-- what are you gonna do?

          SARGON
          Try using a hot poker. That they
          understand.

          ZED
          Ouch. Helpful hint. I will keep
          that in mind.

          Zed bows, then leaves him and joins Eema who is waiting at
          Oh's pedestal.
          Zed                                                          (cont'd)
          What are you doing here?

          EEMA
          We were sold to the palace. But I
          won't serve these people! I'd
          rather die!

          ZED
          Keep that up and you will.

          EEMA
          What are you doing here?
          (notices his clothes)
          Have you joined them?

          OH
          I haven't joined anything.
          (re the gold body paint)
          Does this look like fun?
          They both look accusingly at Zed.

          ZED
          Okay, I know what you're thinking,
          but I'm just checking it out. We
          kept hearing that this place was so
          evil, but now that I look around
          I'm thinking maybe it's not all
          bad. There's a lot to learn here.

          OH
          What? Like human sacrifice?

          ZED
          No! Like the wheel, for instance!
          That's pretty awesome-- the way it
          just goes around in a circle. And
          farming! And metal-- writing,
          money, pottery-- hot baths. Come
          on! Back in the village we thought
          sharpening a stick was a big
          breakthrough.

          EEMA
          (to Oh)
          What happened to him?

          Look, I think I've been chosen to
          do something great with my life--

          OH
          Here we go again--

          ZED
          --and I don't think it's hunting
          wild pigs and weaving baskets.
          Maya returns for Zed.

          MAYA

          (COOLLY)
          She wants to see you-- now.

          ZED
          I hope you don't think I'm
          interested in her.

          MAYA

          (MIFFED)
          Why would I think that? Just

          ZED
          I'm just using her, Maya! It's
          part of my plan. I'm going to get
          you all out of here as soon as I
          can.

          MAYA

          (SKEPTICAL)
          What's your plan?

          ZED
          (not a clue)
          It's a secret.

          MAYA
          (not buying it)
          Forget it.
          Maya sees A GUARD watching them and reverts to her slave
          attitude.

          The Princess awaits you.

          ZED
          And I await her.
          (to Oh and Eema)
          You two await me.
          (then confidentially to
          Eema and Oh)
          Stay out of trouble. I'll be back.
          He exits with Maya.

          EEMA
          He has no idea what he's doing,
          does he?

          OH
          I don't know. So much has
          happened. Sometimes I think--
          She walks away.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)

          I love you.

          Lounging on a divan surrounded by YOUNG MEN. Oh walks by
          still painted gold.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (to Oh)
          You there! Golden boy! Rub me
          with oil.
          The High Priest dismisses the young men, then stands and lets
          his rich outer robe fall to the floor. His chest, back and
          shoulders are incredibly hairy.

          OH
          I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
          I'm not really a slave. I'm a
          guard.

          HIGH PRIEST
          Then maybe you'd rather I speak to
          your commander and have you whipped
          to within an inch of your life. Or
          perhaps I whip you myself? How
          would you like that?

          OH
          Are those my choices?

          HIGH PRIEST
          I'd say so.
          The High Priest lies back down. Oh looks around, finds a
          pitcher filled with precious oil and dribbles some on the
          High Priest's hairy chest.

          OH
          How's that?

          HIGH PRIEST
          More.

          OH
          (splashes a few more drops
          on him)
          That enough?

          HIGH PRIEST
          (getting angry)
          No! More oil! Much more, you
          insolent dolt!
          Oh pours oil liberally over his chest, back, and shoulders.
          HIGH PRIEST                                                   (cont'd)
          That's good. Now rub it in.

          OH

          (APPALLED)
          With my hands?

          HIGH PRIEST
          Do it!
          Oh grimaces and starts gingerly massaging the oil into his
          hairy chest and shoulders.
          HIGH PRIEST                                                   (cont'd)
          (in ecstasy)
          Mmmmm, I love it. The sweet scent
          of precious oil. The oily--
          oiliness.
          Eema walks by with a pitcher of wine and sees Oh massaging
          the High Priest. She gasps.

          OH

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Eema! This isn't what you think.

          EEMA

          (FLUSTERED)
          No, it's fine. I understand. This
          really explains a lot about you
          that I didn't get before.

          OH
          No, really! I'm just-- rubbing oil
          on this man.
          She exits.

          HIGH PRIEST
          Mnum imam. I have an idea. Why don't
          we go back to my place and see
          what's under all that paint?

          OH

          Maya ushers Zed into the dimly lit room.

          MAYA
          Good luck.

          ZED

          MAYA--
          She leaves him. A haze of heavily scented incense hangs in
          the air.

          INANNA (O.S.)
          Come to me.
          Zed turns and sees the Princess standing on the terrace.

          Zed steps out onto the moonlit terrace. He crosses to the
          balustrade and stands beside the Princess, gazing out over
          the twinkling cityscape.

          INANNA
          Beautiful, isn't it? You can see
          Gomorrah just over the hill.

          ZED
          I didn't know it was so close.

          INANNA
          They're called the "twin cities."

          ZED
          Looks pretty from up here, but some
          people think God is going to wipe
          them out because they're so evil.

          INANNA
          (toying with him)
          And what do you think? Am I evil?

          ZED
          I don't really know you. But you
          don't look evil.

          PRINCESS
          Do you find me attractive?

          ZED
          Well, yeah. I think you're--
          incredible.

          INANNA
          (moving closer)
          I have body issues.

          ZED
          No, you're perfect. Your face,
          your hair--
          (looking into her eyes)
          Your eyes are like the sea.

          INANNA
          (a beat)
          My eyes are brown.

          ZED
          Well, it's kinda dark. I took a
          shot. I know they're big, though--
          and wet--
          She pulls him close.

          INANNA
          I don't know. I just find you--
          interesting. They say it's the
          will of the gods that some men
          should suffer while others rule--
          that we're all just victims of our
          fate. And I believed that until
          this morning when I saw you
          standing up, alone, in the square.
          And I said to myself, finally
          here's one man who refuses to bow
          down to anything--

          ZED

          UH--
          (considers explaining but
          just lets it go)
          Yeah. That's me.

          INANNA
          Yes, finally a man who has the
          courage to question the order of
          things--- a man chosen by the Gods
          to do something great.

          ZED

          (EXHILARATED)
          That's exactly what I've been
          thinking! You wouldn't believe the
          things that have been happening to
          me lately. I just didn't know why.

          INANNA
          (gets very, very close)
          I know why. To bring you here-- to
          this place-- to me.

          ZED

          (SMITTEN)
          I couldn't agree more. I'm trying
          to agree more, but I can't. That's
          how much I agree.

          INANNA
          Come.
          She takes his hand and leads him away.

          We can see torchlight flickering inside the temple and TWO
          FIGURES moving among the pillars.

          The High Priest is giving Oh a personal tour of the inner
          sanctum. Oh is scrubbed and dressed like a junior priest.

          HIGH PRIEST
          My life is devoted to the service
          of the Gods and the good of the
          people. I take nothing for myself.
          He has a huge gold ring set with precious gems on every
          finger, and a gold tiara on his head studded with rubies and
          emeralds.

          OH
          That's so-- unselfish of you.

          HIGH PRIEST
          Yes, it is. It's just so-- lonely.
          Sometimes i hunger for the touch of
          another human being.

          (COY)
          Here's a riddle: what has two

          OH
          So where does that hall lead to?

          HIGH PRIEST
          (his eyes light up)
          Come, I'll show you.
          He takes Oh's arm and leads him down the hail toward a set of
          incredibly impressive doors covered with cuneiform writing
          and arcane religious symbols.

          so powerful, that to enter is
          instant death for any mortal.

          OH
          Wow.
          (a long beat)
          So who cleans it?

          HIGH PRIEST
          it needs no cleaning.

          OH
          No, of course not.
          (can't let go of it)
          Kind of makes you wonder though--
          the guys who built it, did they
          just die the minute they finished,
          or did the Gods give them a second
          to get out?

          HIGH PRIEST
          (starting to get annoyed)
          I assume they finished it, then the
          Gods descended.

          OH
          Yeah, that's probably it.
          (another long beat)
          So you're saying we can't go in?

          HIGH PRIEST
          I just told you! To enter is
          instant death! Only I can go in
          and only once a year after very
          elaborate purification rituals and
          days of special prayers and
          offerings.

          OH

          (QUICKLY)
          Right, right, right.

          (BEAT)
          What if we just open the doors and
          stick our heads in?

          HIGH PRIEST
          Fine! Enough! I'm sorry I brought
          it up. Let's go.
          (pushes Oh along)
          Move. Move.

          Zed and Princess Inanna stealthily enter the temple.

          (looking around nervously)
          What are we doing here?

          INANNA
          I want you to enter the Holy of
          Holies.

          ZED
          Yes! Finally. Now you're talking!
          Should I enter it right here or
          should we go back to your bedroom?
          Does the Holy of Holies like to be
          entered from behind or--?

          INANNA

          (POINTS)
          That's the Holy of Holies-- you
          have to go in there and talk to the
          Gods.

          ZED
          The Gods are in there?

          INANNA
          So they say, but the only one who
          ever goes in is the High Priest.
          They say it's instant death for
          anyone else to enter.

          ZED
          Then why am I going in?

          INANNA

          (IMPATIENT)
          Because you were chosen? If the
          Gods wanted you dead they would
          have killed you already.

          ZED

          RIGHT--

          INANNA
          This is what you've been chosen
          for! To speak to the Gods and
          plead with them not to destroy the
          city. Then come back out and tell
          me what it's like inside.

          ZED
          (mulling it over)
          Right-- right. Then again, if the
          rules say--

          INANNA
          Do you always follow the rules?

          ZED
          What is it with chicks always
          wanting guys to break the rules?
          You-all have this bad boy complex----
          She kisses him fiercely on the lips.

          Do this for me.

          I'm going in.
          He enters the Holy of Holies. A FIGURE darts between the
          columns and hides in the shadows. A beam of moonlight
          reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead.

          Zed steps into the chamber and immediately prostrates
          himself, face down on the floor, arms outstretched in
          supplication. He lies there with his eyes tightly shut,
          expecting to be vaporized any second. A long moment passes
          in total silence. Then he opens his eyes and looks around
          tentatively.
          The inner chamber of the Holy of Holies is a bare room with
          marble walls lit only by shafts of moonlight from skylights
          above.

          Thank you, O-- Merciful ones, for--
          not like-- killing me, and letting
          me receive the, uh, blessing of
          your holy-- godliness.
          He exhales and closes his eyes again, waiting for some divine
          response. Nothing comes.

          ELBOWS)
          Okay, I don't know the right words--
          so I'm just going to say what I
          have to say-- if that's all right.
          (waits for a response,
          gets none, proceeds)
          I know I haven't always done the
          right thing. Eating the fruit was
          bad, I know that-- and the Cain
          thing-- and I have done somethings
          with women-- I do love the ladies--
          well, you probably know all that
          because you're watching everything--
          (a thought occurs)
          Do you really watch everything?
          That's got to be a little
          disgusting sometimes-- but probably
          pretty hot, too--

          (QUICKLY)
          Not that you would get off on any
          of it-- okay, I'm getting off the
          subject. Anyways, the word is
          you've been considering destroying
          this place. So I'm asking you not
          to-- as a personal favor.

          (NOTHING)
          Feel free to jump in anytime. I
          could use a little guidance here.
          Still no response. He rolls over onto his back.
          ZED                                               (cont'd)
          Look, I know you think this place
          is evil and it kinda is-- I see
          that-- but that's not everybody.
          There are a lot of good people,
          too. So what if there were, like,
          fifty really good people? Would
          you still destroy the city?

          (SILENCE)
          Okay, you're right, that may be a
          reach. How about twenty? I could
          probably get you twenty extremely
          good people if I really looked
          around.

          (SILENCE)
          How about five? Five awesome
          people-- including myself. I
          personally know at least five
          people worth saving. Does that
          sound good?

          Hello? A little help? Am I
          getting warm here? Okay, is it me?
          Are you punishing me for stuff I
          did?
          (an insight)
          Or setting me up for what I need to
          do. Or both! Or neither?

          (NOTHING)
          Could you give me some kind of a
          sign-- please-- anything?
          Zed listens but hears only a profound silence. Then a
          revelation. He sits up on the floor.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)
          Okay, wait. Is that the sign? The
          silence? Is that it?
          (waits for confirmation)
          It is, isn't it! Just this really
          silent-- silence.

          (PONDERING)
          You're not going to tell me what to
          do; it's up to me to decide what's
          right and what's wrong-- right? Is
          that it? You're not going to speak
          to me-- you're going to speak
          through me? If that's right, don't
          say anything.
          (listens for a beat)
          Okay, I read you loud and clear.
          Thank you.
          (an afterthought)
          Oh, and if things don't work out
          with Maya would it be okay with you
          if me and the Princess had a little
          "carnal knowledge"? Not in an evil
          way or anything--
          (he listens; silence)
          Okay! You're right, probably not a
          good idea. Thank you.
          He backs out of the Holy of Holies, bowing all the way.

          The doors to the Holy of Holies opens and Zed comes backing
          out, still bowing and muttering. Then he turns and his face
          falls.

          The High Priest, the King, the Queen, and a dozen Temple
          Acolytes are staring at him in amazement. Oh stands beside
          the High Priest dressed just like him.

          ZED
          I was just looking for the
          bathroom.

          INANNA

          Seize them!

          OH
          (scared, points at Zed)
          Seize him!
          The guards arrest Oh as Cain steps up and takes hold of Zed.

          In the dim torchlight, we see Zed hanging spread-eagle five
          feet off the ground, his arms and legs stretched out wide and
          tightly bound to iron rings imbedded in the stone.
          Oh is shackled to the wall beside him, hanging upside down.
          They hear the faint scream of a man being tortured somewhere
          deep in the prison.

          ZED
          I wish I was upside down. Looks
          fun.
          Oh won't talk to him.

          OH
          What have you done for me? I've
          been attacked by a cougar, I've
          fallen down a mountain, I almost
          had the tip of my thingy cut off,
          I've been greasing up the High
          Priest all night, and now I'm
          hanging upside down in a dungeon.
          And I have to pee real bad. All
          because of you. You call yourself
          a friend? Name one good thing
          you've done for me.

          ZED
          I've helped you come out of your
          shell.

          OH
          (in distress)
          I really have to pee--

          ZED
          Listen, I know I'm not perfect, and
          I may have made a few wrong turns,
          but you have to understand-- I'm a
          chosen. That's a lot of
          responsibility -- you can't even
          imagine.

          OH

          (ANGRY)
          The only one who thinks you're
          chosen is you, so shut up already!

          ZED

          (STUNG)
          Okay, be mad, but I'm going to get
          us out of here, if it's the last
          thing I do.
          Zed starts frantically yanking on his shackles to no avail.

          That was just my first idea-- and
          I'm also accepting ideas.

          OH

          Guard! I have to pee! Now!

          Because he's upside down, the streams runs down his stomach,
          over his chest, down his neck, onto his chin and over his
          face.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)

          A curious, jeering MOB is gathering as Zed and Oh, in
          shackles, are led by a SQUAD OF GUARDS to a raised platform
          in the middle of the square.
          The heavy pounding of martial drums silences the crowd. Cain
          presides over the execution. He addresses the crowd.

          CAIN
          For the crimes of blasphemy--
          (the crowd grumbles its

          DISAPPROVAL)

          HERESY--
          (grumble, grumble)

          CONSPIRACY--
          (serious grumbling)

          SODOMY--
          (admiring oohs and aahs)
          And the murder of my brother Abel--

          ZED
          Oh, come on!

          CAIN
          Shut up! For these and other
          crimes they may not actually have
          done yet but we're pretty sure they
          were thinking about, the prisoners
          will be stoned to death.
          The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull
          canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to
          grab stones to throw.
          Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other.

          PALACE BALCONY
          The King, Queen, High Priest and Royal Ministers observe the
          stoning from their vantage point above the square. Princess
          Inanna refuses to look.

          KING
          Observe, my dear. It seems the
          least you could do, since it was
          you who lured him to his death.
          She reluctantly turns and looks at Zed.

          INANNA
          I didn't intend for this to happen.

          THE SQUARE
          The people move in and surround the platform on all sides,
          baseball-size rocks in their hands.

          CAIN
          (to Zed and Oh)
          Anything to say before the sentence
          is carried out?

          ZED
          (to the crowd)
          I just want to say this is really
          messed up--

          CAIN

          OKAY--

          (SHOUTS)

          STONE THEM!
          The people fling their rocks with all their might.
          Zed and Oh duck.
          The rocks fly over their heads and hit people in the crowd on
          the opposite sides, several bystanders taking painful hits in
          the head, some falling down unconscious.
          Cain notes the impracticality of having people throw rocks
          from all directions.
          CAIN                                                            (cont'd)
          Okay! Stop! Halt! Hold it! This
          isn't working.

          ZED
          Can I make a suggestion?

          CAIN

          (IRKED)
          What?

          ZED
          Why don't you just pick one person
          to throw?
          The crowd thinks that's not a bad idea and murmurs agreement.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          (pressing the advantage)
          In fact, don't you think it would
          be fair for us to get to pick the
          person who stones us?
          Cain looks doubtful, but the crowd thinks this is eminently
          fair.

          CROWD
          (some eagerly raising
          their hands and waving
          like school children)
          Yes! Ooh, me! Pick me! Me!

          ON THE BALCONY
          The King grabs Sargon.

          KING
          (re Cain)
          What is that idiot doing?

          IN THE SQUARE
          Zed spots a good candidate in the crowd.

          ZED
          We pick him!
          Cain points at a BIG GUY, heavily muscled, eagerly waving his
          hand.

          CAIN
          Him?

          ZED
          No, next to him!
          He points at a BOY, about nine years old and not very big.

          CAIN
          He's just a kid!

          ZED
          So? You got something against
          kids?
          Zed plays the crowd which starts booing in disapproval.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          This guy hates kids!

          CROWD
          Yeah! What's he got against kids?
          Children are the future! Give the
          kid a shot! The kid! The kid!
          On the balcony, the King shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by
          the power of the mob. He nods to Sargon who signals to Cain.

          CAIN
          All right! All right! We'll try
          it. Kid! Grab a rock.
          The boy picks up a good-size rock.
          Zed turns to Oh.

          ZED
          Good thinking, huh?
          They turn to face the boy, ready to dodge when he throws.
          The boy winds up and fires a major league fastball that
          smacks Oh right on the forehead. The crowd cheers.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)

          OH

          (DAZED)
          I think he hit me.
          The boy fires again.
          Oh spins and tries to duck but takes the rock right on the
          head.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)
          Hey! There's two of us!
          The crowd cheers and pats the kid on the back.

          CAIN
          Okay, everybody on this side now!
          On the count of three! One-- two--

          ZED
          Wait! I have a question for the
          King!
          The crowd goes silent. All eyes turn and look up to the
          palace balcony.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)

          On the balcony, everyone is totally stopped by his question.
          One by one they all look to the High Priest who seems to be
          stumped.
          In the square, the crowd starts muttering. Zed seizes the
          initiative.
          ZED                                                            (cont'd)
          I entered the Holy of Holies and,
          lo, I did not die! Why? Because I
          am chosen by the Gods!

          PEOPLE IN THE CROWD
          He is chosen! He is the Chosen
          One. The Chosen One!
          Zed gives Oh a look: "See? I told you."

          THE CROWD
          (starts chanting)
          Spare the Chosen One! Spare the
          Chosen One! Spare the Chosen One!

          OH
          And his friend! Don't forget his
          friend!
          On the balcony, the King and his ministers hastily confer
          with the High Priest.

          KING
          Could it be? Is he truly chosen?

          HIGH PRIEST
          I don't-- I suppose it's possible-
          I'd have to examine some new

          INTESTINES--

          KING
          Imbecile!

          PRIME MINISTER
          Majesty, with respect, whether he's
          chosen or not is no longer the
          issue. To kill him now, given the
          public mood, could inflame the
          situation enough to prompt a
          radical "regime change," if you
          take my meaning.
          The King looks grimly at his ministers, all of whom have lean
          and hungry looks.
          Princess Inanna smiles contemptuously at him.

          SARGON
          By order of the King, the sentence
          has been commuted.
          The crowd cheers. Zed and Oh exchange hopeful looks.

          CAIN

          (PLAINTIVE)
          Can't we just stone them a little?

          SARGON
          It is the judgement of our most
          merciful King that the prisoners
          are to be enslaved to toil at hard
          labor until they die of exhaustion
          or starvation.

          Oh is up to his knees in a mud pit, trampling straw into the
          thick mud. A Guard cracks a bullwhip which flicks painfully
          across his shoulders.

          OH
          Okay, you think that actually makes
          anybody work harder? It just makes
          them resent you. Is that what you
          want?

          GUARD
          (whips him again)
          Faster!

          OH
          Can I just ask when lunch is?
          The whip lashes out again.
          Oh glowers at him and steps up the pace.

          Marlak and Enmebaragesi are stacking bricks when zed
          approaches.

          ZED
          (greets them)
          Hey! Boys! Long time no see.
          They glance up, but ignore him.
          ZED                                                          (cont'd)
          Don't tell me you're still mad
          about Maya. That's so over. I
          have a thing going with the
          princess now-- well, almost had a
          thing. I'm a slave now-- just like
          you.

          MARLAK
          No. You're not just like me.

          ZED
          Okay. We do have our differences--
          like about a cup and half of brain
          tissue-- but that doesn't mean we
          can't work together.
          Another GUARD approaches and whacks Marlak with his stick.

          GUARD #2
          Take those bricks to the top. The
          masons are waiting.

          Marlak and Enmebaragesi glower at the guard as they pick up
          ropes and harness themselves to a cart loaded with bricks.
          GUARD #2                                                      (cont'd)

          You! Help them!
          He grabs another rope harness off the cart and throws it to
          Zed.

          ZED
          You know, I'd like to, but I did
          something to my neck--
          (massages his neck)
          I must've slept on it funny-- those
          dungeon pillows are like rocks--
          well, they are rocks-- so I should
          probably take it easy or I'll be no
          damn good for work tomorrow.

          GUARD #2
          (strikes him across the
          back with his stick)
          I said move!

          ZED
          Okay! But I should tell you, this
          isn't really my area. I'm just on
          a break from the mud department--
          The Guard draws his short sword and raises it over Zed.

          GUARD #2
          One more word and you die--

          ZED
          (putting on the harness)
          Okay, okay. I'm going.
          (to Marlak and

          ENMEBARAGESI)
          Okay, boys, on the count of three.
          One-- two-- three!
          Marlak and Enmebaragesi lunge against the ropes, but Zed
          makes no effort to pull. They glare at him.
          ZED                                                           (cont'd)
          Learned that from Maya. Good
          trick, huh? Okay, together this
          time. Go!

          Zed, Marlak and Enmebaragesi haul the heavy cart of bricks to
          the very top of the tower.
          TWO BRICKLAYERS are working on the wall. Zed leans against
          the wall next to them tb rest.

          ZED
          How high you guys think we're going
          with this?

          BRICKLAYER ONE
          Up to Heaven, I guess. That's how
          tall they usually build 'em.

          ZED
          (looking up)
          That's ambitious.

          BRICKLAYER TWO
          We worked on the Tower of Babel.
          Now that was a ziggurat.

          BRICKLAYER ONE
          Incredible erection.
          Zed looks down at his crotch.

          ZED

          (MODESTLY)
          That's nothing. You should see it
          when I'm excited.

          BRICKLAYER ONE
          The tower.

          ZED
          Oh, right, the tower. Incredible
          erection.
          (snickers to himself)

          BRICKLAYER ONE
          See, the Egyptians are working on
          an entirely different concept.
          Four sides, slanting walls, pointy
          top.

          BRICKLAYER TWO
          Wow. Far out. Yet timeless in a
          way.
          A SLAVE CHILD approaches with a water bucket.

          SLAVE CHILD
          (to Zed)
          Want some water?
          As the child offers him the ladle, Zed recognizes her.

          ZED
          You're from the village, aren't
          you?
          The child nods.

          I bet you wish you were back there
          right now, don't you.
          The child nods again.

          Well, don't give up. You're going
          to get home someday.
          Marlak kicks Zed from behind, knocking him over.

          MARLAK
          (standing over him)
          Who's going to take her there? The
          Chosen One?
          Marlak kicks gravel and dirt in Zed's face. Zed just lies
          there and takes it, feeling like he's failed everyone.
          Then he hears the beating of drums and trumpet fanfares
          coming from the temple square below.

          To watch the sacrifice. The King
          demands it.

          OH
          Is that compulsory? Because I saw
          one when I first got here and it
          made me a little sick--
          The guard's whip catches him across the back.
          OH                                                             (cont'd)

          The square is filling up with people. The ROYAL PROCESSION
          is moving to the seats of honor to watch the sacrifice.
          Cain is now among the Royal Guard having been promoted for
          his treachery. He bows and helps the Queen to her seat.

          CAIN
          (leering seductively)
          At your service, my lady. Anytime,
          anywhere.

          QUEEN

          (FLIRTATIOUS)
          There's a depraved thought. You're
          so delightfully low. Absolute
          filth.

          CAIN

          (SUAVELY)
          Thank you, your majesty.
          He touches his tongue to the tip of his nose and waggles his
          eyebrows.
          The King arrives with Sargon to loud booing from the crowd.

          love you. They were "wooing" you.

          Yes, two, followers of the Chosen
          One, discovered by this loyal

          Burn her.-
          Sargon and Cain seize Inanna, but she shrugs them off and

          Oh and the slaves are confined behind a barrier, watched by a
          squad of guards, waiting for the ceremony to start.
          THE TEMPLE DOORS open slowly, and the High Priest appears
          holding a long jewelled staff.

          See the High Priest? I know him.
          Dear friend of mine.

          THE TEMPLE
          Now the procession of SACRIFICIAL VIRGINS is led out by the
          HIGH PRIESTESS. Maya and Eema are among them, their hands
          tied. They look like they've been drugged.

          That's far enough, slave.
          Oh stops right there, frustrated and frightened.

          THE TEMPLE
          Inanna is led out last, now also having been drugged.

          70                                                              TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT   70
          Zed, Marlak and the sharp-eyed Enmebaragesi look down, trying
          to see what's going on.

          ENMEBARAGESI
          They're bringing out the women.

          ZED

          (AMAZED)
          How are you seeing that far?

          ENMEBARAGESI
          I see your sister, Eema--

          ZED

          It's Maya!

          The drums and trumpets kick up the tempo and the High Priest
          starts leading the virgins to the idol's fiery mouth.
          Oh pushes against the barrier, restrained by the guard.

          OH
          We have to do something! Somebody
          has to stop it.
          (turning to the other

          SLAVES)
          We can't let them do this!
          The slaves start to mutter. The guards draw their swords and
          heft their spears, now on high alert.

          CUT TO:

          72                                                              TOP OF THE ZIGGURAT   72
          Zed looks around desperately, trying to figure out what to
          do.

          ZED
          (to Marlak)
          I have to get down there.

          GUARD #2

          (SNORTS)
          Over my dead body.

          MARLAK
          All right.
          Without a moment's hesitation, Marlak grabs him and tosses
          him off the top of the ziggurat. He screams all the way
          down.

          ZED
          Wow. Who saw that coming?
          Thanks, Marlak.

          MARLAK
          Now what?
          Zed looks around quickly, grabs the end of a long coiled rope
          attached to a big pulley, and hands Marlak the other end.

          ZED
          (looping the rope around
          his waist)
          Lower me down.
          Without waiting for a response, Zed bravely jumps off the top
          of the ziggurat holding the rope.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                   116.
          Marlak looks at the rope in his hands, pulls it a little and
          sees that it's not attached to the rope Zed was holding.

          CUT TO:

          ZED
          He's descending rapidly, rappelling off the side of the
          ziggurat. He looks up, expecting Marlak to belay him and
          slow him down.

          ZED

          (CALLING)
          Any time now, Marlak!
          Marlak and Enmebaragesi watch his descent, dumbly interested
          in what happens next.
          Zed sees he's not slowing down and tries to swing himself
          onto one of the upper levels of the ziggurat. However, when
          he swings in, he hits a cart loaded with bricks and bounces
          off painfully.

          THE BRICK CART
          The sudden jolt dislodges the wheel chock that was holding
          the cart on the sloping ramp of the tower. The cart starts
          to roll down the ramp, gathering speed as it careens toward
          the edge.

          He raises his staff and invokes the Gods.

          HIGH PRIEST
          We implore the great Gods of heaven

          The brick cart explodes through the scaffolding on the side
          of the ziggurat and sails into the air.

          CUT TO:

          THE ROYAL ENCLOSURE
          Everybody turns at the sound of the crash and looks up at the
          ziggurat.

          CUT TO:

          THE BRICK PITS
          The NASTY GUARD who whipped Oh earlier glances up and is
          instantly crushed by a ton of falling bricks.

          THE ZIGGURAT
          Zed is still descending as the broken scaffolding starts to
          give way.

          TEMPLE SQUARE
          The whole crowd watches in amazement as the 250                 foot
          scaffolding slowly collapses and crashes to the ground,
          bringing tons of debris with it, sending up a great cloud of
          dust.

          THE HIGH PRIEST
          He looks shocked.

          OH
          He seizes the opportunity.

          OH
          A sign! It's a sign! The Chosen
          One comes!
          The other slaves and people in the crowd pick up his
          excitement.

          CROWD
          The Chosen One! A sign from the
          Gods!

          THE HIGH PRIEST
          He doesn't quite know how to respond to the growing fervor of
          the crowd.

          HIGH PRIEST
          Yes! Well and truly, the Gods are
          with us--
          The crowd drowns him out.

          A guard is standing there staring at the rubble of the
          scaffolding as Zed comes screaming down the side of the
          ziggurat and lands right on top of him. Zed quickly strips
          the unconscious guard of his weapons, starts to run off,
          stops, comes back and grabs the guard's helmet, then takes
          off running to the temple square.

          The High Priest is getting frantic now.

          HIGH PRIEST
          Burn them! Now!
          He grabs Maya and starts dragging her toward the gaping mouth
          of the idol and the raging fire within. She struggles but is
          too drugged to put up much resistance. He grabs the
          sacramental pitcher of oil and starts sloppily anointing her.
          HIGH PRIEST                                                     (cont'd)

          May the balm of this healing oil

          (DESPERATELY)
          Don't fight it! It's the will of
          the Gods!
          Then, a voice from above.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             119.

          ZED

          (SHOUTS)
          I don't think so!
          Zed is standing atop the idol's head, brandishing a sword and
          shield.

          MAYA
          She sees him and starts to revive.

          MAYA
          Zed!

          THE HIGH PRIEST
          looks up, unable to hear Zed over the crowd noise.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (cupping his ear)
          What did you say?

          ZED

          (SHOUTS)
          I said, 'I don't think so!'

          HIGH PRIEST
          (shakes his head)
          Still not getting it.
          Zed rolls his eyes in frustration and starts tentatively
          climbing down from the top of the idol. He jumps the last
          few feet and lands right in front of the fire, blocking the
          High Priest's way.

          ZED
          I Said, 'I don't think so.'

          HIGH PRIEST

          (CONFUSED)
          You don't think what?

          ZED
          Whatever that last thing you said
          was.

          HIGH PRIEST

          (THINKS)
          I forgot.

          (SHOUTS)
          Guards!

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                            120.
          Guards rush toward Zed from all sides, but he fights like a
          demon, slashing, spinning, stabbing, fending off their blows
          with his shield.
          Oh is inspired by Zed's courage.

          OH
          (to the Edomite slave)
          I know him, too.
          Oh springs into action, attacking the big guard in front of
          him. The other slaves see that and start fighting with their
          guards, a genuine slave revolt.

          THE CROWD
          Guards start moving to help their comrades, but the spirit of
          insurrection takes hold of the crowd and people start
          grappling with the guards.
          A PLATOON OF REINFORCEMENTS comes double-timing into the
          square.
          Suddenly, A STOOPED OLD MAN throws off his cloak and pulls a
          sword. It's Abraham!

          ABRAHAM
          Death to the idolators!
          Abraham's small army of HEBREWS reveal themselves, draw their
          weapons and attack the reinforcements.
          The last Hebrew to unrobe is Isaac, who just stands there
          observing the growing chaos.

          ISAAC
          (shaking his head)
          Just fucking nuts.

          77                                                              MARLAK AND ENMEBARAGESI   77
          They come running into the battle swinging clubs, randomly
          bashing heads of soldiers and innocent civilians alike.
          Cain sees Marlak and stands his ground.

          CAIN
          Tough guy, huh? You want a piece
          of me? Get ready to have your head
          bashed in!

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                               121.
          As Cain raises his truncheon, Marlak HEAD-BUTTS him.
          CAIN                                                            (cont'd)
          (nose bleeding, stunned)
          Nice move!
          He passes out and goes down.

          He starts to panic at the full-scale revolt and rises
          nervously. His ministers surround him, he thinks to protect
          him.

          KING
          I knew I could depend on your
          loyalty.
          The ministers all draw daggers from their robes and move in
          for the kill.
          KING                                                            (cont'd)

          Oh fights his way to the temple stairs, runs up and confronts
          a PRIEST who is trying to drag Eema away. He fights with
          very little skill but tremendous energy, finally overwhelming
          the guard and grabbing Eema.

          OH
          (suddenly shy again)
          Hello, Eema.

          EEMA
          (still a little dazed)
          Oh?
          He stares at her full red lips and big blue eyes.

          OH
          (suddenly forceful)
          Eema, you're my woman! You hear
          me?

          EEMA
          Okay.

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                                    122.

          OH
          Really? It's okay?
          He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the
          mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard
          rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform,
          accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him.

          80                                                              THE HIGH PRIEST   80
          While Zed is busy with the guards, the High Priest pulls Maya
          toward the fire.
          Zed sees him, finishes the last of the guards, and starts
          slowly moving toward the High Priest who starts backing away
          until he sees Oh moving toward him from the other side. He
          holds the helpless Maya close to the flames.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (screaming and crying)
          Keep away!

          ZED
          Let her go.

          HIGH PRIEST
          (his mascara running)
          No! The Gods demand a sacrifice!
          And you ruined it!
          He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire.

          ZED
          (trying to keep him calm)
          Why don't we just sacrifice
          something small-- a rabbit maybe.
          Or a duck. That'd be good, don't
          you think?

          HIGH PRIEST

          (SCREAMS)
          No! A duck would not be good!

          OH                                                              (U.S.)
          Then how about this?
          The High Priest turns to Oh.
          Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher.
          OH                                                              (cont'd)
          More oil?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             123.
          He splashes the High Priest with a gallon of oil, soaking him
          from head to toe. As the oil hits the High Priest, Zed
          dashes across and snatches Maya from his grasp.
          The High Priest spins around in a rage, his long robes wrap
          around his legs hobbling him, he totters on his high platform
          shoes, loses his balance and gets too close to the idol's
          fiery mouth. Totally drenched in oil, he bursts into flame
          like a human torch, screams, and staggers right into the
          mouth of the furnace.

          HIGH PRIEST

          (SCREAMS)
          Hot!

          TEMPLE SQUARE
          Everyone goes silent, stunned by the incredible turn of
          events. All eyes turn to Zed and Oh, now standing before
          them on the center stage of the temple.

          ZED AND OH
          They look at each other. Someone has to say something.
          Finally, Zed clears his throat.

          ZED
          I'm the, uh, Chosen One, I guess,
          and on behalf of, well, the whole
          city, I want to thank the High
          Priest for his incredible
          sacrifice. That was really
          something, wasn't it?
          He starts clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the
          people in the square are applauding.
          At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed in
          the eye. He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady
          rain starts to fall.
          The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and they
          all roar in celebration. Then the rain stops as suddenly as
          it started. The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied
          muttering begins.

          (jumping in quickly)
          People! Friends! Sodomites!
          Okay, that was a little confusing,
          wasn't it?

          Was that a sign from God? Wasn't
          it a sign? What's the deal? We
          all want to know. But I'm not sure
          anybody really knows-- and I'd be
          real suspicious of people who say
          they do. If I've learned one
          thing, it's this: the world and
          everything in it is a miracle. And
          what that miracle means is for each
          and every one of us to figure out
          for himself. Are the Gods going to
          destroy us? Maybe-- I don't know--
          I guess it's possible. But if we
          keep going the way we are, they
          won't have to. We're doing a
          pretty good job of destroying
          ourselves. So maybe we should all
          just go home now, and think about
          what happened-- and be very, very
          good to each other. I know I'm
          going to try.
          (raises his hand in salute
          to the people)
          Peace.
          The crowd stares at him blankly. Nobody knows what to make
          of it all. Then Marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear.

          MARLAK
          All hail the Chosen One!
          With that the crowd explodes into rousing cheers.
          In the midst of the crowd, Abraham looks around and scowls.

          ABRAHAM
          What am I? Chopped liver?
          At the altar, Maya, revived now, embraces Zed.

          MAYA
          You're incredible, you know that?

          ZED
          That's what I've been trying to
          tell you.
          Zed and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the
          gratitude of the people as Inanna looks on.

          A caravan is assembling, making ready to leave the city.
          Marlak, Enmebaragesi, Maya, Eema and the other villagers are
          there, as well as a great number of freed slaves and Hebrews.
          Isaac is checking out Maya's breasts.

          ISAAC
          Hey, babe. Ever made it with a
          circumcised guy?
          Marlak grunts at him and reaches for his knife.
          ISAAC                                                           (cont'd)

          (BACKPEDALING)
          Is she with you? I did not realize
          that. Sorry.
          Marlak and Maya cross to Zed who is loading a packhorse.
          Marlak looks at him for a long moment then punches him hard
          on the shoulder.

          MARLAK

          (GRUDGING)
          You did good.
          Zed waits for more, but nothing comes.

          ZED
          (rubbing his shoulder)
          Well said, Marlak. You really have
          a way with words.
          They clasp hands.

          MARLAK
          We'll tell stories about you around
          the fire.

          ZED
          Not much to tell, is there? Just
          an average guy who saw his destiny
          and had the courage to defy a
          powerful empire. No big deal.
          Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one
          is listening to him. Zed joins him.
          ZED                                                             (cont'd)
          Everybody ready?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                          126.

          OH

          (WORRIED)
          Yeah, just about-- I guess so. The
          Hebrews are going to lead us to the
          sea and we can get boats from
          there. We can trade all this stuff
          everybody gave us for the trip
          home.

          (NERVOUS)
          I don't think I should be the
          leader. Nobody's listening to me.

          EEMA
          (by his side)
          I'll listen to you.
          Oh swells up with pride.

          OH
          (turns to Zed)
          Come back to the village sometime.
          Zed nods, they shake hands, then they embrace. Stifling a
          tear, Oh breaks away and whips the lead camel.
          OH                                                           (cont'd)
          (shouting at camel)
          Hee-ya!
          (beat, quietly to camel)
          Come on. People are watching.
          The camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off.
          Oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow.
          As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing there
          with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground
          beside him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet.
          Maya joins him.

          MAYA
          Where will you go now?

          ZED
          Might head down to Egypt. I hear
          it's a happening kinda place.

          MAYA
          Are you going alone?

          ZED
          Not necessarily. You want to come?

          

          

          

          
          Official White                                                             127.

          MAYA
          I'll get my things.
          She gestures off and he sees a small train of camels and
          horses loaded with a ton of her personal possessions.
          MAYA (cont'd)
          The Princess gave me a few gifts
          when she freed us.

          ZED
          Traveling light, huh? Okay, here
          we go.

          (POINTS)
          To the west!

          MAYA
          (correcting him)
          That's west.

          ZED
          I knew that. Just wanted to see if
          you did.
          Zed grins and they start walking, passing a small herd of
          sheep and goats, tended by VEILED WOMEN, going in the
          opposite direction.
          As THE LAST OF THE SHEPHERD WOMEN passes, we notice something
          masculine about her build and posture. Zed nods politely to
          her, but she averts her eyes and turns away from him.

          CAIN
          (in a high unconvincing
          woman's voice)
          Peace--- brother.
          zed does a double take at the voice, shrugs, and walks off
          with Maya-- as a torrential rain begins to fall.

							2nd Final White revised
							February 2, 1998

	

	FADE IN ON:

	CYBERSPACE

	We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a
	sky that's just beginning to get light.  There are a few
	stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big
	computer sun starts to rise.

	We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading
	over a computer version of the New York City skyline.  We
	move over Central Park.  It's fall and the leaves are
	glorious reds and yellows.

	We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down
	Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and
 	turn onto a street in the West 80s.

	Hold in front of a New York brownstone.

	At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the
	words:

	ADDING ART

	As the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a percentage
	increase from 0% to 100%.  When it hits 100% the image pops and 
	we are in real life.

	EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - DAY

	Early morning in New York. A couple of runners pass on their
	way to Riverside Drive Park.

	We go through the brownstone window into:

	INT. KATHLEEN KELLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

	KATHLEEN KELLY is asleep.  Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and
	fresh as a spring day.  Her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized
	bed and a desk with a computer on it.  Bookshelves line every
	inch of wall space and overflow with books.  Framed on the
	children's classic.  Madeleine.

	As Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into
	the room.  He wears blue jeans and a workshirt.  He's carrying
	the New York Times.

				KATHLEEN
		Good morning.

				FRANK
			(as he reads)
		Listen to this -- the entire work force
		of the state of Virginia had to have
		solitaire removed from their computers --

	Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the
	bathroom, and we stay with Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		-- because they hadn't done any work in
		six weeks.

	Kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe.

				KATHLEEN
		Aren't you late?

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You know what this is, you know what
		we're seeing here?  We're seeing the end
		of Western civilization as we know it.

				KATHLEEN
		This is so sad.

	She tosses him his jacket.

				FRANK
			(points at her computer)
		You think that machine is your friend,
		but it's not.
			(checks his watch)
		I'm late.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	As Frank walks to the apartment door.  We see a charming room
	with a couch, fireplace, books, and a dining table with a 
	typewriter with a cover on it.

				KATHLEEN (O.C.)
		I'll see you tonight.

				FRANK
		Sushi.

				KATHLEEN (O.C.)
		Great.  Bye.

	Frank goes out the door.  It closes.

	Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye
	peephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing
	from sight.  She walks into:

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	And looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the
	street and turns toward Broadway.

	He's gone.  Good.

	She sits down at her computer.  An expression of anticipation
	and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse.

	INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's
	code name: Shopgirl.  She logs on and the computer makes all
	its little modem noises as the computer dials the access
	number and connects and we hear the machine:

				COMPUTER
		Welcome.

	And we see Kathleen, listening for the words she's waiting to
	hear:

				COMPUTER (cont'd)
		You've got mail.

	And Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up:

	INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	We see a list of letters:

	Big Cash Op: You can make $$$ in your spare time.  OIL MKT: You
	can turn $20 into $20,000 THIS REALLY WORKS U CAN DO IT: 
	Maximize your selling ability nowwwww!!!  NY152 Brinkley

	Kathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters --
	all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.

	Then she selects the "Read Mail" key for "NY 152 Brinkley".

	And the letter comes up:
		   To: Shopgirl
		From: NY152
		   Re: Brinkley

	Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud:

				KATHLEEN
		Brinkley is my dog.  He loves the streets
		of New York as much as I do --

	And now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of
	NY 152, a man named JOE FOX --

				JOE (V.O.)
		-- although he likes to eat bits of pizza
		and bagel off the sidewalk, and I prefer
		to buy them.  Brinkley is a great catcher
		and was offered a tryout on the Mets farm
		team --
			(continued)

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. This
	is BRINKLEY.  The pillow has "Brinkley" embroidered on it.
	Brinkley's master, JOE FOX, a great-looking guy, full of
	charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself
	some orange juice.  He's half-dressed.

				JOE (cont'd)
		-- but he chose to stay with me so that
		he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on
		a large green pillow the size of an inner
		tube.  Don't you love New York in the
		fall?  It makes me want to buy school
		supplies.  I would send you a bouquet of
		newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your
		name and address.  On the other hand,
		this not knowing has its charms.

				VOICE
		Darling --

				JOE
		Mmmmmhmmm --

	Joe's girlfriend PATRICIA EDEN, in Armani head to toe, comes
	into the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine,
	which starts grinding beans.  She's carrying the morning
	papers.

				PATRICIA
		I'm late.
			(indicating the newspaper)
		Random House fired Dick Atkins.  Good
		riddance.  Murray Chilton died.  Which
		makes one less person I'm not speaking 
		to --
			(she drains a cup of espresso
			 as a second starts to come out
			 of the machine)
		Vince got a great review.  He'll be
		insufferable.  Tonight,  PEN dinner --

				JOE
		Am I going?

				PATRICIA
		You promised.

				JOE
		Can't I just give them money?  That's the
		cause?  Free Albanian writers?  I'm for
		that.

	Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.

			     JOE
		All right, I'll go.  You're late.

			     PATRICIA
		I know I know I know.

	She tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her.

	Hold on Joe, listening as he hears the elevator door open and
	close on the landing outside.

	IT. JOE'S DEN - DAY

	As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs 
	on.

			     JOE & THE COMPUTER (TOGETHER)
		Welcome... You've got mail.

	And as he starts to read his letter, we hear:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I like to start my notes to you as if
		we're already in the middle of a
		conversation.  I pretend that we're 
		the oldest and dearest friends --
		as opposed to what we actually are,
		people who don't know each other's names
		and met in a Chat Room where we both
		claimed we'd never been before.

	INT. JOE'S ELEVATOR - DAY

	As Joe, dressed for work, takes the elevator down with his
	elevator man CHARLIE.  There's a certain amount of Good
	morning, etc., as the elevator goes down and the voice-over
	continues:

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		What will he say today, I wonder.  I turn
		on my computer, I wait impatiently as it
		boots up.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - DAY

	As Joe comes out of his building.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		I go on line, and my breath catches in my
		chest until I hear three little words:
		You've got mail.

	And the camera now pans from 152 Riverside uptown to:

	EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - MORNING

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		I hear nothing, not even a sound on the
		streets of New York, just the beat of my
		own heart.  I have mail.  From you.

	EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

	As Kathleen comes onto Broadway at the corner of 83rd Street
	and starts downtown.

	Through a long lens we can see Joe, walking into blocks behind
	her.

	As Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the
	West Side of Manhattan in the morning.  Mothers and fathers
	taking their kids to school, people on their way to work,
	dogs being walked.  School buses picking up kids, bakery
	trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of
	unopened restaurants.

	Kathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the 
	newsstand dealer, and picks up a New York Times.

	Metal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons,
	the pharmacy, fish store, the Cuban Chinese Restaurant,
	Zabar's.

	Joe stops at the same newsstand.  He buys all the papers --
	the Times, Wall Street Journal, Post and Daily News.

	INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Kathleen picks up her coffee, walks out.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	As Kathleen walks down Columbus, we see Joe a block behind
	her.  She stops to buy flowers and Joe passes her, crosses to
	the Ease side of Columbus Avenue.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	A building under construction, with plywood board covering
	the front and wrapping around the corner.  Joe goes to a side
	entrance and enters.

	EXT. COLUMBUS & 73RD STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in
	front of her store, a children's bookstore called "The Shop
	Around the Corner."  It is an irresistibly inviting store.
	There are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large
	stuffed animals reading children's books: Madeleine, Good
	Night Moon, Where the Wild Things Are.  A teddy bear in a 
	pinafore is reading The Stupids Step Out.  Waiting for
	Kathleen in front is one of her employees, CHRISTINA.

				KATHLEEN
		Hello, Christina.  It's a beautiful day.
		Isn't it the most beautiful day?

	Christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first
	time.

				CHRISTINA
		I guess.  Yeah, sure.

	Kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which
	rises, making a horrible noise.  Two cabs almost collide in
	front of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts
	yelling obscenities at the other.  Kathleen unlocks the door
	to the store.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't you love New York in the fall?

	Christina looks at her puzzled.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen turns the CLOSED sign on the door over to read
	"OPEN" and she activates the computer system.  She looks
	around, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore,
	with wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read,
	some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions
	of the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland, etc.  There's a 
	playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered
	with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "The Ten Best
	Witch List"  and a collection of witch books -- "The Lion, The 
	Witch and the Wardrobe," "The Witches," "The Wizard of Oz."
	On the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops.

	Kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and
	suddenly stops to daydream.  A smile creeps onto her face.
	Christina looks at her.

				CHRISTINA
		What's going on with you?

				KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

				CHRISTINA
		You're in love.

				KATHLEEN
		In love?  No.  Yes.  Of course I am.
		I'm in love with Frank.  I'm practically
		living with Frank.  Do you think you
		could get our Christmas mailers out this
		week?

				CHRISTINA
		By Monday I promise.  I have a paper due
		Friday.  Now what's going on?
			(she looks at Kathleen)
		I'm just going to stand here till you tell
		me.

	A beat.

				KATHLEEN
		Is it infidelity if you're involved with
		someone on E-mail?

				CHRISTINA
		Have you had sex?

				KATHLEEN
		Of course not.  I don't even know him.

				CHRISTINA
		I mean cybersex.

				KATHLEEN
		No!

				CHRISTINA
		Well, don't do it.  The minute you do,
		they lose all respect for you.

				KATHLEEN
		It's not like that.  We just E-mail.
		It's really nothing, on top of which I'm
		definitely thinking of stopping because
		it's getting --

				CHRISTINA
		Out of hand?

				KATHLEEN
		Confusing.  But not really.  Because it's
		nothing.

				CHRISTINA
		Where did you meet him?

				KATHLEEN
		I can't even remember.
			(off Christina's look)
		The day I turned thirty I wandered into
		the Over Thirty Room for a joke, sort of
		and he was there, and we started 
		chatting.

				CHRISTINA
		About what?

				KATHLEEN
		Books.  Music.  How much we both love New
		York.  Harmless.  Harmless.  Meaningless.
			(starts smiling)
		Bouquets of sharpened pencils.

				CHRISTINA
		Excuse me?

				KATHLEEN
		Forget it.  We don't talk about anything
		personal.  We made a rule about that.
		I don't know his name, what he does or
		exactly where he lives, so it will be
		really easy to stop seeing him, because
		I'm not.

				CHRISTINA
		God, he could be the next person to talk
		into the store.  He could be...
			(as George walks in)
		George.

	GEORGE PAPPAS, in his twenties, one of Kathleen's 
	salespeople, is a cute guy who has no idea that he's supposed
	to look in the mirror when he gets dressed.

				GEORGE
		Morning.

				CHRISTINA
		Are you On Line?

				GEORGE
		As far as I'm concerned, the Internet is
		just another way to be rejected by a 
		woman.

	BIRDIE walks in.  She is in her seventies, has white hair,
	and is tiny, like a little sparrow.  She is the store's
	oldest employee, having worked there for over forty years,
	and serves as a accountant as well as salesperson.

				KATHLEEN
		Good morning, Birdie.

				BIRDIE
		What are you all talking about?

				CHRISTINA
		Cybersex.

				BIRDIE
		I tried to have cybersex once but I kept
		getting a busy signal.

				CHRISTINA
		I know, I know.  One Saturday night I was
		really depressed about not having a date,
		so I thought, no problemo, I'll go on
		line and I won't be lonely, but I 
		couldn't get on, there were hundreds of
		thousands of people who didn't have dates
		trying to get on.
			(MORE)
		You have to wonder which is harder,
		getting a date or getting On Line when
		you don't have a date.

				GEORGE
		Getting a date is harder.

	We hear the bell jingle as TWO WEST SIDE MOTHERS come in with 
	two KIDS IN STROLLERS.

				KATHLEEN
			(to the kids)
		Jessica and Maia, how are you today?

	We hear the sound of the garbage truck.  Kathleen goes out
	the front door to:

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As the commercial garbage truck pulls up and TWO GARBAGEMEN 
	start to load her trash.

				KATHLEEN
		Hey, you forgot to pick up the garbage
		last week and I got a ticket.  And you're
		late today -- I could have gotten
		another.

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		We were here, there was no garbage.

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

				KATHLEEN
		Of course there was --

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		What do you think, I don't want to pick
		up garbage?  You think I go up and down
		the street picking up garbage, I'm not
		going to pick up yours?  What's the
		matter with you?

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

	Kathleen is standing there, tongue-tied.
	
				GARBAGEMAN #1
		You don't even bundle it right, you're
		supposed to bundle it and leave it near
		the curb, you leave it near the store
		and you use cheap garbage bags, they
		smear all over the place, and then I got
		to pick it up with my shovel --

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	As Christina, who's helping one of the customers, looks out
	the window as the harangue continues.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		And now you're busting my chops.  You're
		just another garbage pick-up to us, okay?

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

	As Kathleen continues to stand there, speechless.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen comes back into the store.  Christina is ringing
	up a sale.

				KATHLEEN
		That guy went ballistic on me.

				CHRISTINA
		I hope you told him off.

				KATHLEEN
		Not exactly.

	Another customer enters the store.  The bell jingles.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE ON COLUMBUS - DAY

	A little truck carrying a knife sharpener, its bells ringing,
	passes the building under construction.

	INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

	WORKERS, ELECTRICIANS, MASONS, CARPENTERS, etc. in the 
	process of building what looks like a large store.  Wires
	hanging everywhere.

				KEVIN
		The electrical contractor called.  His
		truck hit a deer last night, he won't be
		in 'til tomorrow.  The shelves are late
		because the shipment of pine had beetles.
		And there's some question about whether
		we're installing the stairs in the right
		spot --

				JOE
		That sounds great.

				KEVIN
		Testing one two three four.

				JOE
		Is the electrician here?

				KEVIN
		I just told you -- he hit a deer.

				JOE
		I hear nothing.  Not a sound on the city
		streets, just the beat of my own heart.
		I think that's the way it goes.
		Something like that.

				KEVIN
			(beginning to glean something)
		Did you and Patricia get engaged?

				JOE
		Engaged?  Are you crazy?

				KEVIN
		I thought you liked Patricia --

				JOE
		I love Patricia.  Patricia's amazing.
		Patricia makes coffee nervous.
			(suddenly all business)
		Are we still on schedule?

				KEVIN
		We open two weeks before Thanksgiving.

				JOE
		I guess we should announce ourselves
		soon.  Tell people we're coming.

				KEVIN
		This is the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
		The minute they hear they'll be lining up
		--

				JOE
		-- to picket --

				KEVIN
		-- the big bad --

				JOE
		--chain store --

				KEVIN
		-- that destroys --

				JOE
		-- everything we hold dear.  But we'll
		seduce them with our square footage and
		our deep armchairs and our amazingly
		swift checkout lines and our discounts
		and our...

				JOE & KEVIN
			(the trump card)
		-- cappuccino.

				JOE
		They hate us in the beginning, but we 
		get them in the end.  Meanwhile we 
		should just put up a sign -- Coming soon, 
		a Foxbooks Superstore and The End of
		Western Civilization As We Know It.

	INT. FOXBOOKS - WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	Joe is in the office with his father, NELSON FOX, and his
	grandfather, SCHUYLER FOX.  The office has been recently
	redecorated; everything is new and a little overdone.

	On the wall we see the Foxbooks logo.

				JOE
		Kevin and I are both a little concerned
		about the neighborhood response --
			(suddenly notices the garish
			 couch)
		What is this fabric?  Does it have a
		name?

				NELSON
		Money.  Its name is money.

				JOE
		Gillian selected it.

				NELSON
		Of course.

				SCHUYLER
		Your father is getting married again.

				JOE
		Oh, great, congratulations, Dad.  Why?

				NELSON
		Who knows?  Why does anyone get married?

				JOE
		Love.

				NELSON
		Yes, that is one reason.

				SCHUYLER
		I think you're a damn fool.

				NELSON
		Dad, Matthew is four.  It would be nice
		for him if his parents were married.

				SCHUYLER
		Annabel is eight and I'm not married to
		her mother.  I can't even remember her
		mother's name.
			(he laughs merrily)

				JOE
		I have a very sad announcement to make.
		City Books on 23rd Street is going under
		...

	Nelson, Shuyler, and Joe high-five each other.

				NELSON
		Another independent bookstore bites the
		dust --

				SCHUYLER
		On to the next.

				JOE
		And I'm buying their entire stock --
		architecture, New York history -- for the
		new store.

				NELSON
		How much are your paying?

				JOE
		Whatever it costs, it won't be as much as
		this exquisite mohair episode.
			(indicates the couch)
		We're also going to have a section on
		West Side Writers --

				SCHUYLER
		-- as a sop to the neighborhood.

				NELSON
		Perfect.  It'll keep those West Side
		liberal nut pseudo-intellectual bleeding
		hearts --

				JOE
		Readers.  They're called readers.

				NELSON
		Don't romanticize them.  It'll keep them
		from jumping down your throat --

				SCHUYLER
		What's the competition?

				JOE
		One mystery store.  Sleuth, on 86th and
		Amsterdam.  And a children's bookstore.
		The Shop Around the Corner.  Been there
		forever.

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia's store.

				JOE
		Who's that?

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia Kelly, lovely woman.  I think we
		might have had a date once.  Or maybe we
		just exchange letters.

				JOE
		You wrote her letters?

				SCHUYLER
		Mail.  It was called mail.

				NELSON
			(fondly nostalgic and kidding
			 it slightly)
		Stamps.  Envelopes.

				JOE
		Wait.  I've heard of it.  It was a means
		of communication before I was born.

				NELSON
		Exactly.

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia had beautiful penmanship.
		She was too young for me, but she was...
		enchanting.  Her daughter owns it now.

				NELSON
		Too bad for her.

	As a DECORATOR walks into the office carrying a pile of
	upholstered pillows, and Joe turns to look at them.

				COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
		Welcome.  You've got mail.

				JOE (V.O.)
		My father is getting married again.  For
		five years he's been living with a woman
		who studied decorating at Caesar's
		Palace.

				COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
		You've got mail.

	INT. SUBWAY - DAY

	Kathleen looks up from her book as a butterfly flies through
	the subway car.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Once I read a story about a butterfly in
		the subway, and today I saw one. I
		couldn't believe it.  It got on at 42nd
		--
			(continued)

	The train comes to a stop.  The butterfly flies out.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		-- and got off at 59th, where I assume it
		was going to Bloomindale's to buy a hat
		that will turn out to be a mistake.  As
		almost all hats are.

	EXT. H & H BAGELS - NIGHT

	A flour truck is unloading flour into a hole in the ground.

				JOE (V.O.)
		Did you know that every night a truck
		pulls up to H&H Bagels and pumps about a
		ton of flour into the ground?  The air is
		absolutely amazing.

	As Joe comes around the corner and sees the dust filling the
	air.  It is amazing.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I guess I've read Pride & Prejudice about
		100 times --

	INT. JOE'S KITCHEN - DAY

	As Joe reads a copy of Pride and Prejudice.  He can't stand
	it.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		-- and every time I read it I worry that
		Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are not going to
		get together -- but the truth is whenever
		I think about my favorite book I always
		think about the books I read as a child --

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As Kathleen takes a copy of Homer Price off the shelf.

				JOE (V.O.)
		Did you ever read Homer Price?  My all-
		time favorite children's book.
			(continued)

	She opens it to the illustration of the doughnut machine that
	won't stop making doughnuts.

				JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		There's a doughnut machine in it that
		won't stop making doughnuts, they just
		keep coming down the chute just as
		regular as a clock can tick.

	EXT. KRISPY KREME STORE - DAY

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Have you been to Krispy Kreme?
			(continued)

	Joe, eating a doughnut, looks through the window at the huge
	doughnut machine as the doughnuts roll down the chute just as
	regular as a clock can tick.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		There's a doughnut machine right in the
		window that makes 110 dozen doughnuts an
		hour.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Joe leaves with his morning coffee.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NEW YORK - MORNING

	Joe goes to his painter at work: COMING SOON is as far as he's
	gotten.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	She enters Starbucks.

	INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Kathleen buys her morning coffee and listens to everyone
	ordering.

	We can hear the sounds of Starbucks: "Short decaf cap,"  "Tall
	mocha latte."  "Grande lowfat regular."  Etc.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - A HALF HOUR LATER

	The painter is further along on the sign.  It now reads:
	COMING SOON, A FOXBOOKS SU --

	Kathleen walks past the construction site.  She doesn't
	really pay attention to the sign painter.

	We see two police cars barreling up 75th Street, followed by
	a television news truck.

	EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

	The police cars and TV truck barrel uptown.

	EXT. 101st STREET - CONTINUOUS

	They turn left onto West 101st and stop in front of an
	apartment building on the block.  There are more police cars
	and a horde of television reporters with microphones, etc.

	George emerges from the building as a newscaster broadcasts.

				TV REPORTER
		The body of a woman was found this
		morning on the roof of a New York
		building...

	As George comes out of his building into a horde of REPORTERS
	with microphones, cameras, etc. and listens to the reporter,
	who, seeing George, sticks the microphone into his face.

				TV REPORTER
		Here is a resident of the building.  Your
		name, please?

				GEORGE
		George Pappas.

				REPORTER
		Did you see or hear anything unusual last
		night?

				GEORGE
		No.  I didn't go out.

	At that moment, George sees a young woman.  This is MEREDITH
	CARTER.  He is struck dumb.

				REPORTER
		The victim was red-haired, about thirty-
		five, wearing a jogging suit.  Did you
		encounter anyone by that description
		in the building?  Sir?

	George hasn't heard a word.

				REPORTER
		Have there been any wild parties 
		lately?

	George doesn't answer.

				REPORTER
		Could it perhaps be one of your
		neighbors?

	George continues to stare at the beautiful woman.  As he
	does, she notices him.  She stares back.  The reporter,
	ignored, finally turns away.

				REPORTER
			(to camera)
		As you can see, no one here knows
		anything.

	He continues to stand there, dumbstruck for a moment.
	Meredith Carter starts to walk away.

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As George walks along Broadway, past the sign, which now
	says: "COMING SOON: A FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE".  He sees it.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	Kathleen and several CUSTOMERS in the store.

	George walks in and goes to the back to hang up his coat.
	Christina is unpacking boxes.  Birdie is at the desk.  George
	looks at Christina meaningfully.

				CHRISTINA
			(totally mystified)
		What?

				GEORGE
		The coup de foudre. I had one. I
		never believed in them, but I just had
		one.

				BIRDIE
		Is that the thing where you get cold
		suddenly, bang?

				CHRISTINA
		No, that's the coup de vieux.

				BIRDIE
		I had that.

				GEORGE
		The coup de foudre is where you get
		love suddenly, bang.  A thunderbolt.

				BIRDIE
		I had that too.  Only I had it in
		Seville, where it was called ,el
		estruendo de amor.

				GEORGE
		I don't know her name, or anything about
		her.  I may never see her again.

				CHRISTINA
		And if you ever do meet her, you'll find
		out all the horrible details, and that
		will be that.  She'll turn out to have
		pictures of the Virgin Mary all over the
		walls.

				GEORGE
		I won't care.

	Kathleen sticks her head into the back.

				KATHLEEN
		Can someone help me out here?

				CHRISTINA
		George had a coup de foudre.

				GEORGE
		And Christina's making fun of me.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't let her.  I believe in this, I
		completely believe in this.  It happened
		to Madame Bovary, at least six times.

				CHRISTINA
		And she was wrong every time.

				KATHLEEN
		Yes!
			(beat)
		Who was she?

				GEORGE
		I don't know.  She was standing outside
		my building with the police and the
		reporters.

				KATHLEEN
		What police and reporters?

				GEORGE
		Someone died.

				KATHLEEN
		Who?

				GEORGE
		I have no idea about that either.
		They found her on the roof.

				KATHLEEN
		A dead body.  That's so sad.  But
		you fell in love.  That's so great.

				GEORGE
		Oh.  One other thing.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	The sign is now complete and it says: "Coming soon, just
	around the corner.  A Foxbooks Superstore."

	Kathleen and George and Christina stand there looking at it.

				CHRISTINA
		Quel nightmare.

				KATHLEEN
		It has nothing to do with us. It's
		big, impersonal, overstocked and 
		full of ignorant salespeople.

				GEORGE
		But they discount.

				KATHLEEN
		But they don't provide any service.  We
		do.

	George and Christina nod.

	INT. BARNEY GREENGRASS - LUNCHTIME

	Kathleen is having lunch with Birdie.

				KATHLEEN
		So really it's a good development.  You
		know how in the flower district, there
		are all these flower shops in a row so
		you can find whatever you want.  Well,
		this is going to be the book district.
		If you don't have it, we do.

				BIRDIE
		And vice versa.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	Kathleen in the kitchen, unloading groceries.  Frank is
	standing there, plugging in an Olympia Report deluxe Electric
	typewriter.

				FRANK
		When you are finished with Foxbooks, the
		Shop Around the Corner is going to be
		responsible for reversing the entire
		course of the Industrial Revolution.

				KATHLEEN
		That is so sweet, Frank.  Thank you.
		That is so sweet.

				FRANK
		Hey --

	He holds his arms out.  They hug.

				KATHLEEN
		Although...

				FRANK
		What?

				KATHLEEN
			(over his shoulder, she notices
			 the typewriter, breaks from
			 the hug)
		What is that doing there?

				FRANK
		Listen to it.  Just listen--

	He strikes a key.  Practically swoons.

				FRANK
		The Olympia Report deluxe Electric
		Report.  As in gunshot.

				KATHLEEN
		That sound is familiar.

				FRANK
		Now listen to this.

	He puts his ear to the typewriter.

	Kathleen listens too.

				KATHLEEN
		That whirring?

				FRANK
		The gentle and soothing lullaby of a
		piece of machinery so perfect --

				KATHLEEN
		I know where I've heard it before.  I
		know.

	She whips a cover off the other typewriter on the table.
	It's the same machine exactly.

				FRANK
		I needed a backup.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't you have another one at your
		apartment?

				FRANK
		I might, I might.  So what?

				KATHLEEN
		You're turning my apartment into a
		typewriter museum.

				FRANK
		I'll stop.  I'll try.  I probably can't.
		I see one and my knees go weak.  Anyway,
		what were you starting to say?

				KATHLEEN
		When?

				FRANK
		Before.

				KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

				FRANK
		Come on.

				KATHLEEN
		I don't know.  I was just wondering about
		my work and all.  I mean, what is it I do
		exactly?  All I really do is run a 
		bookstore --

				FRANK
		All you really do is this incredibly
		noble thing --

	Kathleen nods.

				KATHLEEN
		But I don't know if I --

				FRANK
			(stopping her)
		Kathleen --

				KATHLEEN
		But I just --

				FRANK
		You are a lone reed.

	Kathleen looks puzzled.

	He sticks a piece of paper in the typewriter, starts typing.

				FRANK
		You are a lone reed waving in the 
		breeze standing strong and tall in 
		the corrupt sands of commerce.

	He whips the piece of paper out of the typewriter and hands
	it to her.

				KATHLEEN
			(reading from it)
		I am a lone reed.
			(tries it on again)
		I am a lone reed.

	Clutching her piece of paper, she wanders into the bathroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

	We hear the sound of a typewriter begin to clack away in the
	next room.

	Kathleen walks past her computer, looks at it.  Then she goes
	over to the window, looks out at her street at dusk.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DUSK

	A group of schoolgirls in uniform, in two straight lines,
	walk past with a tall woman.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DUSK

	She goes over to the bookshelf and pulls out a copy of
	Madeleine by Ludwig Bemelmans and opens it to the
	illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight lines
	marching through the streets of Paris.  She looks at it, then
	looks up, lost in thought.  We hear the sound of the computer
	keys.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Sometimes I wonder about my life.  I lead
		a small life.  Well, not small, but
		circumscribed.  And sometimes I wonder,
		do I do it because I like it, or because
		I haven't been brave?  So much of what I
		see reminds me of something I read in a
		book, when shouldn't it be the other way
		around?
			(continued)

	And hold on her as she thinks about this.

	In the other room, we hear Frank typing.

	Kathleen goes to the computer, turns it on.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	As we see Kathleen, through her curtains, a small figure
	barely lit by her computer.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		I don't really want an answer.  I just
		want to send this cosmic question out
		into the void.  So goodnight, dear void.

	INT. DRIP - DAY

	Drip is a cafe on Amsterdam Avenue with Fifties-style couches
	and chairs in cozy seating arrangements.  Kathleen is
	standing at the front counter with Christina, getting drinks.

				CHRISTINA
		I went to the Foxbooks Website and you
		can buy anything.  They ship it to you
		in a day.  Maybe we should get a website.

				KATHLEEN
		My mother would never have wanted us to
		have a website.  "Every book you sell is
		a gift from your heart."  She always said
		that.

	As they walk toward the back of the cafe, Kathleen notices a 
	stack of loose-leaf binders on the table.

				CHRISTINA
		What if they put us out of business?

				KATHLEEN
		It's out of the question.  We're a
		fixture in the neighborhood.  We're
		practically a landmark.
			(indicating the binders)
		Men For Women, Women for Men, Women for
		Women -- what is this?

				CHRISTINA
		You fill out one of these forms and they
		file it in the book and if someone wants
		to meet you, they arrange it.

				KATHLEEN
		What a stupid way to meet someone.

				CHRISTINA
		Compared to the Internet?

				KATHLEEN
		My little thing on the Internet is just
		a lark.

				CHRISTINA
		So it's still going on?

				KATHLEEN
		And I do not plan to meet him.
			(indicating the book)
		Why do I get the feeling that you are in
		here somewhere?

	Christina flips the book open to her application.

				CHRISTINA
		I came in here one night and drank too
		much coffee and filled one out.
			(off Kathleen's look)
		Well how am I supposed to meet someone?

				KATHLEEN
		You are a runner.  Some day you will make
		eye contact with another runner and --

				CHRISTINA
		No one ever even looks at me.  They
		don't.  On top of which, who are they?
		They could like the symphony.  I could
		never fall in love with someone who 
		likes to go to the symphony --

				KATHLEEN
		I know.  What are you supposed to do
		there?

				CHRISTINA
		I don't know.

				KATHLEEN
		Sit.  You're supposed to sit.

				CHRISTINA
		I could never fall in love with anyone
		who smokes cigars either.

				KATHLEEN
		I'll tell you what I hate.  Big fat legs
		like stumps.

				CHRISTINA
		Yeah.  I hate that too.

				KATHLEEN
		The worst, the worst -- I could never,
		under any circumstances, love anybody
		who had a sailboat.

				CHRISTINA
		Neither could I.

				KATHLEEN
		If I had to get up on Saturday morning
		knowing that I was about to go down to
		the pier and unravel all those ropes and
		put on all that sunblock --

				CHRISTINA
		All that talk about the wind.

				KATHLEEN
		And then you have to go out on the boat,
		and you sail and sail and sail until you
		are bored witless, and then, only then,
		do they say, let's turn around and you
		realize the trip is only half over, only
		it's not, because the wind has changed --

				CHRISTINA
		It hasn't changed.  It's died.

				KATHLEEN
		So then there's more talk about the wind.
		While you just float up and down trying
		not to get nauseous.  And when you
		finally get back, you have to clean up
		the boat.

				CHRISTINA
		Why don't people have boat maids?

				KATHLEEN
		I know.  There're all these people who
		wouldn't be caught dead polishing a
		doorknob in their house but put them on 
		a boat and they want to rub down 
		everything in sight.
		
	EXT. 19TH STREET BOAT BASIN - ANOTHER DAY

	Joe is on his sailboat.  He is polishing his brass and
	whistling.

				ANNABEL
		Joe --

	Joe jumps off the boat onto the dock to greet his
	grandfather's daughter ANNABEL, 8, who is coming toward the
	dock with GILLIAN, his father's overdecorated 32-year-old
	fiance, her son, MATTHEW, 4, and the Nanny, MAUREEN.

				JOE
		Hello.
			(picks up Annabel)
		Annabel, how are you today?

				ANNABEL
		Great.

				JOE
			(picks up Matt)
		Hey, big guy --

				GILLIAN
		Don't I get a hello?

				JOE
		Hello, Gillian.

				GILLIAN
		Kiss me.  I'm going to be your wicked
		stepmother.

	Joe gives her a peck on the cheek.

				JOE
		Who is this?

				GILLIAN
		Nanny Maureen.  I brought her in case
		you couldn't handle the kids.

				ANNABEL
		Maureen's getting a divorce.

				JOE
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				MAUREEN
		It's my own fault.  Never marry a man
		who lies.

				JOE
		That is so wise.  Remember that, Annabel.

				ANNABEL
		She taught Matt to spell his name.

				MATT
		Fox. F-O-X.

				JOE
		Excellent, Matt.
			(to Maureen)
		Good work.  You can have the day off.
		I'll take over from here.
			(to Gillian)
		You must be late for something.
		Volunteer work at the Henry Street
		Settlement.  Packing bandages for
		Bosnian refugees.  A course in 
		Chinese literature at Columbia.

				GILLIAN
		I am.  I'm having my eggs harvested.

	EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY

	There's a block street fair with little booths, sausage
	sandwich concessions, etc.  Annabel and Matt have been to the
	makeup booth.  Annabel is a cat and Matt is a pirate.
	Annabel is carrying a goldfish in a baggie as they walk toward
	Broadway.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

	As Joe, Annabel and Matt walk past.  There's some sort of toy
	miniature princess in a pointed hat sitting outside the store
	and a sign lit with twinkle lights: Storybook Lady today 3:30.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

	Kathleen is sitting on a stool reading to a group of CHILDREN,
	including Annabel and Matt, who are crammed into her store.
	Joe is watching, along with some PARENTS as Kathleen reads 
	from a Roald Dahl book.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - LATER

	Matt is sitting on the floor reading a book.  Kathleen is 
	showing Annabel a copy of a book called Betsy-Tacy.

				KATHLEEN
		This is her best friend Tacy, whose real
		name is Anastasia, and then in the next
		book Betsy and Tacy become friends with
		Tib, whose real name, I am sorry to tell
		you, is Thelma.

	In another section of the store:

	George is showing Joe a first edition of Swiss Family
	Robinson from the glass case.

				GEORGE
		The illustrations are hand-tipped,
		which is why --

				JOE
		It costs so much.

				GEORGE
		It's why it's worth so much.

	Joe smiles and turns to see Kathleen and Annabel at a whole
	shelf of Betsy-Tacy books.

				ANNABEL
		I want all of them.

				KATHLEEN
		That might be an awful lot for your dad
		to buy at one time.

				ANNABEL
		My dad gets me all the books I want.

				KATHLEEN
			(looking over at Joe)
		Well, that's very nice of him.

				ANNABEL
		That's not my dad.  That's my nephew --

				KATHLEEN
		Oh, I don't really think that's your
		nephew --

	As Joe approaches.

				JOE
		It's true.  Annabel is my aunt.  Aren't
		you, Aunt Annabel?

	Annabel nods solemnly.

				ANNABEL
		And Matt is --

				KATHLEEN
		Let me guess.
			(to Matt)
		Are you his uncle?

				MATT
		No.

				KATHLEEN
		His grandfather?

	Annabel and Matt start giggling.

				KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		His great-grandfather?

				MATT
			(shouting with glee)
		I'm his brother.

				JOE
		Annabel is my grandfather's daughter.
		And Matt is my father's son.  We are an
		American family.

	He smiles at Kathleen, who finds herself smiling back.

	Annabel suddenly sneezes.

	Kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve.  It's an old
	fashioned hankie that's embroidered.  She offers it to
	Annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then
	looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled.

				ANNABEL
		What is that?

				KATHLEEN
		A handkerchief.  Oh my, do children not
		even know what handkerchiefs are?  A
		handkerchief is a Kleenex you don't throw
		away.  My mother embroidered it for me --
		you see?  My initials and a daisy, 
		because daisies are my favorite flower.

				ANNABEL
		Orchids are my favorite flower.

				KATHLEEN
			(to Joe)
		You know what else children don't know?
		They don't know what a telephone booth
		is?

	Joe is looking at Kathleen.

				JOE
		Who are you?

				KATHLEEN
		Kathleen Kelly.  I own this store.
		Are you are?

				JOE
		Joe.  Just call me Joe.
			(quickly)
		We'll take these books.

	He gets the one Matt is reading.  And the two other Kathleen
	has gotten for Annabel.

				KATHLEEN
		These are wonderful books.  As Annabel
		gets older the characters in the books do,
		too.
			(to Annabel)
		You can grow up with Betsy.

				GEORGE
		You're going to come back again, aren't
		you?

				JOE
		Of course.

				GEORGE
		This is why we're never going to go
		under.  Our customers are loyal.

				KATHLEEN
			(by way of explanation)
		They're opening a Foxbooks around the
		corner.

				ANNABEL
		Foxbooks!  My Daddy --

				JOE
			(gently putting his hand over
			 her mouth)
		-- likes to buy at discount.  Don't tell
		anyone that, Annabel, it's nothing to be
		proud of --

				MATT
			(spelling)
		F-O-X.

				KATHLEEN
		That's amazing.  You can spell fox.  Can
		you spell dog?

				MATT
		F-O-X.

			     JOE
		Matt, look at this dinosaur book.
		Wouldn't you like a dinosaur book?
		Annabel, maybe you could read this to
		Matt while I wrap things up here.
			(moves them to a corner, to
			 them quickly)
		Sit down, read, and don't listen to
		anything I say.

	Returns to counter and gives Kathleen some cash.

			     JOE
		And the dinosaur book too.

			     KATHLEEN
		The world is not driven by discounts,
		believe me.  I've been in business
		forever.  I started helping my mother
		here after school when I was six years
		old.  I used to watch her, and it wasn't
		that she was selling books, it was that
		she was helping people become whoever
		they were going to turn out to be.  When
		you read a book as a child it becomes
		part of your identity in a way that no
		other reading in your life does.
			(stops herself)
		I guess I've gotten carried away.

			     JOE
		You have, and you've made me feel...

	He can't finish the sentence.  He looks at her and sees,
	behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is
	unmistakably Kathleen's mother, with a young Kathleen.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Enchanting, your mother was enchanting.

			     KATHLEEN
		She was.  How did you know that?

			     JOE
		Lucky guess.

			     KATHLEEN
		Anyway.  She left the store to me, and
		I'm going to leave it to my daughter.

			     JOE
		How old is your daughter now?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, I'm not married.  But eventually.

	She smiles at Joe...

			     KATHLEEN
		So Foxbooks can...

			     KATHLEEN AND GEORGE TOGETHER
		Go to hell.

			     KATHLEEN
			(handing him his books)
		Here you go.

			     JOE
		We ready?

	Annabel and Matt join him at the counter.  Kathleen gives them
	each a lollipop.

			     ANNABEL
		Bye, Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Goodbye, Annabel.  Bye, Matt.  What
		about cat?  Can you spell cat?

			     MATT
		F-O-X.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Someplace like the auditorium at the Museum of Broadcasting.
	PATRICIA EDEN, Joe's girlfriend, who is the editor-in-chief
	of a New York publishing house called Eden Books, is standing
	at a podium at a sales conference.  In the audience are sales
	reps, wholesalers, etc.  There's a screen behind her with
	pictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		And now, the book you've all been waiting
		for, the book it's been my dreams to
		publish.  The legendary Veronica Grant
		has written her memoirs --

	There's a burst of applause as a photograph of Veronica Grant
	flashes on screen.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		-- and I'm happy to report it is just
		crammed with tragedy.
			(she laughs gaily)
		Just kidding, but seriously, it's all
		here: poverty, addiction, divorce,
		tracheotomies --

	We see pictures of Veronica at eight with her sharecropper
	family, Veronica at 14 with her first child, Veronica with a
	series of husbands, Veronica in a wheelchair, etc.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		-- her third husband beat her up, hip
		replacement, and an amazing face lift
		where all the injected fat fell to her
		chin.

	Now we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of
	Veronica on it and the title: "Am I Rising from Ashes, or Did
	I Just Forget to Dust?"

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		This book is fabulous.  And even if it
		weren't, it would sell like crazy,
		because Veronica is going to plug it to
		death on every talk show in America.
		This book...

	Patricia bursts into tears.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		I'm sorry.  I can't talk about it without
		crying.  Veronica and I have so much in
		common -- well, not all the sad parts --
		but we were both famous by the time we
		were 29 and, believe me, that's rough.
			(wipes her nose with a Kleenex,
			 pulling herself together)
		Anyway, I just want to say that I'm
		especially thrilled to be publishing it.
		Veronica lives in my building and we met
		in the elevator.  By the time we had
		traveled from the eighth floor to the
		first, we had a deal.  First printing:
		one million copies.

	Everyone applauds enthusiastically.

	INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - A SHORT WHILE LATER

	Patricia is leaving, still surrounded by colleagues and sales
	reps congratulating her.  She is the soul of graciousness.
	Her assistant, Sarah, comes up.

			     SARAH
			(quickly)
		You have a dentist appointment in twenty 
		minutes.  So you should leave soon...

			     PATRICIA
		What's my car number?

			     SARAH
		Car?  You didn't say anything about a car
		--

			     PATRICIA
		Are you an idiot?  Of course I need a car.
		God!

	She walks toward the exit.

	EXT. 57TH STREET - CONTINUOUS

	Patricia in the pouring rain, trying to hail a cab.  She
	spots one across the street.

			     PATRICIA
		Taxi!  Taxi!  Taxi!

	She whistles -- a longshoreman's whistle.

	The cab makes a U-turn, but instead of stopping for Patricia
	it stops about twenty feet ahead for a MAN in an overcoat who
	gets into it.

			     PATRICIA
		Excuse me -- what are you doing?  This is
		my taxicab.
			(to the driver)
		Don't take him.  I am telling you right
		now, and I am memorizing your number,
		don't take him.
			(to the man)
		Who the fuck do you think you are?

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Are you going uptown?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Get in.  I'll drop you.

	INT. TAXI - A MINUTE LATER

	As the cab turns onto Eighth Avenue, starts uptown.

	Patricia is dialing her cell phone.  She's elaborately
	ignoring the man who stole her cab.

			     PATRICIA
		Veronica, it's Patricia, you should have
		been there, it was unbelievable, we're
		going to sell truckloads of your book.
		Call me.

	She hangs up, folds up the phone, puts it back in her purse
	as the cab moves on.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Are you an editor?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		I am a rabbi.

			     PATRICIA
		Oh, my God, I said fuck to a rabbi.  I'm
		sorry.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		I hope you don't mind my asking, but are
		you Jewish?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		You should come to our temple.

			     PATRICIA
		I'm not really religious.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Oh, I am surprised, you seem like a very
		religious person.

			     PATRICIA
		You're kidding, right?

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		We are at West End Avenue and 83rd
		Street.  Every Friday night, we have a
		joyous time, everyone dancing, everyone
		singing.  Also some wisdom.  Perhaps you
		have heard of us, we are known as The
		Singles Temple.

	He smiles at her.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		It's a very good place to calm down.

	The cab stops.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Oh, look, I am already here.  Very nice
		to meet you.
			(gives the cabbie money)
		Take this woman to her destination.

	He gets out.  Closes the door.  A beat too late:

			     PATRICIA
		Goodbye.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Frank comes up the stoop.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Kathleen is dressed up for a party.

	Frank walks in, looks meaningfully at her.

			     FRANK
		I saw him.  I actually saw him.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     FRANK
		I can't believe it.  I saw William
		Spungeon.

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought he was in Mexico.

			     FRANK
		Maybe he's in Mexico, but today he was in
		New York.  The most brilliant and
		reclusive novelist in the history of the
		world is here, in this neighborhood.  He
		may be living on this very block.

			     KATHLEEN
		Where did you see him?

			     FRANK
		I was on the subway --

	INT. SUBWAY - DAY

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		-- and this musician got onto the train --

	Frank is sitting on the subway, reading the Village Voice.
	The door between the cars opens and a man playing the 
	clarinet enters the car.

	No one looks up except Frank.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		-- and I suddenly saw him, sitting
		directly across from me doing the
		crossword puzzle.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		How'd you know it was him?

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He looked exactly the same as his high
		school yearbook picture, which happens to
		be the last photograph ever taken of him.

	Frank takes out his billfold on the subway, pulls out a piece
	of paper.

	CLOSE UP - FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER

	As Frank unfolds a newspaper clipping of a yearbook picture
	of William Spungeon at 17.

	Frank compares the photo of Spungeon with the person sitting
	across the way.  They don't look remotely alike except that
	the boy in the picture and the man on the subway are both
	wearing the same style glasses.

	The subway stops at 79th Street, and William Spungeon gets off.
	Frank follows.

	EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Frank comes out of the subway station and looks around.

			     FRANK
		So I followed him.

	Frank sees Spungeon cross 79th.  He follows.

	EXT. H&H BAGELS - CONTINUOUS

	Frank follows Spungeon, who hurries into H&H Bagels passing a
	HOMELESS MAN holding a paper cup at the door.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He went into H&H and bought a bagel
		with everything.

	EXT. H&H BAGELS - A MINUTE LATER

	As Spungeon leaves the store, passing the paper cup, which we
	now realize that Frank, in dark glasses, is holding.

	Spungeon drops his newspaper in a garbage container.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He dropped his crossword into the 
		garbage and I rescued it.

	Frank plucks the puzzle from the trashcan, follows Spungeon.

	INT. SPORTING GOOD STORE - CONTINUOUS

	Spungeon at the counter in the shoe store.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		Then he went into a sporting good store
		and bought tube socks, 6 pair for $7.99.

	We see Frank, peeking out at him from behind a stack of
	running pants.  Suddenly he's distracted by a couple of
	joggers.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		William Spungeon and tube socks.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		I know.  I don't want to dwell on it.

	Frank looks back at the counter.  Spungeon's gone.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		And then I lost him.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

	Frank waves the crossword puzzle in front of Kathleen.

			     FRANK
		Do you know what this is worth?

	He takes an empty instant-frame from the closet, puts the
	puzzle into it and sets it next to the typewriters.

	INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As the two of them eat dinner.

			     FRANK
		What I was thinking as I was trailing him
		was that eventually I would have the
		courage to say hello to him, you know,
		not in a horrible, intrusive or slavering
		fan-slash-acolyte kind of way, but more
		like, "Hi."  "How ya doing?"  "Have you
		ever thought about trading up in the sock
		area?"  "Who knows, maybe he's read my
		work -- and then we'd become friends, and
		eventually I'd introduce him to you --
		you know how much he loves children's
		books, there's a whole long section in
		Relativity's Smile about The Wizard of Oz
		-- and then maybe he'd come out of hiding
		so he could help save the store.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you talking about?

			     FRANK
		From Foxbooks.  I mean, if things got
		tough, he could help rally support --

			     KATHLEEN
		It's never going to get to that.  The
		store is fine.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	As they walk along after dinner.

			     FRANK
		I don't even know why you would say that?

			     KATHLEEN
		Neither do I.  It just flew out of my
		mouth.

			     FRANK
		There's enough business for us all.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	As they go up in an elevator.

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, we're fine.

			     FRANK
		You're more than fine, you're absolutely
		fine.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're fine.

	The elevator opens onto:

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A publication party for an author named VINCE MANCINI.  A mix
	of book people, journalists and various other media folk.

			     FRANK
		Hey, Vince.  Congratulations.  You know
		Kathleen Kelly.

			     VINCE
		How are you?

			     FRANK
		Guess who I saw today on the subway?
		William Spungeon.

			     VINCE
		I thought he was in Mexico.

	They start chatting.

	Across the room, Joe is with Patricia, who is telling two
	other people the story of meeting the rabbi in the taxicab.
	Joe looks over and sees Kathleen.  He suddenly looks
	stricken.

	Shifts his position so Kathleen can't see his face, but
	sneaks a look.

			     PATRICIA
		Would you get me another drink, sweetie?
		I'm all out.
			(continues chattering)
		So then the rabbi says, "It's a very good
		place to calm down."  Isn't that
		hysterical?

	They all laugh.  Joe moves over to the bar.

			     JOE
		Absolut on the rocks.

	As he is waiting, Kathleen comes up next to him.

			     KATHLEEN
		A white wine, please.
			(very friendly)
		Oh, hello.

			     JOE
		Hi.

			     KATHLEEN
		Remember me, from the bookstore?

			     JOE
		Of course I remember you.

			     KATHLEEN
		How's your aunt?

			     JOE
		Good.  She's good.
			(gets his drink)
		I have to deliver this.  I have a very
		thirsty date.  She's part camel.

	Kathleen laughs.

			     KATHLEEN
		Joe.  It's Joe, isn't it?

			     JOE
		And you're Kathleen.

	Joe vanishes into the party.

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - A MINUTE LATER

			     VINCE
		I can't believe you were talking to Joe
		Fox.

			     KATHLEEN
		Joe Fox?  As in --

	She can't even finish the sentence.

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER

	Joe is standing at a table of food, his back to the room.

			     KATHLEEN
		Fox?  Your last name is Fox?

	Joe spins around, looks at her.

			     JOE
		F-O-X.

			     KATHLEEN
		God, I didn't realize.  I didn't know who
		you --
			(she trails off)

			     JOE
		-- were with.
			(quoting)
		"I didn't know who you were with."

			     KATHLEEN
		Excuse me?

			     JOE
		It's from the Godfather.  When the movie
		producer realizes that Tom Hagen is the
		emissary of Vito Corleone --
			(continued)

	Kathleen is staring at him.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		-- just before the horse's head ends up
		in his bed never mind --

			     KATHLEEN
		You were spying on me, weren't you?  You
		probably rented those children.

			     JOE
		Why would I spy on you?

			     KATHLEEN
		I am your competition.  Which you know
		perfectly well or you would not have put
		up that sign saying "Just around the
		Corner."

			     JOE
		The entrance to our store is around the
		corner.  There is no other way to say it.
		It's not the name of our store, it's
		where it is.  You don't own "around the
		corner."

			     KATHLEEN
		Next thing you'll be using twinkle
		lights.

			     JOE
		Twinkle lights?

			     KATHLEEN
		Little white Christmas lights that
		twinkle.  I use them in my window and on
		all my displays, as if you didn't notice.

			     JOE
		Look, the reason I came into your store
		is that I was spending the day with
		Annabel and Matt.  I like to buy them a
		present when I see them because I'm one
		of those guys who likes to buy his way
		into the hearts of children who are his
		relatives.  There was only one place to
		buy children's books in the neighborhood
		-- although that will not always be the
		case, and it was yours, and it is a
		charming little bookstore.  You probably
		sell $250,000 worth of book a year --

			     KATHLEEN
		How do you know that?

			     JOE
		I'm in the book business.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm in the book business --

			     JOE
		Oh, I see, and we're the Price Club.
		Only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive
		oil for $3.99 that won't even fit into
		your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap
		books.  Me a spy.
			(beat)
		Absolutely.  And I managed to get my hands
		on a secret printout of the sales figures
		of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet
		full of its own virtue that I was instantly
		compelled to rush over and check it out
		for fear it would drive me out of business 
		--

	Kathleen stares at him.  She's speechless.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		What?
			(off her look)
		What?

	Kathleen shakes her head.

	Frank turns up.

			     FRANK
		Hi.  I'm Frank Navasky --

			     JOE
		-- Joe Fox.

			     FRANK
		Joe Fox?  Inventor of the Superstore,
		enemy of the mid-list novel, destroyer of
		City Books -- tell me something:
		How do you sleep at night?

	Patricia joins them.

			     PATRICIA
		I use a wonderful over-the-counter drug,
		Ultrasom.  Don't take the whole thing,
		just half, and you will wake up without
		even that tiniest hangover.  You're Frank
		Navasky, aren't you?

			     FRANK
		Yes.

			     PATRICIA
		Your last piece in the Independent, the
		one about Anthony Powell, was brilliant.
		I'm Patricia Eden, Eden Books.  Joe, this
		man is the greatest living expert on
		Julius and Ethel Rosenberg --

			     JOE
		And this is Kathleen Kelly --

	Kathleen glares at him.

			     FRANK
		You liked my piece.  God, I'm flattered.
		You know you write these things and you
		think someone's going to mention them and
		then the whole week goes by and the phone
		doesn't ring, and you think Oh, God, I'm
		a fraud, a failure --

			     PATRICIA
		You know what's always fascinated me
		about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg is how
		old they looked when they were really
		just our age.

	Everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at
	Patricia, who smiles at them all.

			     PATRICIA
			(to Frank)
		I'm so happy to have finally met you.  We
		will talk.  Have you ever thought about
		doing a book?

			     FRANK
		Oh sure, it's passed through my head.
		Something really relevant for today like
		the Luddite movement in 19th century
		England.

	At the same time:

			     JOE
		Patricia --

			     KATHLEEN
		Frank --

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As Kathleen and Frank get into bed.

			     FRANK
		I really like Patricia Eden.  She's a
		very nice person.

	Kathleen doesn't respond.  Frank turns out the light.

			     FRANK
		She needs educating, that's all.

	A beat.

			     FRANK
		She's hopelessly driven by money and
		power, but there's a hope for anyone 
		who's that familiar with my work --

	On Kathleen, as she turns away from Frank and lies there,
	eyes open.

	INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As Joe and Patricia get into bed.  Brinkley is already on the
	bed.

			     PATRICIA
		I had no idea that Frank Navasky was so
		down-to-earth.

	Joe doesn't respond.  Patricia turns out the light.

			     PATRICIA
		You read his stuff, you think he's going
		to be so obscure and abstruse.

	A beat.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		He's always talking about Heidigger and
		Foucault and I have no idea what any of
		it's about, really.

	Joe gets up.  Brinkley follows.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		Where are you going?

			     JOE
		I'm not really tired.

	INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	Joe writes on his computer.  Brinkley on the floor next to him.

	And cut between Joe and his computer screen.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Do you ever feel you become the worst
		version of yourself?  That a Pandora's
		Box of all the secret hateful parts --

	And cut between screen and

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	As Kathleen reads the end of Joe's letter.

	Kathleen hits the Reply key and starts to type:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I know what you mean and I'm completely
		jealous.  What happens to me when I'm
		provoked is that I get tongue-tied.  My
		mind goes blank.  Then I spend all night
		tossing and turning trying to think of
		what I should have said.

	INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	As he replies:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could pass
		all my zingers to you and then I would
		never behave badly and you could behave
		badly all the time and we'd both be
		happy?  On the other hand, I must warn
		you that when you finally have the
		pleasure of saying the thing you mean to
		say at the moment you mean to say it,
		remorse inevitably follows.  Do you think
		we should meet?

	INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen stares at Joe's letter in her computer.

	She's frozen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Meet?  Omigod.

	She sits staring at the letter.  She has no idea what to do.

	EXT. 75TH STREET & COLUMBUS - DAY

	As the iron gates on all the stores start to open, just the
	way we saw them open in the opening sequence of the movie.
	The pharmacy.  The optician.  The cosmetics supply store.
	The video store.

	And now, finally, we see the new grate on the new Foxbooks
	Superstore start to open upwards.  This is the finest grate
	on Broadway, no question of it.  It's electric and almost
	soundless.  We see a sign saying, OPENING DAY.  35% OFF ON
	ALL BEST-SELLERS.

	People on the street notice the store.  One walks in...

	CAMERA follows him...

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	The inside is beautiful.  Gleaning staircase, a cafe,
	comfortable chairs to sit, a bank of cashiers, everyone
	decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the
	alligator should be, a rope for the checkout line, and seven
	cash registers with seven cashiers.  Of course, books, books,
	books, as far as the eye can see.

	MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SAME SCENE - LATER THAT DAY

	The store is jam-packed.  Joe with his father Nelson, his
	grandfather Schuyler, and Kevin, the store manager.

			     JOE
		No pickets, no demonstrations.

			     KEVIN
		The neighborhood loves us.

			     NELSON
		They're wondering where we've been all
		these years.  They're wondering how they
		ever did without it.

			     SCHUYLER
		It's a hit.

	They admire their own store, walk through the downstairs and
	start up the staircase to the second floor.

			     NELSON
		How's the children's book department?

			     JOE
		It's early yet.  School isn't out.  And
		there's that children's bookstore nearby
		--

			     SCHUYLER
		Cecilia's store --

			     JOE
		Her daughter's --

			     NELSON
		We'll crush it --

			     SCHUYLER
		She was enchanting.

	And as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children
	come up the stairs behind them.

	EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

	A little group of children dressed as Pilgrims walk down the
	street as Kathleen comes around the corner to buy her morning
	paper.  Joe is at the newsstand.  She turns and pretends to
	be staring at a wall until he finishes buying his paper and
	walks on.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I don't think it's a good idea for us
		to meet...

	INT. STARBUCKS - ANOTHER DAY

	Joe is putting sugar into his coffee at the sugar counter as
	Kathleen comes in.  He pretends he didn't see her.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		I love our relationship.  There's a lot
		going on in the day-to-dayness of my life
		and there's something magical...

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	We see Kathleen and George at the end of the day, counting
	the receipts.  Birdie is using a calculator to total them.
	Christina is shelving books.  There are Thanksgiving
	decorations -- cardboard turkeys and pilgrims, books on
	colonists like Myles Standish.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		... and thrilling about this island in
		cyberspace I have with you.  SO PLEASE
		DON'T ASK ME AGAIN.

			     BIRDIE
		About $1200 less than the same week last
		year.

			     KATHLEEN
		That could be a fluke, right?

	They look at each other.

			     BIRDIE
		Or not.

			     KATHLEEN
		Their store is new.  It's a novelty.  But
		it will all shake out.  Do you think I
		should put up more twinkle lights?

			     BIRDIE
		That's a lovely idea.

			     CHRISTINA
		What if we have to fold?  I'll never find
		another part time job and I won't be able
		to pay the rent and I'll have to move to
		Brooklyn.

			     GEORGE
		The joy of rent control.  Six room for
		$450 a month.

			     CHRISTINA
		We know.  You've told us a million times.
		I can't believe you're bringing it up at
		a time like this.  It's like bragging
		because you're tall.  Birdie never brags
		about her rent and she pays even less
		than you.

			     BIRDIE
		Ten rooms.  I just rattle around from one
		to the other.

			     KATHLEEN
		Hey, guys.  We are not going to fold.

	The door opens, and Meredith Carter, the woman George had
	swooned over in front of his building, walks in.

	George stares, frozen in place, as she walks up to him.

			     MEREDITH
		George Pappas?

			     GEORGE
			(I have died and gone to
			 heaven)
		Yes.

			     MEREDITH
			(flashing her badge)
		Detective Carter, 23rd precinct.  I'd
		like to ask you a few questions.

	Kathleen suddenly sees George, following Meredith out of the
	store.  He's in a complete daze.

			     KATHLEEN
		George?  Where are you going?

	He goes out the door.

	LAURA MARGULIES, a well-known children's book author, enters
	as George leaves.

			     LAURA
		Kathleen, are you surviving?

			     KATHLEEN
		Laura!  We're so excited about your new
		book.  When should we schedule your
		signing?

			     LAURA
		Oh, it's being published in January.
		Are you going to be in business in
		January?  I'm so worried.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're doing great, aren't we?

			     CHRISTINA
		Great.

			     BIRDIE
		No difference whatsoever.

			     LAURA
		Thank God.  Well, you know you can count
		on me.  For anything, support, rallies.
		Picket lines.  We can get the Times to
		write something.  Or that nut in the
		Independent --

			     KATHLEEN
		What nut in the Independent?

			     LAURA
		Frank Navasky.  This is just the sort of
		thing that would outrage him.

	She smiles brightly.

	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	George and Meredith are sitting in a booth.

			     MEREDITH
		Mr. Pappas, I'm investigating the murder
		of the woman found on the roof of your
		building.  Do you live alone there?

			     GEORGE
		Do I live alone?  Yes I do.  Do you live
		alone?

			     MEREDITH
		Yes.

	George takes her hand in his and looks at it as if it were
	the eighth wonder of the world.  He starts stroking it,
	caressing it...

	Meredith pulls it away.  A beat.  Then she gives it right
	back to him.  He continues stroking.  They stare at each
	other.  He puts her fingers into his mouth.

		MEREDITH
			(overwhelmed)
		What are you doing?

			     GEORGE
		I don't know.  I have no idea.

			     MEREDITH
		You have to stop.

			     GEORGE
		I can't.

	She utters a little moan.

	INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT - A SHORT WHILE LATER

	They come into the apartment.  She throws herself into his
	arms.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - DAY

	As Christina runs, desperately trying to make eye contact
	with men running in the opposite direction.  No one will look
	at her.

	INT. ZABAR'S CHEESE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

	The place is mobbed -- the usual crush the night before
	Thanksgiving.

	Kathleen, pushing a shopping cart, is trying to wedge her way
	through the crowd in the cheese department.  As she reaches
	across three people to grab some Brie, she sees Joe walk into
	the store.  Quickly, she turns her back so he can't see her.
	She stands there frozen.  A beat...

	Peeks around, doesn't see him anywhere.  Cranes her neck this
	way and that.  No Joe.

	INT. ZABAR'S CASHIER AREA - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen, now wearing dark glasses but looking not at all
	disguised, looks around and spots a short line and makes a
	beeline for it.

	At that moment, Joe comes from the Appetizing Department and
	gets on the line she was heading for.

	Panicked, Kathleen retreats onto another line and stands with
	her back to him.

	INT. SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

	The CASHIER totals up Kathleen's purchases and Kathleen hands
	over her credit card.

			     CASHIER
		This is a Cash Only line.

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     CASHIER
		Cash Only.

			     KATHLEEN
		Omigod, I only have a credit card.  Is
		that okay?

			     PERSON BEHIND HER IN LINE
		Of course it's not okay, there's a sign.

			     CASHIER
		There's a sign.

			     PERSON IN LINE
			(to the person behind her)
		She doesn't have cash.

	"She doesn't have cash" is repeated all the way down the
	line.

	Joe turns to see what's going on.

			     ANOTHER PERSON
		Get on another line, lady.

			     JOE
		Oh, hello.

			     KATHLEEN
		Hello.

			     JOE
		Do you need some money?

			     KATHLEEN
		No, I don't need any money.  Thank you
		very much.

			     CASHIER
		Get on another line.

			     JOE
		Hi.
			(off her nametag, big smile)
		Rose. Great name.  Rose, this is
		Kathleen, I'm Joe, and this is a credit
		card machine.  Happy Thanksgiving.

	Rose just stares at him.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Now it's your turn to say happy
		Thanksgiving back.

			     ROSE
		Happy Thanksgiving back.

	Joe looks at her, winks.

			     JOE
		Mississippi is a hard word to spell.  How
		do you spell it?  I-T.
			(big smile)
		Now take this credit card and put it
		through the machine, zip zip.

	The cashier, completely charmed, takes Kathleen's credit
	card.

	Kathleen is appalled.

	Everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly.

			     JOE
		So you're fine.

			     KATHLEEN
		Fine.

			     JOE
		Happy Thanksgiving.

	As Kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly
	starts to put her groceries into a bag.

	INT. JOE'S FATHER'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING DAY

	An elegant East Side apartment.  Schuyler, his youngish
	French wife, YVETTE, Nelson, Gillian and their child Matt,
	and Joe are sitting and listening as Annabel sings Tomorrow.

			     ANNABEL
		The sun'll come up tomorrow, bet your
		bottom dollar that tomorrow, there'll be
		sun --

	Joe is on a loveseat with Matt.  Gillian lifts Matt up, sits
	down in his place next to Joe and plunks Matt into her lap.
	Nelson is already seated in a chair in front of the loveseat
	and can't see her without turning around.

	As she continues singing, Gillian moves her hand next to
	Joe's leg.  Joe edges away.  He looks around the room, sees
	Nanny Maureen standing behind the couch.  He stands, offers
	her his seat.  She sits.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	A much more informal Thanksgiving dinner. We see the
	leftovers on a sideboard near a round table in Kathleen's
	living room.

	Kathleen, Frank, Birdie, Christina, George and George's new
	girlfriend, Meredith and TWO OTHER FRIENDS are standing
	around the upright piano.  Birdie is playing a Christmas
	song, and everyone is singing.

	As the singing continues, over, we cut to:

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DECEMBER DAY

	As the Christmas decorations and twinkle lights go into the
	window.

	Birdie walks by the store.  She stops to look at the
	customers inside, and then notices a sign in the window:

	"Book Signing January 10 - Best Selling Children's Author
	Laura Margulies."  There's a picture of Laura Margulies.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DECEMBER DUSK

	Kathleen is in the window decorating a little tree with
	lovely decorations from a box.  Two people are carrying a
	tree home, there's the sound of church bells.

	Kathleen looks up as a couple of people walk past the store,
	carrying Foxbooks shopping bags.

	Then she unwraps a pair of ruby slipper ornaments, and as she
	starts to hang them on the tree we hear the sound of the
	computer.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		This is such an odd Christmas.  I find
		myself missing my mother, who's been dead
		for ten years.  New York at Christmas is
		so loaded with all the things we used to
		do --

	INT. NEW YORK STATE THEATER - 1972 - DAY

	As Young Kathleen, dressed in a little velvet dress, sits in
	the audience next to her mother watching the ballet.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)
		-- going to the Nutcracker --

	EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - 1972 - DAY

			     KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)
		-- ice skating at Rockefeller Center,
		where I was knocked into a 6-year-old
		maniac --

	A SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY knocks into her.

			     YOUNG KATHLEEN
		Hey, watch out --

			     SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY
		Me watch out, why don't you watch out?
		I'm not sliding around like a baby.  You
		think I come here to skate with babies?

	Young Kathleen's jaw drops and she stands there tongue-tied.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My first experience as a speechless
		person.

	Her mother skates up and takes her hand.  The boy skates off.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I always miss my mother at Christmas, but
		somehow it's worse this year since I need
		some advice from her.

	And we hear the sound of another computer.

	INT. JOE'S DEN

	As he replies to Kathleen.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		My mother took me ice skating too --

	EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - DAY

	We see a little boy, YOUNG JOE, 8, skate past holding someone's
	hand --

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		-- although my mother did not skate.  The
		nanny skated --

	And we now see JOE'S NANNY, a young Sonja Henie, who suddenly
	peels off into a series of triple lutzes, as JOE'S MOTHER
	absently reads a copy of Vogue in the spectators' section.

	INT. LINCOLN CENTER THEATER - 1972 - DAY

			     JOE (V.O.)
		And I was in the Nutcracker.

	We see the stage now.  There's Young Joe, among the children
	at the Christmas party.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		So was my nanny.

	As JOE'S NANNY #2 pirouettes past.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Different nanny.  By the way, I'm
		surprised you aren't a writer.  Although
		you probably are a writer and don't
		know it.  Are you a writer and I don't 
		know it?

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - 1972 - NIGHT

	Young Joe, at the dinner table with his father.  A wide shot
	of a big room with a huge table and servants.  Joe looks very
	small at the table as he eats his soup.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		My mother died when I was ten.  I was
		staying with my father, who is not famous
		for intimacy, and whose way of breaking
		the news of her death was to tell me she
		would not be coming to pick me up as
		usual.  It was a car accident, and I
		don't know where she was going or who she
		was with, and I assume what I owe her is
		my tendency to cover almost any emotion
		with a joke.  A useful gift, unless you
		want to know what you're feeling.  She
		was very beautiful.  People toss that
		word around a lot, but my mother was.

	The camera moves closer to the dining table.  We see that
	tears are rolling down little Joe's cheeks.

	INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	Joe stops typing.  He is surprised to find his eyes watering.
	A moment of confusion as he cannot believe he has moved
	himself to tears.  Shakes his head, shakes the emotion off.
	Starts typing again.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Ancient history.  So what kind of advice
		do you need?  Can I help?

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen in bed with her laptop reading Joe's letter.

	She starts to type a response.

	Suddenly there's harp arpeggio and an Instant Message
	flashes on screen.

	From NY 152

	CLOSE ON KATHLEEN - TOTAL SHOCK

	ON SCREEN AS WE SEE THE MESSAGE

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I had a gut feeling you would be on line
		now.

	INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Joe is in bed with his laptop.  And cut back and forth
	between them and their computer screens as they type Instant
	Messages to one another.  Possible split screens.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		I can give you advice.  I'm great at
		advice.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I don't think you can help.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Is it about love?

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My business is in trouble.  My mother
		would have something wise to say.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm a brilliant businessman.  It's what
		I do best.  What's your business?

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		No specifics, remember?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Minus specifics, it's hard to help.
		Except to say, go to the mattresses.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		What?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		It's from The Godfather.  It means you
		have to go to war.

	CLOSE ON KATHLEEN - LOOKING AT THE COMPUTER

			     KATHLEEN
			(to herself)
		The Godfather?

	She starts to type.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		What is it with men and The Godfather?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		The Godfather is the I Ching.  The
		Godfather is the sum of all wisdom.  The
		Godfather is the answer to any question.
		What should I pack for my summer
		vacation?  "Leave the gun, take the
		cannoli."  What day of the week is it?
		"Maunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday."
		And the answer to your question is "Go to
		the mattresses."
			(continued)

	CAMERA ON KATHLEEN - CONSIDERING WHAT HE SAYS

			     JOE (cont'd)
		You're at war.  "It's not personal, it's
		business.  It's not personal it's
		business."  Recite that to yourself every
		time you feel you're losing your nerve.
		I know you worry about being brave, this
		is your chance.  Fight.  Fight to the
		death.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Patricia comes in as Joe is waiting for Kathleen's response.

			     PATRICIA
		Look what I bought.

	Joe types "Ciao" and signs off.  Looks up to see Patricia
	showing him a Plexiglas menorah.

			     PATRICIA
		I was just passing this store on Columbus
		Avenue and it caught my eye.

			     JOE
		What is it?

			     PATRICIA
		A Menorah.
			     JOE
		It doesn't look like a Menorah.

			     PATRICIA
		I know.  I don't know what came over me.
		I don't even celebrate Hanukkah.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	As Kathleen logs off, Frank comes in.

			     KATHLEEN
		Frank, I've decided to go to the
		mattresses.  Do you think it would be a
		gigantic conflict of interest if you
		wrote something about us?

	INT. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	It's January.  The store is more crowded than we've seen it.
	Frank is there with several copies of the Independent.  The
	phone is ringing off the hook.  Christina and George are
	fielding calls.  Birdie is reading Frank's article.

			     BIRDIE
			(reading)
		"Kathleen Kelly and her mother Cecilia
		Kelly have raised your children.  If this
		precious resource is killed by the cold
		cash cow of Foxbooks, it will not only be
		the end of Western civilization as we
		know it, but the end of something even
		dearer: our neighborhood as we know it.
		Save the Shop Around the Corner and you
		will save your own soul."  Frank, that's
		charming.

			     FRANK
		You think it's a little over the top?

			     BIRDIE
		Just say thank you.

			     FRANK
		Thank you.

			     CHRISTINA
			(calling to Kathleen)
		Channel 2's outside.

	INT. BACK ROOM - THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - SAME TIME

	Kathleen is primping in a tiny wall mirror.  She takes a deep
	breath.

			     KATHLEEN
		In a second.

			     GEORGE
			(from the other room)
		The Village Voice is coming.

			     KATHLEEN
		Omigod.

	Frank sticks his head in.

			     FRANK
			(in shock)
		It's him.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     FRANK
		God. It is God.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen comes out of the storage room.

	William Spungeon is standing there.

			     WILLIAM SPUNGEON
		I'm William Spungeon.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm very pleased to meet you.  I'm
		Kathleen Kelly.

	Frank is practically levitating.

			     SPUNGEON
		I knew your mother.  Although she knew me
		only as W.  That enormous bookstore is
		obscene.

			     FRANK
		I'm Frank Navasky.  I carry your picture
		in my wallet.

	He pulls it out.  Spungeon looks at him like he's crazy.

			     KATHLEEN
		We've organized pickets.  Channel 13 is
		doing a special.

			     SPUNGEON
		I'd be glad to talk to the press if it's
		all right with you.  They've been trying
		to interview me for years.

			     FRANK
		The press?  I'm the press.

			     KATHLEEN
		You'd allow that?  For me?  For the
		store?  That's incredible.  Although you
		wouldn't have to be photographed.  I
		respect that.  If it's television, they
		could just put one of those blurry dots
		in front of your face.

			     SPUNGEON
		No television.

			     CHRISTINA
			(referring to the TV crew)
		They're waiting for you --

			     FRANK
		I know all your books.  Phaelox the
		gnome, the little man who comes from
		nowhere... and is going nowhere...
			(quoting)
		"Where did you come from?"  "Nowhere."
		"Where are you going?"  "Nowhere."

			     SPUNGEON
		Cool it.  I'm starting to break out in
		hives.
			(to Kathleen)
		Here's my phone number.

			     KATHLEEN
		I had no idea William Spugeon had a
		phone.

			     SPUNGEON
		Adios.

	He gives a little wave and leaves.

			     FRANK
		This is historic.
			(beat)
		Do you realize what I've done?  By
		writing that piece, do you realize?
		I've brought William Spungeon in from
		the cold. Holy shit.  I am completely
		amazing.

	At that moment a TV REPORTER sticks her head into the store.

			     TV REPORTER
		Kathleen Kelly?

	Kathleen takes a deep breath, walks out the door.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		Are you ready, Miss Kelly?

			     KATHLEEN
		Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		What?

			     KATHLEEN
		Never mind.  I'm ready.  Shoot.

	INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - THAT NIGHT

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		We're here in front of the Shop Around
		the Corner, the famous West Side
		children's bookstore now on the verge of
		having to close its doors because the big
		bad wolf, Foxbooks, has opened only a few
		hundred feet away, wooing customers with
		its sharp discounts and designer coffee.

			     KATHLEEN
		They have to have discounts and lattes,
		because most of the people who work there
		have never read a book.

	And pull back now to reveal that we're in:

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	Five TV sets are on, over adjoining treadmills, Joe and
	Kevin are on two of the treadmills, walking and watching.

			     JOE
		She's not as nice as she seems on
		television.

			     KEVIN
		You've met her?

			     JOE
		She's kind of a pill.

			     KEVIN
		She's probably not as attractive as she
		seems on television either.

			     JOE
		No, she's beautiful.  But a pill.

			     KEVIN
		So you don't feel bad about basically
		destroying her livelihood not to mention
		her legacy not to mention her raison
		d'etre.

			     JOE
		It's not personal --

			     KEVIN
		It's business.

			     JOE
		Right.  Exactly.

	They look up at the television.

	INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - CONTINUOUS

	Joe onscreen, with a super: Joe Fox, Vice-President Foxbooks.

			     JOE
		I sell cheap books.  Sue me.  I sell
		cheap books, and as a result -- listen 
		to this, because it's really bad --
		more people can buy books.

	The show immediately cuts back to the newscaster.

	On Joe and Kevin.

			     KEVIN
		That's what you said?

			     JOE
			(outraged)
		That's not all I said.  I said -- I can't
		believe those bastards -- I said we were
		great, I said people can come and sit and
		read for hours and no one bothers them, I
		said we stock 150,000 titles, I showed
		them the New York City section.  I said
		we were a goddamn piazza where people
		could mingle and mix and be.

			     KEVIN
		A piazza?

			     JOE
		I was eloquent.  Shit.  It's just
		inevitable, isn't it?  People are going
		to want to turn her into Joan of Arc --

			     KEVIN
		-- and you into Attila the Hun.

			     JOE
		Well it's not me personally, it's more
		like it's the company --

			     KATHLEEN
			(on the television)
		And I have to say, I have met Joe Fox,
		who owns Foxbooks, and I have heard him
		compared his store to a Price Club and the
		books in it to cans of olive oil.

	On Joe, reacting.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	A small rally is taking place, with picket signs.  Kathleen
	is standing on a small speaker's platform, along with the
	Borough President.

			     KATHLEEN
		My mother used to say to me that every
		book you sell is a gift from the
		heart...

	EXT. FOXBOOKS - DAY

	As 20 CHILDREN march in front of the store, holding little
	makeshift picket signs and singing songs.  "One, two, three,
	four, we don't want this Superstore."

	Customers go right through the line and into the store.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	We can hear the pickets marching and singing outside --
	although the store is full of customers anyway.  The Fox men
	-- Joe, Nelson and Schuyler -- are sitting in the cafe.
	Nelson is holding a copy of a weekly newspaper, which has the
	old high-school yearbook picture of William Spungeon on the
	front page and a headline: William Spungeon Emerges from
	Hiding to Support Bookstore.

			     SCHUYLER
		Who is this Spungeon anyway?

			     JOE
		He's a writer.

			     NELSON
		Well, I've never heard of him.  And
		neither has anyone else in this place.

	INT. TV SET - NIGHT

	As we see SIDNEY-ANN STRONGIN, a young and attractive PBS
	talk show hostess for a show called Inside Media.

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		The New York Literary world was shocked
		this week when William Spungeon, the most
		famously reclusive author since J.D.
		Salinger, announced that he was coming
		out of hiding because of his loyalty to a
		small children's bookstore on the West
		Side of Manhattan.  Discussing this
		tonight is a man I happen to think of as
		one of this city's most underappreciated
		assets, Frank Navasky.

			     FRANK
		Thank you.

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		This all happened because of you, didn't
		it --

			     FRANK
		Well, I knew William Spungeon loved
		children's books so I wrote a provocative
		column --

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		Your specialty.

	Frank laughs.  Sidney-Ann laughs.

			     FRANK
		And it kind of smoked him out.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As she and Frank watch the television show.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Technologically speaking, the world's 
		out of hand.  Take the VCR.  The whole
		idea of a VCR is that it makes it possible
		for you to tape what's on television
		while you're out of the house.  But the
		whole point of being out of the house is
		so you can miss what's on television.
		Radio.  Now there's a medium I can get
		behind.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Well, we're on television... and you're
		good at it.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Thank you.

	Another little moment between them.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		The bookstore.  Tell us about it.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Are you planning to collect radios?

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Do you think I should?

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		The Shop Around the Corner is a true New
		York treasure.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		As are you.  I'd love to have you back.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Any time.  Are we done?

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Not at all.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Because I just want to say that the only
		show I do watch is yours.

			     KATHLEEN
			(appalled)
		Omigod.

			     FRANK
		Hey, I was just being polite.  Okay, I
		admit, I slobbered all over her.

	The show continues.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	As we see Kathleen flip the open sign to closed.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	George is talking to Kathleen and Birdie, who is toting up
	the week's receipts.

			     GEORGE
		And I can't decide whether to put
		sausages into the meat sauce or just
		chopped meat.  Last time I made it,
		Detective Carter and I never even sat
		down to dinner because --
			(he makes some sort of hand
			 gesture indicating that sex
			 prevented them from dining)
		and last night, I made margaritas in the
		blender, and I took the ice cube and --

			     BIRDIE
		Spare us.

	George goes out the door.

	Birdie looks at Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't tell me.  Not the slightest
		difference?

	Birdie can't bring herself to answer.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		How could that be?  All this publicity
		and not one bit of difference?
		Oh Birdie, what am I going to do?  What
		would Mom have done?

			     BIRDIE
		Let's ask her.

	She opens the locket hanging around her neck.  There's a
	picture of Kathleen's mother inside it.  Birdie holds the
	locket up to her face.

			     BIRDIE
		Cecilia, what should we do?

	Birdie holds the locket to her ear and listens.  A pause.

			     KATHLEEN
		Birdie?

			     BIRDIE
		Shhhh.
			(after a beat, shrugs)
		She has no idea, but she thinks the
		window display is lovely.  Good night
		dearie.

	Birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag, goes out the
	door.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT

	It's starting to rain.  Kathleen lowers the grate over the
	store.  As she turns to walk away, William Spungeon steps in
	her path out of the shadows.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh my goodness, hello.  What are you
		doing here.

			     SPUNGEON
		Loitering.  Lurking.  Skulking.
		Stalking.

	He laughs.  So does she.  Dramatically, he whips out an
	umbrella and opens it over the two of them.

			     SPUNGEON (cont'd)
		You look very beautiful.

			     KATHLEEN
		Thank you.  But I'm a wreck.

	He touches her cheek suddenly.  Kathleen starts.  Then he
	blows on his hand.

			     SPUNGEON
		An eyelash.  It's gone.

	Kathleen relaxes.  They start walking.

			     KATHLEEN
		Are you writing another book?

			     SPUNGEON
		I'm in the home stretch.  I'll be done in
		approximately six more years.

			     KATHLEEN
		Should I discount?

			     SPUNGEON
		It's about a man on a quest for knowledge
		who meets a woman he cannot resist.

			     KATHLEEN
		If I discount I have to fire someone
		because I can't discount with this
		overhead but whom could I fire?  I
		couldn't fire anyone.

	Spungeon suddenly puts his hand through Kathleen's hair.  She
	stops, frozen in place.

			     SPUNGEON
		You have your mother's hair.  Thick,
		wild, the color of Nebraska wheat.

	He grabs her and tries to kiss her.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you doing?  Let me go.

	He backs her into a wall.

			     KATHLEEN
		Stop it.  Are you crazy?

	She kicks him in the shins, wiggles free and runs away.

			     SPUNGEON
			(calling after her)
		If you change your mind, you can E-mail
		me.  Hermit@AOL.com.

	EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Rain is falling.

	We hear the sound of the computer.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		"Where?  When?"

	INT. NUT SHOP OF BROADWAY - DAY

	George, Kathleen and Christina in the shop.  Kathleen is
	buying more lollipops.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're meeting in a public place.

			     CHRISTINA
		Well don't go anywhere with him.  Don't
		even go out to the street with him
		afterwards.  Get a dial cab to just sit
		there and wait for you.

			     GEORGE
		Did you tell Frank?

			     KATHLEEN
		There's nothing to tell.

			     CHRISTINA
		But did you tell him?

			     KATHLEEN
		He's away.  At the 32nd anniversary of
		the Chicago Seven trial.

			     GEORGE
		And he's gone to a place where there are
		no phones.  Do you even know this guy's
		name?

	Kathleen shakes her head no.

			     CHRISTINA
		And you're going to meet him in a bar?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not a bar.  That place on 83rd with the
		cheesecake.

			     GEORGE
		And he will wear a flower in his lapel,
		and you will be carrying a copy of Anna
		Karenina with a rose in it.

	No answer.

			     CHRISTINA
		Oh God, no.

			     KATHLEEN
		Not Anna Karenina.  Pride and Prejudice.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS - NIGHT

	As Joe and Kevin walk out of the store and start downtown.

			     KEVIN
		I suppose she's carrying a copy of a book
		with a flower in it.

	Joe doesn't say anything.

			     KEVIN
		Not really.

			     JOE
		Really.

			     KEVIN
		Which Jane Austen is it?

			     JOE
		Pride and Prejudice.

			     KEVIN
		She could be a real dog.

			     JOE
		I know.  Look, I'll just stay ten
		minutes.  I'll say hello.  Drink a cup of
		coffee and split.  I'm outta here.

	He looks at Kevin.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Walk me there, okay?

	EXT. 83RD STREET - NIGHT

	As the two men walk toward Cafe Lalo, the European cafe on
	West 83rd Street.

			     JOE
		What if she has a really high, squeaky
		voice?  I hate that.  It reminds me of
		those mice in Cinderella.

			     KEVIN
		What mice in Cinderella?

			     JOE
		Gus-gus and oh shit, I can't remember the
		other one.  Why am I compelled to meet
		her?  I'm just ruining a good thing.

			     KEVIN
		You're taking it to the next level.  I
		always do that.  I always take a
		relationship to the next level, and if it
		works okay I take it to the next level
		after that, until I can finally get to
		the level where it becomes absolutely
		necessary for me to leave.

			     JOE
		I'm not going to stay long anyway.  I
		already said that, didn't I.  Christ.
		I'm a total wreck.

	As they reach:

	EXT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

	Joe stops and looks at Kevin.

			     JOE
		Kevin, this woman is the most adorable
		creature I have ever come in contact
		with.  If she turns out to be even as
		good-looking as a mailbox, I will be
		crazy not to turn my life upside down
		and marry her.

			     KEVIN
		She could be a real dog.

			     JOE
			(a total panic)
		You go look.

			     KEVIN
		Me?

			     JOE
		Just go to the window and check her out.

			     KEVIN
		You're pathetic.

	Kevin goes to the window and looks inside.

	EXT. CAFE LALO - NIGHT

	Joe and Kevin in front.

	Kevin looks in the window.

			     JOE
		See her?

			     KEVIN
		There's a beautiful, whoa, a very
		beautiful girl.

			     JOE
		Yes.

			     KEVIN
		But no book.  Let me see, let me see...
		Wait a minute.  There's a book with a
		flower, so it must be her.

			     JOE
		What does he look like?

			     KEVIN
		There's a waiter blocking, I can't see
		her face.  He's serving her a cup of tea
		and she's putting in three spoonfuls of
		sugar --

			     JOE
		Well, why shouldn't she?

			     KEVIN
		No reason.  Unless she has hypoglycemia.
		Oh, he's moving.

			     JOE
		Can you see her?

			     KEVIN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		And? --

			     KEVIN
			(clearly frustrated)
		She's very pretty.

			     JOE
		She is.  I knew she would be.  She had
		to be.

			     KEVIN
		She looks... I would say she has a little
		of the coloring of that Kathleen Kelly
		person.

			     JOE
		Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore.

			     KEVIN
		Why not?  You said you thought she was
		attractive.

			     JOE
		So what?  Who cares about Kathleen Kelly?

			     KEVIN
		Well, if you don't like Kathleen Kelly,
		I can tell you right now you ain't gonna
		like this girl.

			     JOE
		Why not?

			     KEVIN
		Because it is Kathleen Kelly.

	Joe elbows Kevin aside and looks.

			     JOE
		Oh, God.

	A long beat.

			     KEVIN
		What are you going to do?

			     JOE
		Nothing.

			     KEVIN
		You're going to let her just wait there?

			     JOE
		Yes.  Yes I am.  That's exactly what I'm
		going to do.  Why not?

			     KEVIN
		But she wrote the letters.

			     JOE
		Good night, Kevin.  I'll see you
		tomorrow.

	He walks away, leaving Kevin.

	Kevin stares after him.  Then he walks away in the other
	direction.

	INT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her
	tea.  She's starting to feel a little foolish.  She checks
	her watch.

	A loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next
	to hers.  They're laughing.  A man from the group grabs the
	empty chair at Kathleen's table.

			     MAN
		Do you mind?

	Kathleen jumps up.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, yes.  I'm expecting someone.
		Please.

	She takes the chair back.  Sits down again.  She watches the
	group as they playfully fight over the menus.

	She checks her watch again.  Then she opens her copy of Pride
	and Prejudice and looks at it.  She can't focus.

	A man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at
	him.  But he's going to meet another group of people.

	As he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower
	onto the floor.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh!

	She jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were
	precious china.

	In the window, now, behind her, Joe appears.  He watches, as
	she rearranges the book and the flower.

	He disappears from sight.

	A beat...

	He walks in the door.

			     JOE
		Kathleen Kelly.  Hello.  What a
		coincidence.  Mind if I sit down?

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes I do.  I'm expecting someone.

	Joe picks up her book, looks at it.

			     JOE
		Pride and Prejudice.

	Kathleen grabs it back.

			     KATHLEEN
		Do you mind?

	She places it back on the table, puts the rose into it.

			     JOE
		I didn't know you were a Jane Austen
		fan.  Not that it's a surprise.  I bet
		you read it every year.  I bet you just
		love Mr. Darcy, and that your sentimental
		heart beats wildly at the thought that he
		and whatever her name is are really,
		honestly and truly going to end up
		together.

			     KATHLEEN
		Would you please leave?

	Joe sits down.

			     KATHLEEN
		Please?

			     JOE
		I'll get up as soon as your friend comes.
		Is he late?

			     KATHLEEN
		The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is
		Elizabeth Bennet and she's one of the
		greatest, most complex characters ever
		written, not that you would know.

			     JOE
		As a matter of fact I've read it.

			     KATHLEEN
		Well, good for you.

			     JOE
		I think you'd discover a lot of things if
		you really knew me.

			     KATHLEEN
		If I really knew you, I know what I would
		find -- instead of a brain, a cash
		register, instead of a heart, a bottom
		line.

	Kathleen is shocked at herself.

			     JOE
		What is it?

			     KATHLEEN
		I just had a breakthrough, and I have to
		thank you for it.  For the first time in
		my life, when confronted with a horrible,
		insensitive person I actually knew what I
		wanted to say and I said it.

			     JOE
		I think you have a gift for it.  It was a
		splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.


			     KATHLEEN
		Meanness?  Let me tell you --

			     JOE
		Don't misunderstand me, I'm just paying
		you a compliment.

	He lifts the book off the table.  Kathleen grabs for it.

			     KATHLEEN
		Why are you doing this?

	She manages to get the book, leaving Joe with the rose.

			     JOE
		What have we have?  A red, no, crimson
		rose, tucked into the pages.  Something
		you read about in a book, no doubt.  One
		of those books with a lady in a nightgown
		on the cover about to throw herself off a
		cliff.

	She holds her hand out for it.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Give it to me.

	Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.

			     JOE
		It's a joke to you, isn't it?
		Everything's a joke to you.

	She grabs the rose.  Puts it back in the book.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Please leave.  I beg you.

	He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very
	next table, with his back to her.

	The door to the restaurant opens.  Kathleen looks at it
	hopefully.  A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined
	by a pleasant looking woman.

	For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the
	wind has just gone out of her sails.  She takes out her
	compact, looks into her mirror.  She slides it over to look
	behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her.  He
	turns away suddenly.

	Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.

			     JOE
		You know what the handkerchief reminds
		me of?  The first day I met you --

			     KATHLEEN
		The first day you lied to me --

			     JOE
		I didn't lie to you --

			     KATHLEEN
		You did too --

			     JOE
		I did not --

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought all that Fox stuff was so
		charming.  F-O-X.

			     JOE
		I never lied about it --

			     KATHLEEN
		"Joe.  Just call me Joe."  As if you were
		one of those stupid 22-year-old girls
		with no last name.  "Hi, I'm Kimberley."
		"Hi, I'm Janice."  What's wrong with
		them?  Don't they know you're supposed to
		have last names?  It's like they're a
		whole generation of cocktail waitresses.

	She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off
	on.  But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her
	table.

			     JOE
		I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --

			     KATHLEEN
		That's not what I meant --

			     JOE
		And when I said the thing about the Price
		Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't
		what I meant either --

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire.  I
		feel so sorry for you.

	The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTITE
	in a boa comes in the door.

			     JOE
		I am going to take a wild guess that this
		isn't him, either.  Who is he, I wonder.
		Not, I gather, the world's greatest
		living expert on Julius and Ethel
		Rosenberg, but someone else entirely.
		Will you be you be mean to him too?  Will
		you start out sweet as sugar candy and
		then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt
		from the blue, find that sharp little 
		tongue of yours?

			     KATHLEEN
		No, I won't.  Because the man who's
		coming here tonight is completely unlike
		you.  The man who is coming here is kind
		and funny -- he has the most wonderful
		sense of humor --

			     JOE
		But he's not here.

			     KATHLEEN
		If he's not here, he has a reason,
		because there is not a cruel or careless
		bone in his body.  I can't expect you to
		know anything about a person like that.
		You've nothing but a suit.

	A beat.  Joe gets up.

			     JOE
		That is my cue.  Good night.

	Joe leaves.

	THE COMPUTER SCREEN - NO MAIL

	Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face.

	She takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her
	face and blows her nose.  Then looks at her handkerchief and
	tosses it over her shoulder.

	She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of
	her shoes.

	Then she lies down on the bed, fully clothed.  She reaches
	up to turn out the light.

	On Joe's face, barely bearing.

		What happened?

			     KATHLEEN
		He wasn't able to make it.

			     GEORGE
		He stood you up.

			     KATHLEEN
		What could have happened?

	George looks suddenly stricken.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Why didn't he come?  Maybe he showed up,
		took one look at me and left.

			     CHRISTINA
		Not possible.

			     KATHLEEN
		Maybe there was a subway accident.

			     CHRISTINA
		Absolutely.

			     KATHLEEN
		A train was trapped underground with him
		inside.

			     CHRISTINA
		And no phone.

	George continues to look stricken.  He's starting to shake
	his head.

		Or an automobile accident.  Those cab
		drivers are maniacs.

			     CHRISTINA
		They hit something and you slam right
		into that plastic partition.

			     KATHLEEN
		His elbows could be in splints -- so he
		can't really dial --

			     CHRISTINA
		Or he could be in the hospital in one of
		those semi-private room with like --
			     
			     CHRISTINA & KATHLEEN
			(together)
		-- no phone.

	They look at George.  Still shaking his head.

			     KATHLEEN
			(to George)
		What?

	George hands them a New York Post.  They look at the cover:
	COPS NAB ROOFTOP KILLER

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you saying?

			     GEORGE
		It could be.

	Dead silence.

			     GEORGE (cont'd)
		He was arrested two blocks from the
		cheesecake place.

			     CHRISTINA
		Is there a picture?

	There it is.  It's of a man with his jacket pulled over his
	head.

	They all look at it.

			     CHRISTINA
		So that explains it.

			     GEORGE
		He was in jail.

			     CHRISTINA
		And there was a phone --

			     GEORGE
		-- but he got only one call and he had to
		use it to call his lawyer.

			     CHRISTINA
		You are so lucky.

			     GEORGE
		You could be dead.

			     KATHLEEN
		Are you crazy?  This man couldn't
		possibly be the rooftop killer.

			     CHRISTINA
		Remember when you thought Frank might be
		the Unabomber?

			     KATHLEEN
		That was different.

			     CHRISTINA
		How long did you sit there all alone?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not that long.  Joe Fox came in --

			     CHRISTINA
		Joe Fox!

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't want to talk about it.
			(closes her eyes)
		Let's get to work.

	They look around.  There's no one in the store and nothing to
	do.

	A pause.

			     KATHLEEN
		There must be something to do.  There's
		always something to do.

	They hear the jingle of the front door.  They look hopefully
	toward it.  It's only Birdie.

			     CHRISTINA
		He stood her up.

	Hold on Kathleen as the computer sound begins.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I have been thinking about you.  Last
		night I went to meet you and you weren't
		there.  I wish I knew why.  I felt so
		foolish.
			(continued)

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she types.  And we cut from her face to the screen as we
	hear a voice-over:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		And as I waited, someone else showed up,
		a man who has made my professional life a
		misery, and an amazing thing happened --
		I was able, for the first time in my
		life, to say the exact thing I wanted to say
		it.  And of course, afterwards, I felt
		terrible.  Just as you said I would.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER

	The E-mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I was cruel, and I'm never cruel.  And
		even though I can hardly believe what I
		said mattered to this man -- to him, I'm
		just a bug to be crushed -- but what if
		it did?  No matter what he's done to me,
		there's no excuse for my behavior.
		Anyway, you are my dear friend, and I so
		wanted to talk to you.  I hope you have a
		good reason for not being there last
		night, but if you don't, and if we never
		really connect again, I just want to tell
		you how much it has meant to me to know
		you were there.

	Joe sits there a second.  A moment of intense ambivalence.
	Then he hits the Menu key and signs off.

			     COMPUTER
		Goodbye.

	Joe stands and leaves the room.

	The computer sits there.

	Hold on the computer.  We hear him open the refrigerator 
	door. We hear him close the refrigerator door.  He passes
	the den without even looking into it.  A moment later he
	comes back into the room, stares at the computer.  He starts
	for the bedroom, changes his mind.  Circles the computer.
	He's going to go cold turkey if it kills him.

	Fuck it.  He sits down.  Sign on.  Starts to type.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I am in Vancouver.

	He stops... Hits the delete button and erases the message.
	He starts typing again:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I was stuck in a meeting, which I
		couldn't get out of it, and there was
		no phone.

	He backspaces to erase "there was no phone."

	Screen now reads: I was stuck in a meeting, which I couldn't
	get out of it.  Joe sits there thinking for a moment.  Then he
	starts typing.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		The electricity went out in the building
		and we were trapped on the 18th floor and
		the telephone system blew too.

	He stops and looks at it.  Then he types:

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Amazingly enough.

	He sits looking at it.

	Then he deletes the whole thing.

	Sits looking at the blank screen.

			     JOE
		Fuck you.

	He clicks the Yes box.

	Then he starts to type again.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Dear friend: I cannot tell you what
		happened to me last night, but I beg you
		from the bottom of my heart to forgive me
		for not being there.

	He deletes "for not being there."

	Then types again, after "to forgive me".

			     JOE (V.O.)
		-- for what happened.  I feel terrible
		that you found yourself in a situation
		that caused you additional pain.  But I'm
		absolutely sure that whatever you said
		last night was provoked, even deserved.
		And everyone says things they regret when
		they're worried or stressed.  You were
		expecting to see someone you trusted and
		met the enemy instead.  The fault is
		mine.
			(continued)

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As Kathleen and Christina walk down the street together.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Someday I'll explain everything.
		Meanwhile, I'm still here.  Talk to me.

			     CHRISTINA
		Did he say anything about meeting again?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not really.  It doesn't matter.  We'll
		just be like George Bernard Shaw and Mrs.
		Patrick Campbell and write letters our
		whole lives --

	They go into an apartment building.

	INT. BIRDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A large rent-controlled West Side apartment.  Birdie is 
	pouring tea.  There's a plate of cookies.

	Christina is looking at the picture of Birdie as a young
	woman, dressed in a sort of Carmen Miranda getup.

			     CHRISTINA
		Where was this taken, Birdie?

			     BIRDIE
		Seville.

			     KATHLEEN
		When you had the thunderbolt?

			     BIRDIE
		Yes.  What did you decide, dearie?

			     KATHLEEN
		Close.  We're going to close.

			     CHRISTINA
		Close.

			     KATHLEEN
		Although it feels like such a failure.
		It feels like I'm quitting.  It feels
		like... Mom...

	She closes her eyes.

	Birdie sits down on the loveseat next to Kathleen, puts her
	arms around her.  Hold on them.

			     BIRDIE
		Keeping the store open doesn't keep your
		mother alive, although sometimes I think
		we all think it does.

	Christina looks over at the picture of Birdie.

			     CHRISTINA
		Who was it, Birdie?  That you had the
		thunderbolt over?

	Birdie shakes her head.  She's not going to tell them.

			     CHRISTINA (cont'd)
		It's so romantic.

			     BIRDIE
		But it wasn't meant to be.

			     CHRISTINA
		Why not?

			     BIRDIE
		He ran Spain.

			     CHRISTINA
		Spain?

			     BIRDIE
		The country.  He ran it.  That was his
		job.  And then he died.  Just as well.

	INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE - NIGHT

	As Frank and Kathleen go up the escalator, on their way to a 
	movie.

			     FRANK
		She fell in love with Generalissimo
		Franco?

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't say that.  We don't know that for
		sure.

			     FRANK
		Who else could it have been?  It was
		probably around 1960 --

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, it's not like he was something
		normal, like a socialist or an anarchist
		or something --

			     FRANK
		It happened in Spain.  People do really
		stupid things in foreign countries.

			     KATHLEEN
		Absolutely.  They buy leather jackets,
		they go see Flamenco, they ride in
		gondolas, they eat in restaurants where
		guitarists sing Malaguena sola Rosa, but
		they don't fall in love with fascist
		dictators.

	They enters one of the theatres.

	INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS

	As they find seats and sit down.  A trailer is playing.

			     KATHLEEN
		Birdie is a very kind person, she's
		practically my surrogate mother.

			     FRANK
		Well she's out of her mind.

			     KATHLEEN
		She is not.

			     FRANK
		I could never ever be with anyone who
		doesn't take politics as seriously as I
		do.

	The person in front of them turns around.

			     PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM
		Do you mind?

			     FRANK
		A hot dog is singing.  You need quiet
		while a hot dog is singing?

	The two of them sit there.

			     KATHLEEN
		I have something to tell you.  I didn't
		vote.

			     FRANK
		What?

			     KATHLEEN
		In the last mayoral election, when Rudy
		Giuliani was running against Ruth
		Messinger, I went to get a manicure and
		forgot to vote.

			     FRANK
		Since when do you get manicures?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, I suppose you could never be with a
		woman who gets manicures.

			     FRANK
		Forget it.  It's okay.  I forgive you.

			     PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM
		Shhhhhh.

			     KATHLEEN
		You forgive me.

	Hold on them a beat.

	Kathleen stands and walks out of the theatre.

	INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE ESCALATOR - NIGHT

	Kathleen on the down escalator.  Frank scrambling to catch up
	with her.

			     FRANK
		What's going on?

	Kathleen's upset.

			     FRANK (cont'd)
		Hey.  What is it?

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	As they walk uptown.

			     FRANK
		Look, this has been a big week, you're
		closing the store --

			     KATHLEEN
		It's not that, Frank, really it's not.
		It's just... Frank...

			     FRANK
		I know, that was terrible of me.

			     KATHLEEN
		What was?

			     FRANK
		To jump all over you when I'm the one
		who's really...  Oh, God, I don't know
		how to say this --

			     KATHLEEN
		What is it?

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	As we see Kathleen and Frank being served drinks in a glassed-
	in extension of a restaurant.

	INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As Kathleen looks at Frank, waiting for him to begin.

			     FRANK
		You're a wonderful person, Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		So are you.

			     FRANK
		And I'm honored that you want to be with
		me because you would never be with anyone
		who wasn't truly worthy --

			     KATHLEEN
		I feel exactly the same way about you.

			     FRANK
		Oh, God, don't say that, please, that
		just makes it worse.

			     KATHLEEN
		What?
			(he shakes his head)
		You don't love me?

	Frank shakes his head no.

			     KATHLEEN
		Me either.

			     FRANK
		You don't love me?

	Kathleen shakes her head no.

			     FRANK
		But we're so right for each other.

			     KATHLEEN
		I know.

	A long beat.

			     KATHLEEN
		That woman on television, right?
		Sidney-Ann.

	Frank nods.

			     FRANK
		I mean, nothing's happened or anything.

			     KATHLEEN
		I think she's a Republican.

			     FRANK
		I can't help myself.

	Kathleen pats him.

			     FRANK (cont'd)
		What about you?  Is there someone else?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, somewhere out there, I'm sure.
		Somewhere --
			(she throws up her hands)
		In cyberspace.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	As Frank, carrying a typewriter, walks out off Kathleen's
	building and puts it into the back of a taxicab.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As a sign goes up in the window: "Closing This Week: All
	Stock 40% off."

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - LATE THAT DAY

	The store is crowded.  People are buying stacks of books.
	We hear brief snatches of conversation: Birdie telling a
	customer she's planning to travel, Christina saying she's
	finally going to have to finish her dissertation, George
	saying he's been offered a job at Foxbooks but even though
	it's okay with Kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were
	the last place on the earth.

	There is a frantic, rummage sale atmosphere.

	Kathleen, busy at the cash register, looks up for a minute at
	her beautiful store being ravaged by vultures.  We hear the
	sound of the computer and hear her voice-over:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My store is closing this week.
		I own a store.  Did I ever tell you that?
		Probably not.  It's a lovely store --

	As a woman dumps a huge stack of books on the checkout table.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		This is a tragedy.
			(yelling across the shop to her
			 husband)
		Honey, grab a copy of The Trumpet of the
		Swan.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		-- and in a week, it will be something
		really depressing, like a Baby Gap.  I
		am being amazingly brave --

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		What are you going to do with yourself?

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't know.  I'm going to take some
		time.  I have a little money saved.  I'm
		almost looking forward to it --

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		I am so cheerful I would make Pollyanna
		throw up.

			     SECOND SHOPPER
		I came here every Saturday when I was a
		little girl.  I remember when your mother
		gave me Anne of Green Gables.  "Read it
		with a box of Kleenex," that's what she
		told me.

			     THIRD SHOPPER
		She's looking down on you right now.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm sure she is.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		I have promised myself I'm not going
		to cry.

	A FORTH SHOPPER approaches the counter with a stack of books
	up to his chin, and manages to slide the stack on the 
	counter.

			     FOURTH SHOPPER
		We should bomb Foxbooks.

			     KATHLEEN
		It's not their fault.  The truth is, the
		world is just... different.

	She starts ringing up the sale.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

	As Kathleen walks home.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		Soon we'll just be a memory.  In fact,
		someone, some foolish person will
		probably think it's a tribute to this
		city, the way it keeps changing on you,
		the way you can never count on it, or
		something.  I know, because that's the
		sort of thing I'm always saying.  But the
		truth is, I'm heartbroken.  I feel as if
		part of me has died,  and my mother has
		died all over again, and no one can ever
		make it right.

	She stops in front of the window, watching the customers
	lined up to buy books.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

	As Kathleen enters and looks around.

	She goes up the stairs.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT

	As Kathleen walks into it.

	It's huge, of course.  With its reading area, and stage, and
	room for displays, and child-size furniture, and so many
	books and so many customers.

	Kathleen sits down on a little child-size chair, completely
	wilted.

	KATHLEEN FROM ANOTHER P.O.V.

	And now we see Joe watching her, from a distance.  She doesn't
	see him.

	A woman browsing, stops a sales person.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		Do you have the "Shoe" books?

			     SALESPERSON
		The "Shoe" books?  Who's the author?

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		I don't know.  My friend told me my
		daughter has to read the "Shoe" books, 
		so here I am.

			     KATHLEEN
		Noel Streatfeild.  Noel Streatfeild wrote
		Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes and
		Theater Shoes and Movie Shoes...
			(she starts crying as she tells
			 her)
		I'd start with Skating Shoes, it's my
		favorite, although Ballet Shoes is
		completely wonderful.

			     SALESPERSON
		Streatfeild.  How do you spell that?

			     KATHLEEN
		S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-I-L-D.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		Thank you.

	As she walks away.

			     KATHLEEN
			(to herself)
		They know nothing, they know absolutely
		nothing.

	ON JOE

	as he watches her.  We hear the sound of the computer.

	She starts out of the store.  And hold on him.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm sorry.

	INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN

	A screen which says Reply and which now reads "I'm sorry."

	INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY

	On Joe at his computer, staring at the screen.

			     JOE
		Asshole.

	He backspaces, deleting.  Starts typing again.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm sorry.  I don't know what to say.
		Truly I don't.  And anything I do say
		will sound trite.  I hope you feel
		better.

	He sits there, appalled at his own triteness.

	EXT. JOE'S STREET - NIGHT

	As a taxi comes down the street and stops in front of Joe's
	building.

			     PATRICIA (V.O.)
		What I was thinking was she'd probably
		make a great children's book either.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Why would you think that?

	They get out of the cab.

			     PATRICIA
		She knows everything.  She has flawless
		taste.  She's famous for it.
		The salesmen swear by her.  If she likes
		it, it sells.  Period.

	INT. JOE'S LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

	As they enter the lobby and walk toward the elevator.

			     JOE
		So you're going to offer her a job?

			     PATRICIA
		Why not?  What else has she got to do?

			     JOE
		Now that she's destitute --

			     PATRICIA
		Thanks to you.

			     JOE
		Well, I can't imagine her working for
		you.

			     PATRICIA
		Why not?

			     JOE
		She has a horrible personality, she's...
		nice to everyone all the time.  It's
		exhausting.  And her staff turnover is
		... non-existent.  They've been there
		forever.  Until... recently, when they
		all found out they were going to lose
		their jobs.

			     PATRICIA
		Thanks to you.

	The elevator door is closing.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		Hold the elevator!

	They get in.

	INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

			     JOE
		Hello, Charlie, Veronica.

			     PATRICIA
		Last time, we rode in an elevator, we
		made the deal of the century.  What is
		going to happen this time?

			     CHARLIE
		Miss Grant's going to get me a part in
		one of her movies, that's what's going
		to happen.

			     VERONICA
		In your dream, Charlie.

			     PATRICIA
			(back to the conversation with
			 Joe)
		I love how you've totally forgotten you
		had any role in her current situation.
		It's so obtuse.  It reminds me of someone
		... Who?  Who does it remind me of?
			(thinks for a moment)
		Me!

	The elevator suddenly stops.

			     PATRICIA
		Shit.

			     VERONICA
		Shit.

			     JOE
		It is stuck?

			     CHARLIE
		Could be.

	He pushes the open button.  Nothing.  Turns the key, hits the
	open button, flicks the emergency switch.  The he starts
	hitting the buttons in every possible combination.

			     JOE
		Charlie, what are you doing?

			     CHARLIE
		Bang the door.

			     PATRICIA
		Really.

	Joe bangs the door.  Nothing.

			     CHARLIE
		I hope this thing doesn't plummet to the
		basement.

			     VERONICA
		Can it do that?

			     JOE
		No.

	He picks up the phone.

			     JOE
		This is Joe Fox.  Who is this?  Hi, Juan.
		We're stuck on the sixth floor.  There
		are four of us --

			     PATRICIA
			(grabs the phone)
		-- and if you don't get your ass up here
		in two shakes and get us out --

	He hangs up.

			     JOE
			(to Veronica)
		Are you all right?

			     VERONICA
		It's hot.

	Joe hands her his handkerchief.

			     CHARLIE
		Everyone should jump in the air.

			     PATRICIA
		What?

			     CHARLIE
		We jump.  The elevator thinks that no one
		is here and it opens.

	Everyone stares at each other.

			     JOE
		One -- two -- three --

	They all jump into the air.

	They all land.

	Nothing happens.

	INT. ELEVATOR - A LITTLE LATER

	Patricia is sitting on the elevator floor, polishing her
	nails.

	We hear the fire department banging outside...

			     VERONICA
		If I ever get out of here, I'm going to
		start speaking to my mother.  She slept
		with Oscar, and maybe it was Oscar's
		fault, I don't know, and then she sold
		the story to Inside Edition.
		That could have been Oscar's idea, too.
		Who knows?  But I divorced him.  I wonder
		what she's doing right this minute.  I
		think of her... whenever I hear about a
		new pill.  Ecstasy, Zoloft, Fenphen, I
		just think, I hope Mama knows about that.

	She takes out a tissue and dabs at her eyes.

			     PATRICIA
		Maybe you can make up on Rosie.  That
		would be so great for the book.

			     CHARLIE
			(trying to figure it out)
		If I ever get out of here...

			     PATRICIA
		If I ever get out of here, I'm having my
		eyes lasered.

			     CHARLIE
		I'm marrying Oreet.  I love her.  I
		should marry her.  I don't know what's
		been stopping me.

	He takes out his wallet and looks at a picture of Oreet,
	shows it to Joe.

			     JOE
		If I ever get out of here, I'm going to --

	He stops, he looks at Patricia who is fishing through her
	purse.

			     PATRICIA
		Where is my TicTacs?
			(looks at Joe)
		What?

	The firemen crowbar open the elevator door.

	EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - NIGHT

	Joe and Brinkley walk out on the dock toward Joe's boat.  Joe
	is carrying Brinkley's pillow, his laptop and a suitcase.

	He boards his boat and goes below.  A light goes on.  We hear
	the sound of the computer.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I came home tonight and got into the
		elevator to go to my apartment.  An hour
		later, I got out of the elevator and
		Brinkley and I moved out.  Suddenly
		everything had become clear.
			(continued)

	INT. BOAT - NIGHT

	A small sleeping area with a berth and a little table, where
	Joe's laptop has been hooked up to the phone.

	Joe is on the narrow berth, as is Brinkley.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		It's a long story.  Full of the personal
		details we avoid so carefully...

	Joe puts Brinkley on the floor, on his pillow.  Brinkley
	jumps back onto the berth with Joe.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Kathleen is making tea.  She starts toward the bedroom.  We
	see her computer, now hooked up in the living room, where all
	of Frank's typewriters used to be.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I wonder whether change isn't a kind of
		infection.  You start with one thing --
		something you never ever thought would
		change and it does --
			(continued)

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		and the next thing you know even your bed
		is in a different place.
			(continued)

	Kathleen enters the bedroom and we see the entire room has
	been rearranged.

	She gets into bed and turns on the television set.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	The bookshelves are empty.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		Six months ago, when you and I first met,
		I knew everything about myself -- what I
		would be doing for the rest of my life
		and even the person I would be doing it
		with.  Now I know nothing.

	On the door is a small sign.  "After 42 years, we are closing
	our doors.  We have loved being part of your lives."

	Kathleen turns out the light in the store and opens the door.

	The little bell over the door jingles.

	Kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches
	it.

	Then she comes out of the store, carrying the bell.

	Kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate
	for the last time.

	The grate starts to lower.

	Kathleen looks at her store, one last time.  Then she walks
	off, carrying the bell.  We hear it jingle in the night.

	And hold on The Shop Around the Corner, and it slowly turns
	into a computer-enhanced version of itself.

	And then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty
	screen.

	EXT. A BLUE SKY WITH A BIG COMPUTER SUN SHINING IN IT, AND PAN 
	DOWN TO:

	A COMPUTER VERSION OF COLUMBUS AVENUE

	The trees sprout leaves and birdies start to tweet.  And the
	scene turns into a real version of:

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVE. - FOXBOOKS - MORNING

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	George is now the head of the children department at the
	store and he is sitting in the children's section on an itty-
	bitty chair.  His staff is sitting on little itty-bitty
	chairs too.

			     GEORGE
		Then, in the 19th century, Caldecott
		revolutionized the publishing of
		children's books by the introduction of
		color illustrations --

	We see:

	THE STAFF

	Several are dozing.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE & 72ND - DAY

	Joe walks past the Eleanor Roosevelt statue.  He's with
	Annabel and Matt:

			     JOE
		What about going to the Children's Zoo?

			     ANNABEL
		I don't want to go to the Children's Zoo.

			     JOE
		Okay.  The Staten Island Ferry.

			     ANNABEL
		I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

			     MATT
		I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

			     JOE
		Well we can't go to the Storybook Lady.

	INT. JAPANESE NOODLE RESTAURANT - DAY

	Annabel is sitting in her chair, staring glumly at a bowl of
	Japanese soup and noodles.

			     JOE
		I'll read you a story.

			     ANNABEL
		Where did she go?

			     JOE
		She had to close her store.

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		She didn't have enough business.

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		Well.  Her store was very close to our
		store, and you know our store sells books
		at a slightly lower cost --

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		Why do we sell at a lower cost?  So more
		people can buy books.

			     ANNABEL
		Why couldn't she sell that way too?

			     JOE
		Because she's small and we're big.  How
		about we go get some candy?

			     ANNABEL
		So now she's gone and it's all your
		fault.

			     JOE
		It's business, Annabel.  It's not
		personal.  How about we go get so much
		candy you'll be bouncing off the walls
		for days?

			     MATT
		What's personal?

			     ANNABEL
		Personal means that she's gone forever,
		and now we'll never get another book from
		her as long as we ever live.

	She burst into tears.  Matt bursts into tears too.

			     JOE
		Remember the man who worked with her?

			     ANNABEL
			(a wail)
		No.

			     JOE
		Well I hired him.

			     ANNABEL
		You killed the Storybook Lady.

	Matt throws himself on the ground, crying.

	Annabel sobs hysterically.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	George is wearing the same pointed hat Kathleen wore as the
	Storybook Lady.  There's a sign that says: Storybook Person.

	Several children are listening.

	We see:

	ANNABEL

	She's glowering.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Kathleen is in bed with a huge box of Kleenex.  She has a 
	terrible cold.  Her nose is red, her eyes are watery.  On the
	bedside table are a huge assortment of atomizers, pills, etc.

	We hear the sound of computer keys clicking.

			      JOE (V.O.)
		Why haven't you written?

		     	     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I have a cold.

	INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY

	We see Joe on his computer.

		     	     JOE (V.O.)
		How's your cold?

		     	     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My ears are blocked, my nose is clogged.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	She's drinking cranberry juice.  Joni Mitchell on the stereo.

	The sound of computer keys clicking again.

		    	      JOE (V.O.)
		Are you feeling any better?

		     	     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I'm lying in bed listening to Joni
		Mitchell and drinking cranberry juice
		which I am sorry to say is the exact same
		color as my nose.  I keep thinking about
		my future.  What future?  What am I 
		going to do?

	EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - LATE AFTERNOON

	As Joe is walking Brinkley back to the boat.  A limousine has
	pulled up near the pier and the driver is unloading bags.
	Joe stops to see the passenger: his father, Nelson Fox.

			     JOE
		What are you doing here?

	EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - DUSK

	Next to Joe's boat is a larger yacht.

	INT. YACHT - NIGHT

	In the main cabin Joe and Nelson are having drinks.  Nelson
	lifts his glass in a toast.

			     NELSON
		To us.

			     JOE
		Father and son, together at last.  That
		happened with Gillian?

	Nelson ignores the question.

			     NELSON
		I've stayed here after, let's see, your
		mother, Laurette that ballet dancer --

			     JOE
		-- the nanny --

			     NELSON
		Was she the nanny?  I forgot that.  How
		ironic.  Then there was the ice skater --

			     JOE
		-- also the nanny --

			     NELSON
		Really.  How amazingly ironic.  Sybil the
		astrologer.

			     JOE
		Whose moon turned out to be in somebody
		else's house, as I recall.

			     NELSON
		Just like Gillian.

			     JOE
		Gillian ran off with someone?

			     NELSON
		The nanny.

			     JOE
		Nanny Maureen?  Gillian ran off with
		Nanny Maureen?  That's incredibly
		ironic.

			     NELSON
		True true.

			     JOE
		There's no other word for it.

			     NELSON
		Who did you break up with?

			     JOE
		Patricia.  You met her.

			     NELSON
		Would I like her?
			(cracks himself up)
		Just kidding.  Isn't this great?  Have
		some peanuts.  Of course I have to live
		out of a suitcase for a least three
		weeks, and then there's the inevitable
		legal hassle, more of your inheritance
		down the drain.

			     JOE
		Don't worry about it.

			     NELSON
		I won't.  But then I get to meet someone
		new.  That's the easy part.

			     JOE
		Oh, right, a snap to find the one single
		person in the world who fills your heart
		with joy.

			     NELSON
		Don't be ridiculous.  Have I ever been
		with anyone who fits that description?
		Have you?

			     JOE
		On to the next.

			     NELSON
		Isn't it a beautiful night?

	Hold on Joe.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DAY

	Joe, on his way to Kathleen's apartment building, carrying a
	bunch of daisies, wrapped in cellophane.

	Joe goes up the stoop to her building and looks at buzzer.
	Sees Kelly, 3A.  He presses.  Nothing.  Presses again.

			     KATHLEEN
			(voice clogged, through
			 intercom)
		Who is it?

			     JOE
		Joe Fox.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

	Kathleen, in her pajamas, at the intercom, horrified.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you doing here?

			     JOE
		May I please come up?

			     KATHLEEN
		It's really not a good idea.

	Someone else walks up to the door, unlocks it and walks in.
	Joe follows.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

			     KATHLEEN
			(into the intercom)
		I have a terrible cold, can you hear it?
		I'm sniffling and not really awake --

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen continues to talk through the Intercom to an
	empty stoop.

			     KATHLEEN'S VOICE
		and I'm sleeping practically twenty-four
		hours a day, and taking echinacea --

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

			     KATHLEEN
			(into intercom)
		-- and vitamin C, so I would really
		appreciate it if you would come some
		other time --

	There's a knock on the door right next to her.  Kathleen
	practically jumps out of her skin.  She looks through the
	peephole.  There he is.

			     JOE
		Kathleen?

			     KATHLEEN
		Just a second.

	She puts on a robe, runs frantically about picking up various
	scattered wadded-up Kleenexs, opens the front door.  Joe is
	holding a bunch of flowers wrapped in paper.

			     JOE
		Hello.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you doing here?

			     JOE
		I heard you were sick and I was worried
		and I wanted to --
			(he hears voices)
		Is someone here?

			     KATHLEEN
		Just the Home Shopping Network.

			     JOE
		Bought any porcelain dolls?

			     KATHLEEN
		I was thinking about it.
			(beat)
		You put me out of business --

			     JOE
		I know that --

			     KATHLEEN
		And now you turn up with flowers?  Did
		you come to gloat?

			     JOE
		No.

			     KATHLEEN
		To offer me a job --

			     JOE
		No, I wouldn't think of --

			     KATHLEEN
		Because I have plans, I have lots of
		offers.  I've been offered a job by --
		well, actually by --

			     JOE
		My former?

			     KATHLEEN
		Former?

			     JOE
		We broke up.

			     KATHLEEN
		That's too bad.  You seemed so perfect
		for each other.
			(she claps her hand over her
			 mouth)
		I don't mean to say things like that.  No
		matter what you have done to me, there is
		no excuse for my saying anything like
		that.  But every time I see you --

			     JOE
		Things like that just seem to fly out of
		your mouth.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm starting over.
			(sharply)
		Thank you for coming.  Goodbye.
			(she says it again, a little
			 more nicely)
		Thank you for coming. Goodbye.

	She starts to the door.

			     JOE
		I bought you flowers.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh.
			(trying as hard as she can)
		Thank you.

	She takes them.

	He takes them back.

			     JOE
		Why don't I put them in water?

	He heads for the kitchen.  A beat, while she stares after him.
	Then follows.

	INT. KITCHEN - DAY

	When Kathleen gets to the kitchen, Joe is checking the kettle
	for water.  Turns on the stove.

			     JOE
		You're sick.  Sit down, please.

	He pulls out a kitchen chair.  Kathleen sits.  She's a little
	woozy.

			     JOE
		Vase?

			     KATHLEEN
		Upper left.

	He gets out a vase.  Fills it with water.

			     JOE
		George says hello.  He told me you
		weren't feeling well.

			     KATHLEEN
		How is George?

			     JOE
		Great.  He's revolutionizing the place.
		No one is allowed to work in his
		department who doesn't have a Ph.D. in
		children's literature.

	He unwraps the paper around the flowers.  Daisies.  Puts them
	in a vase.

			     KATHLEEN
		I love daisies.

			     JOE
		You told me.

	He puts the vase on the kitchen table.  Kathleen plays with
	the petals.

			     KATHLEEN
		They're so friendly.  Don't you think
		they are the friendliest flower?

			     JOE
		I do.

			     KATHLEEN
		When did you break up?

			     JOE
		Oh, a couple of weeks ago.

			     KATHLEEN
		Everyone is breaking up.  You.  Me.  This
		other person I know broke up with someone
		in an elevator.  I think it was in an
		elevator.  Or just outside it.  Or after
		it.  It got stuck.  I think.  And suddenly
		everything became clear.  When I saw you,
		at the coffee place, I was waiting for him
		and I was --

			     JOE
		-- charming.

			     KATHLEEN
		I was not charming.

			     JOE
		Well, you looked charming.

	The teakettle whistles.  Joe turns off the burner.

			     JOE
		Tea?

			     KATHLEEN
		Upper right.

	He gets out mugs and teabags and pours the water.

			     KATHLEEN
		I was upset.  And I was horrible.

			     JOE
		Honey?

	Kathleen nods.  He puts in two spoonfuls, gives it to her.

			     JOE
		I was horrible.

			     KATHLEEN
		True.  But I have no excuse.

	She picks up the daisies and carries them into:

	INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Joe follows her.  They both sit.

			     JOE
		Whereas I am a horrible person and have
		no choice but to be horrible, is that
		what you're saying?

			     KATHLEEN
		No I am not saying that because I am done
		saying horrible things, even to you.

			     JOE
		You did it again.

	She claps her hand over her mouth.

			     JOE
		I put you out of business.  You're
		entitled to hate me.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't hate you --

			     JOE
		But you'll never forgive me.  Like
		Elizabeth.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     JOE
		Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice.
		She was too proud --

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought you hated Pride and Prejudice.

			     JOE
		-- or was she too prejudiced and Mr.
		Darcy too proud?  I can never remember.
			(beat)
		It wasn't personal --

			     KATHLEEN
		-- It was business.  What is that
		supposed to mean?  I am so sick of that.
		All it means is it's not personal to you,
		but it's personal to me, it's personal to
		a lot of people.
			(she shrugs helplessly)
		What's wrong with personal anyway?

			     JOE
		Nothing.

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, whatever else anything is, it
		ought to begin by being personal.

	Kathleen stands up, picks up the daisies.

			     KATHLEEN
		My head's starting to get funny.  I have
		to go back to bed.

	They walk to...

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen puts the daisies next to the bed and gets into it.
	She fluffs up the pillows, pulls up the blankets, surrounds
	herself with Kleenex and Evian and sneezes a gigantic sneeze.

			     KATHLEEN
		Why did you stop by?  I forget.

			     JOE
		I wanted to be your friend.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh.

			     JOE
		I knew it wasn't possible.  What can I
		say?  Sometimes a person just wants the
		impossible.  Could I ask you something?

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     JOE
		What happened with that guy at the cafe?

			     KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

			     JOE
		But you're crazy about him --

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.  I am.

			     JOE
		Then why don't you run off with him?
		What are you waiting for?

	A long beat.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't actually know him.

			     JOE
		Really.

			     KATHLEEN
		We only know each other -- oh God, you're
		not going to believe this --

			     JOE
		Let me guess.  From the Internet.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		You've Got Mail.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		Very powerful words.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

	Joe sits on the edge of the bed.

			     JOE
		I'm happy for him.  Although -- could I
		make a little suggestion?  I think you
		should meet him.  No.  I take it back.
		Why meet him?

			     KATHLEEN
			(starting to get sharp again)
		I hardly think I need advice from someone
		who --

	He reaches out and gently claps his hand over her mouth.  And
	holds it there.  It's unexpectedly tender and sexy.

			     JOE
		I concede I bring out the worst in you,
		but let me help you not to say something
		you'll just torture yourself about for
		years to come.

	She starts to smile and he removes his hand.

	They look at each other.

			     JOE
		I hope you're better soon.  It would be 
		a shame to miss New York in the spring.

	Joe stands.

			     KATHLEEN
		Thank you for the daisies.

	He starts for the door.

			     JOE
		Take care.

			     KATHLEEN
		I will.

			     JOE
		Goodbye.

			     KATHLEEN
		Goodbye.

	We hear the door close.

	Hold on Kathleen.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Christina is running.  She sees a good-looking MALE RUNNER
	coming toward her.  She has no hope that he will notice her,
	and starts to look away as they get close to one another.

			     MALE RUNNER
		Hi.

			     CHRISTINA
		Hi.

	He passes her.  Christina can't believe it.

	She does a little dance of joy.

	Camera pulls back as we see her by the reservoir on a 
	beautiful morning doing her little celebratory spin.

	Then she resumes her morning exercise, running on.

	INT. THE SINGLES TEMPLE - FRIDAY EVENING

	Patricia comes in.

	The place is packed.  There are hundreds of young Jewish New
	Yorkers singing folk songs and dancing the hora.  The Rabbi
	is dancing among them.

	Patricia sees the rabbi, leading the dance.

	The rabbi whirls madly toward her, like a human dreidel.

			     RABBIT
		Shabbat shalom!

	He grabs Patricia's hand, and to her surprise, they go
	whirling off together.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen at the computer, typing.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I have been thinking about this and
		I think we should meet.

	She clicks the send button and then exits from American On
	Line.

	On her computer screen we now see the standard screen with
	several icons: American On-Line, Word, Recycle Bin, etc.

	She clicks Word.

	She goes to File: New.

	There are several choices of format.

	She stares at the choices.  Then she clicks Book format.

	A blank page appears in the computer.

	She starts to type:  "Once upon a time there was a little
	girl named..."

	She pauses for a moment and looks around the room.  She sees
	the flowers that Joe brought her.

	And then she types: "Daisy."

	As she goes on typing...

	INT. JOE' BOAT - NIGHT

	On Joe typing.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		We should meet.  And we will meet.  But
		I'm in the middle of a project that
		needs...
			(he pauses to think of the
			 right word)
		... tweaking.

	A look of calculation on his face.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	We can see Kathleen through the window, drinking a cup of
	coffee.

	And now we see Joe walk into Starbucks.  He waves at her,
	pretending surprise at seeing her.  Has he been watching the
	store and waiting for her to come in?  We'll never know.

	INT. STARBUCKS - A FEW MINUTES LATER

	He's sitting next to her at the counter in the window.

			     JOE
		Tweaking?

			     KATHLEEN
		That's what he said.

			     JOE
		He's probably married.

			     KATHLEEN
		That's a terrible thing to say.  It's not
		possible.

			     JOE
		Have you asked him if he's married?  Have
		you said, "Are you married?"

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

	Joe looks at her, shrugs.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As she types:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I know this is probably a little late to
		be asking, but are you married?

	INT. JOE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	As he answers:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Am I married?  What kind of a question is
		that?  How can you ask me that?  Don't
		you know me at all?  Oh wait, I get it.
		Your friends are telling you the reason
		we haven't met is that I'm married.  Am I
		right?

	INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - ANOTHER DAY

	Kathleen and Joe having nachos.

			     JOE
		So he didn't exactly answer.

			     KATHLEEN
		He did too.  He nailed me.  He knew
		exactly what I was up to.  Which is just
		like him.

			     JOE
		But he didn't exactly answer, did he?
		Did he?

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

			     JOE
		Maybe he's fat.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't care about that.

			     JOE
		You don't care that he might be one of
		those guys who's so fat he has to be
		removed from his house with a crane?

			     KATHLEEN
		That's very unlikely.

			     JOE
		Why else do you think he's putting off
		meeting you?  Although... maybe that's
		not it.  Maybe...

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     JOE
		Never mind.

			     KATHLEEN
		What????

			     JOE
		He could be waiting til he's paroled.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, you won't believe this, there was a
		moment when George thought he might be
		the rooftop killer, which was completely
		ridiculous --

	Her voice trails off, as she considers whether it could be
	true.

			     JOE
		What's his handle?

	She shakes her head.

			     JOE
		Come on, I'm not going to write him.  Is
		that what you think?

			     KATHLEEN
		NY 152.

			     JOE
		One five two.  One hundred fifty two.
		Very interesting.  He's 152 years old.
		He has 152 hairs remaining on his head.
		He's had 152 moles removed and now he
		has 152 pockmarks.

	EXT. FARMER'S MARKET ON BROADWAY - LATER

	As they walk past tables of bread and flowers, etc.

			     JOE
		His combined college board scores.

			     KATHLEEN
		His IQ.

			     JOE
		The number of women he's slept with.

			     KATHLEEN
		The number of times he's seen The
		Godfather.

			     JOE
		That's the first good thing I've heard
		about him.

			     KATHLEEN
		His address.  No, no, no.  He would never
		do anything that prosaic.

	On Joe, looking a little wounded.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		The only thing I really care about
		besides the married thing... and the
		jail thing... is the boat thing.

			     JOE
		The boat thing?

			     KATHLEEN
		I could never be with anyone who has
		a boat.

			     JOE
		Oh.

			     KATHLEEN
		So that clinches it.  We'll never be
		together.  I'll take care of these.

	He picks up a mango, squeezes it.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		I could never be with anyone who likes
		Joni Mitchell.
			(singing, imitating Joni)
		"It's cloud's illusions I recall, I
		really don't know clouds at all."  
		What does that mean?

	Joe waits for Kathleen to say she likes Joni Mitchell.

	But Kathleen doesn't say anything.

	She starts intently picking over apples, trying to find some
	she wants.

			     JOE
		How's your book coming?

	EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

	As they walk away from the market, going uptown.

			     KATHLEEN
		There's a children's book editor I know,
		from the store, and she's excited to 
		read it.  When I finish it.  Who would 
		ever have thought I'd write?  I mean,
		if I didn't have all this free time, I
		would never have discovered --

	She stops, realizing what she's saying.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		The truth is, he was the one who made me
		start thinking about writing --

			     JOE
		Mister 152 Felony Indictments --

			     KATHLEEN
		Mister 152... insights into my soul.

			     JOE
		Yes.  Well.  Can't compete with that.

			     KATHLEEN
		Well.  I keep bumping into you.  Hope
		your mango's ripe.

			     JOE
		I think it is.  Want to bump into me
		Saturday?  Around lunchtime?

	EXT. COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT

	As Joe types.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		How about meeting Saturday?  The first
		day of spring.  4 P.M.  There's a place
		in Riverside Park at 88th Street where
		the path curves and when you come around
		the curve, you'll find me waiting.

	INT./EXT. SATURDAY - GREY'S PAPAYA - THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING

	Kathleen and Joe are putting mustard on their hot dogs.

			     JOE
		Today?

			     KATHLEEN
		Today.

			     JOE
		Whoa.

			     KATHLEEN
		I know.  In Riverside Park.

			     JOE
		Isn't that amazing?  Maybe I've seen him,
		and I don't even know it.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	As they walk uptown, eating their hot dogs and drinking
	papaya drinks.

			     JOE
		He could be the Zipper Man.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who's that?

			     JOE
		This guy on Amsterdam who repairs
		zippers.  You'll never have to buy new
		luggage.

			     KATHLEEN
		Stop teasing.

			     JOE
		Timing is everything.  He waited until
		you were primed.  Until you knew there
		was no other man you could ever love.

			     KATHLEEN
			(almost believe it)
		Yes.

			     JOE
		Sometimes I wonder...

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

	They stop walking, they look at each other.

			     JOE
		If I hadn't been Foxbooks and you hadn't
		been The Shop Around the Corner and we'd
		just met --

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't.

			     JOE
		I would have asked for your phone number
		and I wouldn't have been able to wait 24
		hours before calling and asking, "How
		about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie,
		for as long as we both shall live?"

			     KATHLEEN
			(almost a swoon)
		Joe...

			     JOE
		And then we would never have been at war.

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

			     JOE
		The only fight we'd ever have is what
		video to rent on Saturday night.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who fights about that?

			     JOE
		Some people.  Not us.

			     KATHLEEN
		We would never.

	A long beat.

			     JOE
		If only...

			     KATHLEEN
		Please.  I have to go.

	She doesn't move.

			     JOE
		Let me ask you something?  How come
		you'll forgive him for standing you
		up and you won't forgive me for a 
		little tiny thing like putting you
		out of business?

	Kathleen looks at him.  Shakes her head.

	They look at each other.

			     JOE
		Oh how I wish you would.

	It's all Kathleen can do not to forgive him.

	It's all Joe can do not to kiss her.

			     KATHLEEN
		I really do have to go.

			     JOE
		You don't want to be late.

	She's in agony.

	He turns and walks away.

	After a moment, she does too.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

	As we see Kathleen come down the street and walk into her
	house.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

	As she comes out of the apartment house, having changed her
	clothes.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - LATER AFTERNOON

	As she comes toward the entrance to the park.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

	As Kathleen comes down a path in the park, near 88th Street.

	She comes to a stop.

	Looks around.

	A young woman in running clothes passes by.

	A young father pushing a baby in one of those strollers
	runners use to push babies in.

	Kathleen looks at her watch.

	Suddenly she hears a noise.  A dog barking.

	And Brinkley comes around the corner.

			     VOICE
		Brinkley!  Brinkley!

	And hold on Kathleen as she sees.

	JOE

	And she starts to cry.

	And he comes to her.  And puts his arms around her.

			     JOE
		Don't cry, Shopgirl, don't cry.

			     KATHLEEN
		I wanted it to be you.  I wanted it to
		be you so badly.

	And as they kiss, we hold on them.

	And crane up and away as we see them, a couple kissing in the
	park on a beautiful spring day.

	A dog is leaping around them.

	And as we get further and further away from them, the screen
	turns into

	CYBERSPACE

	And the dog turns cartwheels and flipflops.

	And we tilt up to see the clouds and the sky

	and hear the sound of computer keys, clicking, clicking,
	clicking

					FADE OUT
You've Got Mail

			by Nora Ephron & Delia Ephron

			Based on:
				
			The Shop Around The corner

			by Nikolaus Laszlo



	
							2nd Final White revised
							February 2, 1998

	

	FADE IN ON:

	CYBERSPACE

	We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a
	sky that's just beginning to get light.  There are a few
	stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big
	computer sun starts to rise.

	We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading
	over a computer version of the New York City skyline.  We
	move over Central Park.  It's fall and the leaves are
	glorious reds and yellows.

	We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down
	Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and
 	turn onto a street in the West 80s.

	Hold in front of a New York brownstone.

	At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the
	words:

	ADDING ART

	As the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a percentage
	increase from 0% to 100%.  When it hits 100% the image pops and 
	we are in real life.

	EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - DAY

	Early morning in New York. A couple of runners pass on their
	way to Riverside Drive Park.

	We go through the brownstone window into:

	INT. KATHLEEN KELLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

	KATHLEEN KELLY is asleep.  Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and
	fresh as a spring day.  Her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized
	bed and a desk with a computer on it.  Bookshelves line every
	inch of wall space and overflow with books.  Framed on the
	children's classic.  Madeleine.

	As Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into
	the room.  He wears blue jeans and a workshirt.  He's carrying
	the New York Times.

				KATHLEEN
		Good morning.

				FRANK
			(as he reads)
		Listen to this -- the entire work force
		of the state of Virginia had to have
		solitaire removed from their computers --

	Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the
	bathroom, and we stay with Frank.

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		-- because they hadn't done any work in
		six weeks.

	Kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe.

				KATHLEEN
		Aren't you late?

				FRANK
			(continuing)
		You know what this is, you know what
		we're seeing here?  We're seeing the end
		of Western civilization as we know it.

				KATHLEEN
		This is so sad.

	She tosses him his jacket.

				FRANK
			(points at her computer)
		You think that machine is your friend,
		but it's not.
			(checks his watch)
		I'm late.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	As Frank walks to the apartment door.  We see a charming room
	with a couch, fireplace, books, and a dining table with a 
	typewriter with a cover on it.

				KATHLEEN (O.C.)
		I'll see you tonight.

				FRANK
		Sushi.

				KATHLEEN (O.C.)
		Great.  Bye.

	Frank goes out the door.  It closes.

	Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye
	peephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing
	from sight.  She walks into:

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	And looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the
	street and turns toward Broadway.

	He's gone.  Good.

	She sits down at her computer.  An expression of anticipation
	and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse.

	INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's
	code name: Shopgirl.  She logs on and the computer makes all
	its little modem noises as the computer dials the access
	number and connects and we hear the machine:

				COMPUTER
		Welcome.

	And we see Kathleen, listening for the words she's waiting to
	hear:

				COMPUTER (cont'd)
		You've got mail.

	And Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up:

	INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	We see a list of letters:

	Big Cash Op: You can make $$$ in your spare time.  OIL MKT: You
	can turn $20 into $20,000 THIS REALLY WORKS U CAN DO IT: 
	Maximize your selling ability nowwwww!!!  NY152 Brinkley

	Kathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters --
	all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.

	Then she selects the "Read Mail" key for "NY 152 Brinkley".

	And the letter comes up:
		   To: Shopgirl
		From: NY152
		   Re: Brinkley

	Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud:

				KATHLEEN
		Brinkley is my dog.  He loves the streets
		of New York as much as I do --

	And now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of
	NY 152, a man named JOE FOX --

				JOE (V.O.)
		-- although he likes to eat bits of pizza
		and bagel off the sidewalk, and I prefer
		to buy them.  Brinkley is a great catcher
		and was offered a tryout on the Mets farm
		team --
			(continued)

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. This
	is BRINKLEY.  The pillow has "Brinkley" embroidered on it.
	Brinkley's master, JOE FOX, a great-looking guy, full of
	charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself
	some orange juice.  He's half-dressed.

				JOE (cont'd)
		-- but he chose to stay with me so that
		he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on
		a large green pillow the size of an inner
		tube.  Don't you love New York in the
		fall?  It makes me want to buy school
		supplies.  I would send you a bouquet of
		newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your
		name and address.  On the other hand,
		this not knowing has its charms.

				VOICE
		Darling --

				JOE
		Mmmmmhmmm --

	Joe's girlfriend PATRICIA EDEN, in Armani head to toe, comes
	into the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine,
	which starts grinding beans.  She's carrying the morning
	papers.

				PATRICIA
		I'm late.
			(indicating the newspaper)
		Random House fired Dick Atkins.  Good
		riddance.  Murray Chilton died.  Which
		makes one less person I'm not speaking 
		to --
			(she drains a cup of espresso
			 as a second starts to come out
			 of the machine)
		Vince got a great review.  He'll be
		insufferable.  Tonight,  PEN dinner --

				JOE
		Am I going?

				PATRICIA
		You promised.

				JOE
		Can't I just give them money?  That's the
		cause?  Free Albanian writers?  I'm for
		that.

	Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.

			     JOE
		All right, I'll go.  You're late.

			     PATRICIA
		I know I know I know.

	She tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her.

	Hold on Joe, listening as he hears the elevator door open and
	close on the landing outside.

	IT. JOE'S DEN - DAY

	As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs 
	on.

			     JOE & THE COMPUTER (TOGETHER)
		Welcome... You've got mail.

	And as he starts to read his letter, we hear:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I like to start my notes to you as if
		we're already in the middle of a
		conversation.  I pretend that we're 
		the oldest and dearest friends --
		as opposed to what we actually are,
		people who don't know each other's names
		and met in a Chat Room where we both
		claimed we'd never been before.

	INT. JOE'S ELEVATOR - DAY

	As Joe, dressed for work, takes the elevator down with his
	elevator man CHARLIE.  There's a certain amount of Good
	morning, etc., as the elevator goes down and the voice-over
	continues:

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		What will he say today, I wonder.  I turn
		on my computer, I wait impatiently as it
		boots up.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - DAY

	As Joe comes out of his building.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		I go on line, and my breath catches in my
		chest until I hear three little words:
		You've got mail.

	And the camera now pans from 152 Riverside uptown to:

	EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - MORNING

				KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
		I hear nothing, not even a sound on the
		streets of New York, just the beat of my
		own heart.  I have mail.  From you.

	EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

	As Kathleen comes onto Broadway at the corner of 83rd Street
	and starts downtown.

	Through a long lens we can see Joe, walking into blocks behind
	her.

	As Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the
	West Side of Manhattan in the morning.  Mothers and fathers
	taking their kids to school, people on their way to work,
	dogs being walked.  School buses picking up kids, bakery
	trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of
	unopened restaurants.

	Kathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the 
	newsstand dealer, and picks up a New York Times.

	Metal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons,
	the pharmacy, fish store, the Cuban Chinese Restaurant,
	Zabar's.

	Joe stops at the same newsstand.  He buys all the papers --
	the Times, Wall Street Journal, Post and Daily News.

	INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Kathleen picks up her coffee, walks out.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	As Kathleen walks down Columbus, we see Joe a block behind
	her.  She stops to buy flowers and Joe passes her, crosses to
	the Ease side of Columbus Avenue.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	A building under construction, with plywood board covering
	the front and wrapping around the corner.  Joe goes to a side
	entrance and enters.

	EXT. COLUMBUS & 73RD STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in
	front of her store, a children's bookstore called "The Shop
	Around the Corner."  It is an irresistibly inviting store.
	There are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large
	stuffed animals reading children's books: Madeleine, Good
	Night Moon, Where the Wild Things Are.  A teddy bear in a 
	pinafore is reading The Stupids Step Out.  Waiting for
	Kathleen in front is one of her employees, CHRISTINA.

				KATHLEEN
		Hello, Christina.  It's a beautiful day.
		Isn't it the most beautiful day?

	Christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first
	time.

				CHRISTINA
		I guess.  Yeah, sure.

	Kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which
	rises, making a horrible noise.  Two cabs almost collide in
	front of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts
	yelling obscenities at the other.  Kathleen unlocks the door
	to the store.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't you love New York in the fall?

	Christina looks at her puzzled.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen turns the CLOSED sign on the door over to read
	"OPEN" and she activates the computer system.  She looks
	around, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore,
	with wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read,
	some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions
	of the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland, etc.  There's a 
	playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered
	with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "The Ten Best
	Witch List"  and a collection of witch books -- "The Lion, The 
	Witch and the Wardrobe," "The Witches," "The Wizard of Oz."
	On the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops.

	Kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and
	suddenly stops to daydream.  A smile creeps onto her face.
	Christina looks at her.

				CHRISTINA
		What's going on with you?

				KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

				CHRISTINA
		You're in love.

				KATHLEEN
		In love?  No.  Yes.  Of course I am.
		I'm in love with Frank.  I'm practically
		living with Frank.  Do you think you
		could get our Christmas mailers out this
		week?

				CHRISTINA
		By Monday I promise.  I have a paper due
		Friday.  Now what's going on?
			(she looks at Kathleen)
		I'm just going to stand here till you tell
		me.

	A beat.

				KATHLEEN
		Is it infidelity if you're involved with
		someone on E-mail?

				CHRISTINA
		Have you had sex?

				KATHLEEN
		Of course not.  I don't even know him.

				CHRISTINA
		I mean cybersex.

				KATHLEEN
		No!

				CHRISTINA
		Well, don't do it.  The minute you do,
		they lose all respect for you.

				KATHLEEN
		It's not like that.  We just E-mail.
		It's really nothing, on top of which I'm
		definitely thinking of stopping because
		it's getting --

				CHRISTINA
		Out of hand?

				KATHLEEN
		Confusing.  But not really.  Because it's
		nothing.

				CHRISTINA
		Where did you meet him?

				KATHLEEN
		I can't even remember.
			(off Christina's look)
		The day I turned thirty I wandered into
		the Over Thirty Room for a joke, sort of
		and he was there, and we started 
		chatting.

				CHRISTINA
		About what?

				KATHLEEN
		Books.  Music.  How much we both love New
		York.  Harmless.  Harmless.  Meaningless.
			(starts smiling)
		Bouquets of sharpened pencils.

				CHRISTINA
		Excuse me?

				KATHLEEN
		Forget it.  We don't talk about anything
		personal.  We made a rule about that.
		I don't know his name, what he does or
		exactly where he lives, so it will be
		really easy to stop seeing him, because
		I'm not.

				CHRISTINA
		God, he could be the next person to talk
		into the store.  He could be...
			(as George walks in)
		George.

	GEORGE PAPPAS, in his twenties, one of Kathleen's 
	salespeople, is a cute guy who has no idea that he's supposed
	to look in the mirror when he gets dressed.

				GEORGE
		Morning.

				CHRISTINA
		Are you On Line?

				GEORGE
		As far as I'm concerned, the Internet is
		just another way to be rejected by a 
		woman.

	BIRDIE walks in.  She is in her seventies, has white hair,
	and is tiny, like a little sparrow.  She is the store's
	oldest employee, having worked there for over forty years,
	and serves as a accountant as well as salesperson.

				KATHLEEN
		Good morning, Birdie.

				BIRDIE
		What are you all talking about?

				CHRISTINA
		Cybersex.

				BIRDIE
		I tried to have cybersex once but I kept
		getting a busy signal.

				CHRISTINA
		I know, I know.  One Saturday night I was
		really depressed about not having a date,
		so I thought, no problemo, I'll go on
		line and I won't be lonely, but I 
		couldn't get on, there were hundreds of
		thousands of people who didn't have dates
		trying to get on.
			(MORE)
		You have to wonder which is harder,
		getting a date or getting On Line when
		you don't have a date.

				GEORGE
		Getting a date is harder.

	We hear the bell jingle as TWO WEST SIDE MOTHERS come in with 
	two KIDS IN STROLLERS.

				KATHLEEN
			(to the kids)
		Jessica and Maia, how are you today?

	We hear the sound of the garbage truck.  Kathleen goes out
	the front door to:

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As the commercial garbage truck pulls up and TWO GARBAGEMEN 
	start to load her trash.

				KATHLEEN
		Hey, you forgot to pick up the garbage
		last week and I got a ticket.  And you're
		late today -- I could have gotten
		another.

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		We were here, there was no garbage.

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

				KATHLEEN
		Of course there was --

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		What do you think, I don't want to pick
		up garbage?  You think I go up and down
		the street picking up garbage, I'm not
		going to pick up yours?  What's the
		matter with you?

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

	Kathleen is standing there, tongue-tied.
	
				GARBAGEMAN #1
		You don't even bundle it right, you're
		supposed to bundle it and leave it near
		the curb, you leave it near the store
		and you use cheap garbage bags, they
		smear all over the place, and then I got
		to pick it up with my shovel --

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	As Christina, who's helping one of the customers, looks out
	the window as the harangue continues.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

				GARBAGEMAN #1
		And now you're busting my chops.  You're
		just another garbage pick-up to us, okay?

				GARBAGEMAN #2
		Yeah.

	As Kathleen continues to stand there, speechless.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen comes back into the store.  Christina is ringing
	up a sale.

				KATHLEEN
		That guy went ballistic on me.

				CHRISTINA
		I hope you told him off.

				KATHLEEN
		Not exactly.

	Another customer enters the store.  The bell jingles.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE ON COLUMBUS - DAY

	A little truck carrying a knife sharpener, its bells ringing,
	passes the building under construction.

	INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

	WORKERS, ELECTRICIANS, MASONS, CARPENTERS, etc. in the 
	process of building what looks like a large store.  Wires
	hanging everywhere.

				KEVIN
		The electrical contractor called.  His
		truck hit a deer last night, he won't be
		in 'til tomorrow.  The shelves are late
		because the shipment of pine had beetles.
		And there's some question about whether
		we're installing the stairs in the right
		spot --

				JOE
		That sounds great.

				KEVIN
		Testing one two three four.

				JOE
		Is the electrician here?

				KEVIN
		I just told you -- he hit a deer.

				JOE
		I hear nothing.  Not a sound on the city
		streets, just the beat of my own heart.
		I think that's the way it goes.
		Something like that.

				KEVIN
			(beginning to glean something)
		Did you and Patricia get engaged?

				JOE
		Engaged?  Are you crazy?

				KEVIN
		I thought you liked Patricia --

				JOE
		I love Patricia.  Patricia's amazing.
		Patricia makes coffee nervous.
			(suddenly all business)
		Are we still on schedule?

				KEVIN
		We open two weeks before Thanksgiving.

				JOE
		I guess we should announce ourselves
		soon.  Tell people we're coming.

				KEVIN
		This is the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
		The minute they hear they'll be lining up
		--

				JOE
		-- to picket --

				KEVIN
		-- the big bad --

				JOE
		--chain store --

				KEVIN
		-- that destroys --

				JOE
		-- everything we hold dear.  But we'll
		seduce them with our square footage and
		our deep armchairs and our amazingly
		swift checkout lines and our discounts
		and our...

				JOE & KEVIN
			(the trump card)
		-- cappuccino.

				JOE
		They hate us in the beginning, but we 
		get them in the end.  Meanwhile we 
		should just put up a sign -- Coming soon, 
		a Foxbooks Superstore and The End of
		Western Civilization As We Know It.

	INT. FOXBOOKS - WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

	Joe is in the office with his father, NELSON FOX, and his
	grandfather, SCHUYLER FOX.  The office has been recently
	redecorated; everything is new and a little overdone.

	On the wall we see the Foxbooks logo.

				JOE
		Kevin and I are both a little concerned
		about the neighborhood response --
			(suddenly notices the garish
			 couch)
		What is this fabric?  Does it have a
		name?

				NELSON
		Money.  Its name is money.

				JOE
		Gillian selected it.

				NELSON
		Of course.

				SCHUYLER
		Your father is getting married again.

				JOE
		Oh, great, congratulations, Dad.  Why?

				NELSON
		Who knows?  Why does anyone get married?

				JOE
		Love.

				NELSON
		Yes, that is one reason.

				SCHUYLER
		I think you're a damn fool.

				NELSON
		Dad, Matthew is four.  It would be nice
		for him if his parents were married.

				SCHUYLER
		Annabel is eight and I'm not married to
		her mother.  I can't even remember her
		mother's name.
			(he laughs merrily)

				JOE
		I have a very sad announcement to make.
		City Books on 23rd Street is going under
		...

	Nelson, Shuyler, and Joe high-five each other.

				NELSON
		Another independent bookstore bites the
		dust --

				SCHUYLER
		On to the next.

				JOE
		And I'm buying their entire stock --
		architecture, New York history -- for the
		new store.

				NELSON
		How much are your paying?

				JOE
		Whatever it costs, it won't be as much as
		this exquisite mohair episode.
			(indicates the couch)
		We're also going to have a section on
		West Side Writers --

				SCHUYLER
		-- as a sop to the neighborhood.

				NELSON
		Perfect.  It'll keep those West Side
		liberal nut pseudo-intellectual bleeding
		hearts --

				JOE
		Readers.  They're called readers.

				NELSON
		Don't romanticize them.  It'll keep them
		from jumping down your throat --

				SCHUYLER
		What's the competition?

				JOE
		One mystery store.  Sleuth, on 86th and
		Amsterdam.  And a children's bookstore.
		The Shop Around the Corner.  Been there
		forever.

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia's store.

				JOE
		Who's that?

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia Kelly, lovely woman.  I think we
		might have had a date once.  Or maybe we
		just exchange letters.

				JOE
		You wrote her letters?

				SCHUYLER
		Mail.  It was called mail.

				NELSON
			(fondly nostalgic and kidding
			 it slightly)
		Stamps.  Envelopes.

				JOE
		Wait.  I've heard of it.  It was a means
		of communication before I was born.

				NELSON
		Exactly.

				SCHUYLER
		Cecilia had beautiful penmanship.
		She was too young for me, but she was...
		enchanting.  Her daughter owns it now.

				NELSON
		Too bad for her.

	As a DECORATOR walks into the office carrying a pile of
	upholstered pillows, and Joe turns to look at them.

				COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
		Welcome.  You've got mail.

				JOE (V.O.)
		My father is getting married again.  For
		five years he's been living with a woman
		who studied decorating at Caesar's
		Palace.

				COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
		You've got mail.

	INT. SUBWAY - DAY

	Kathleen looks up from her book as a butterfly flies through
	the subway car.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Once I read a story about a butterfly in
		the subway, and today I saw one. I
		couldn't believe it.  It got on at 42nd
		--
			(continued)

	The train comes to a stop.  The butterfly flies out.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		-- and got off at 59th, where I assume it
		was going to Bloomindale's to buy a hat
		that will turn out to be a mistake.  As
		almost all hats are.

	EXT. H & H BAGELS - NIGHT

	A flour truck is unloading flour into a hole in the ground.

				JOE (V.O.)
		Did you know that every night a truck
		pulls up to H&H Bagels and pumps about a
		ton of flour into the ground?  The air is
		absolutely amazing.

	As Joe comes around the corner and sees the dust filling the
	air.  It is amazing.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I guess I've read Pride & Prejudice about
		100 times --

	INT. JOE'S KITCHEN - DAY

	As Joe reads a copy of Pride and Prejudice.  He can't stand
	it.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		-- and every time I read it I worry that
		Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are not going to
		get together -- but the truth is whenever
		I think about my favorite book I always
		think about the books I read as a child --

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As Kathleen takes a copy of Homer Price off the shelf.

				JOE (V.O.)
		Did you ever read Homer Price?  My all-
		time favorite children's book.
			(continued)

	She opens it to the illustration of the doughnut machine that
	won't stop making doughnuts.

				JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		There's a doughnut machine in it that
		won't stop making doughnuts, they just
		keep coming down the chute just as
		regular as a clock can tick.

	EXT. KRISPY KREME STORE - DAY

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Have you been to Krispy Kreme?
			(continued)

	Joe, eating a doughnut, looks through the window at the huge
	doughnut machine as the doughnuts roll down the chute just as
	regular as a clock can tick.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		There's a doughnut machine right in the
		window that makes 110 dozen doughnuts an
		hour.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Joe leaves with his morning coffee.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NEW YORK - MORNING

	Joe goes to his painter at work: COMING SOON is as far as he's
	gotten.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	She enters Starbucks.

	INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	As Kathleen buys her morning coffee and listens to everyone
	ordering.

	We can hear the sounds of Starbucks: "Short decaf cap,"  "Tall
	mocha latte."  "Grande lowfat regular."  Etc.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - A HALF HOUR LATER

	The painter is further along on the sign.  It now reads:
	COMING SOON, A FOXBOOKS SU --

	Kathleen walks past the construction site.  She doesn't
	really pay attention to the sign painter.

	We see two police cars barreling up 75th Street, followed by
	a television news truck.

	EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

	The police cars and TV truck barrel uptown.

	EXT. 101st STREET - CONTINUOUS

	They turn left onto West 101st and stop in front of an
	apartment building on the block.  There are more police cars
	and a horde of television reporters with microphones, etc.

	George emerges from the building as a newscaster broadcasts.

				TV REPORTER
		The body of a woman was found this
		morning on the roof of a New York
		building...

	As George comes out of his building into a horde of REPORTERS
	with microphones, cameras, etc. and listens to the reporter,
	who, seeing George, sticks the microphone into his face.

				TV REPORTER
		Here is a resident of the building.  Your
		name, please?

				GEORGE
		George Pappas.

				REPORTER
		Did you see or hear anything unusual last
		night?

				GEORGE
		No.  I didn't go out.

	At that moment, George sees a young woman.  This is MEREDITH
	CARTER.  He is struck dumb.

				REPORTER
		The victim was red-haired, about thirty-
		five, wearing a jogging suit.  Did you
		encounter anyone by that description
		in the building?  Sir?

	George hasn't heard a word.

				REPORTER
		Have there been any wild parties 
		lately?

	George doesn't answer.

				REPORTER
		Could it perhaps be one of your
		neighbors?

	George continues to stare at the beautiful woman.  As he
	does, she notices him.  She stares back.  The reporter,
	ignored, finally turns away.

				REPORTER
			(to camera)
		As you can see, no one here knows
		anything.

	He continues to stand there, dumbstruck for a moment.
	Meredith Carter starts to walk away.

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As George walks along Broadway, past the sign, which now
	says: "COMING SOON: A FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE".  He sees it.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	Kathleen and several CUSTOMERS in the store.

	George walks in and goes to the back to hang up his coat.
	Christina is unpacking boxes.  Birdie is at the desk.  George
	looks at Christina meaningfully.

				CHRISTINA
			(totally mystified)
		What?

				GEORGE
		The coup de foudre. I had one. I
		never believed in them, but I just had
		one.

				BIRDIE
		Is that the thing where you get cold
		suddenly, bang?

				CHRISTINA
		No, that's the coup de vieux.

				BIRDIE
		I had that.

				GEORGE
		The coup de foudre is where you get
		love suddenly, bang.  A thunderbolt.

				BIRDIE
		I had that too.  Only I had it in
		Seville, where it was called ,el
		estruendo de amor.

				GEORGE
		I don't know her name, or anything about
		her.  I may never see her again.

				CHRISTINA
		And if you ever do meet her, you'll find
		out all the horrible details, and that
		will be that.  She'll turn out to have
		pictures of the Virgin Mary all over the
		walls.

				GEORGE
		I won't care.

	Kathleen sticks her head into the back.

				KATHLEEN
		Can someone help me out here?

				CHRISTINA
		George had a coup de foudre.

				GEORGE
		And Christina's making fun of me.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't let her.  I believe in this, I
		completely believe in this.  It happened
		to Madame Bovary, at least six times.

				CHRISTINA
		And she was wrong every time.

				KATHLEEN
		Yes!
			(beat)
		Who was she?

				GEORGE
		I don't know.  She was standing outside
		my building with the police and the
		reporters.

				KATHLEEN
		What police and reporters?

				GEORGE
		Someone died.

				KATHLEEN
		Who?

				GEORGE
		I have no idea about that either.
		They found her on the roof.

				KATHLEEN
		A dead body.  That's so sad.  But
		you fell in love.  That's so great.

				GEORGE
		Oh.  One other thing.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	The sign is now complete and it says: "Coming soon, just
	around the corner.  A Foxbooks Superstore."

	Kathleen and George and Christina stand there looking at it.

				CHRISTINA
		Quel nightmare.

				KATHLEEN
		It has nothing to do with us. It's
		big, impersonal, overstocked and 
		full of ignorant salespeople.

				GEORGE
		But they discount.

				KATHLEEN
		But they don't provide any service.  We
		do.

	George and Christina nod.

	INT. BARNEY GREENGRASS - LUNCHTIME

	Kathleen is having lunch with Birdie.

				KATHLEEN
		So really it's a good development.  You
		know how in the flower district, there
		are all these flower shops in a row so
		you can find whatever you want.  Well,
		this is going to be the book district.
		If you don't have it, we do.

				BIRDIE
		And vice versa.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DUSK

	Kathleen in the kitchen, unloading groceries.  Frank is
	standing there, plugging in an Olympia Report deluxe Electric
	typewriter.

				FRANK
		When you are finished with Foxbooks, the
		Shop Around the Corner is going to be
		responsible for reversing the entire
		course of the Industrial Revolution.

				KATHLEEN
		That is so sweet, Frank.  Thank you.
		That is so sweet.

				FRANK
		Hey --

	He holds his arms out.  They hug.

				KATHLEEN
		Although...

				FRANK
		What?

				KATHLEEN
			(over his shoulder, she notices
			 the typewriter, breaks from
			 the hug)
		What is that doing there?

				FRANK
		Listen to it.  Just listen--

	He strikes a key.  Practically swoons.

				FRANK
		The Olympia Report deluxe Electric
		Report.  As in gunshot.

				KATHLEEN
		That sound is familiar.

				FRANK
		Now listen to this.

	He puts his ear to the typewriter.

	Kathleen listens too.

				KATHLEEN
		That whirring?

				FRANK
		The gentle and soothing lullaby of a
		piece of machinery so perfect --

				KATHLEEN
		I know where I've heard it before.  I
		know.

	She whips a cover off the other typewriter on the table.
	It's the same machine exactly.

				FRANK
		I needed a backup.

				KATHLEEN
		Don't you have another one at your
		apartment?

				FRANK
		I might, I might.  So what?

				KATHLEEN
		You're turning my apartment into a
		typewriter museum.

				FRANK
		I'll stop.  I'll try.  I probably can't.
		I see one and my knees go weak.  Anyway,
		what were you starting to say?

				KATHLEEN
		When?

				FRANK
		Before.

				KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

				FRANK
		Come on.

				KATHLEEN
		I don't know.  I was just wondering about
		my work and all.  I mean, what is it I do
		exactly?  All I really do is run a 
		bookstore --

				FRANK
		All you really do is this incredibly
		noble thing --

	Kathleen nods.

				KATHLEEN
		But I don't know if I --

				FRANK
			(stopping her)
		Kathleen --

				KATHLEEN
		But I just --

				FRANK
		You are a lone reed.

	Kathleen looks puzzled.

	He sticks a piece of paper in the typewriter, starts typing.

				FRANK
		You are a lone reed waving in the 
		breeze standing strong and tall in 
		the corrupt sands of commerce.

	He whips the piece of paper out of the typewriter and hands
	it to her.

				KATHLEEN
			(reading from it)
		I am a lone reed.
			(tries it on again)
		I am a lone reed.

	Clutching her piece of paper, she wanders into the bathroom.

	INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

	We hear the sound of a typewriter begin to clack away in the
	next room.

	Kathleen walks past her computer, looks at it.  Then she goes
	over to the window, looks out at her street at dusk.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DUSK

	A group of schoolgirls in uniform, in two straight lines,
	walk past with a tall woman.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DUSK

	She goes over to the bookshelf and pulls out a copy of
	Madeleine by Ludwig Bemelmans and opens it to the
	illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight lines
	marching through the streets of Paris.  She looks at it, then
	looks up, lost in thought.  We hear the sound of the computer
	keys.

				KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		Sometimes I wonder about my life.  I lead
		a small life.  Well, not small, but
		circumscribed.  And sometimes I wonder,
		do I do it because I like it, or because
		I haven't been brave?  So much of what I
		see reminds me of something I read in a
		book, when shouldn't it be the other way
		around?
			(continued)

	And hold on her as she thinks about this.

	In the other room, we hear Frank typing.

	Kathleen goes to the computer, turns it on.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	As we see Kathleen, through her curtains, a small figure
	barely lit by her computer.

				KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		I don't really want an answer.  I just
		want to send this cosmic question out
		into the void.  So goodnight, dear void.

	INT. DRIP - DAY

	Drip is a cafe on Amsterdam Avenue with Fifties-style couches
	and chairs in cozy seating arrangements.  Kathleen is
	standing at the front counter with Christina, getting drinks.

				CHRISTINA
		I went to the Foxbooks Website and you
		can buy anything.  They ship it to you
		in a day.  Maybe we should get a website.

				KATHLEEN
		My mother would never have wanted us to
		have a website.  "Every book you sell is
		a gift from your heart."  She always said
		that.

	As they walk toward the back of the cafe, Kathleen notices a 
	stack of loose-leaf binders on the table.

				CHRISTINA
		What if they put us out of business?

				KATHLEEN
		It's out of the question.  We're a
		fixture in the neighborhood.  We're
		practically a landmark.
			(indicating the binders)
		Men For Women, Women for Men, Women for
		Women -- what is this?

				CHRISTINA
		You fill out one of these forms and they
		file it in the book and if someone wants
		to meet you, they arrange it.

				KATHLEEN
		What a stupid way to meet someone.

				CHRISTINA
		Compared to the Internet?

				KATHLEEN
		My little thing on the Internet is just
		a lark.

				CHRISTINA
		So it's still going on?

				KATHLEEN
		And I do not plan to meet him.
			(indicating the book)
		Why do I get the feeling that you are in
		here somewhere?

	Christina flips the book open to her application.

				CHRISTINA
		I came in here one night and drank too
		much coffee and filled one out.
			(off Kathleen's look)
		Well how am I supposed to meet someone?

				KATHLEEN
		You are a runner.  Some day you will make
		eye contact with another runner and --

				CHRISTINA
		No one ever even looks at me.  They
		don't.  On top of which, who are they?
		They could like the symphony.  I could
		never fall in love with someone who 
		likes to go to the symphony --

				KATHLEEN
		I know.  What are you supposed to do
		there?

				CHRISTINA
		I don't know.

				KATHLEEN
		Sit.  You're supposed to sit.

				CHRISTINA
		I could never fall in love with anyone
		who smokes cigars either.

				KATHLEEN
		I'll tell you what I hate.  Big fat legs
		like stumps.

				CHRISTINA
		Yeah.  I hate that too.

				KATHLEEN
		The worst, the worst -- I could never,
		under any circumstances, love anybody
		who had a sailboat.

				CHRISTINA
		Neither could I.

				KATHLEEN
		If I had to get up on Saturday morning
		knowing that I was about to go down to
		the pier and unravel all those ropes and
		put on all that sunblock --

				CHRISTINA
		All that talk about the wind.

				KATHLEEN
		And then you have to go out on the boat,
		and you sail and sail and sail until you
		are bored witless, and then, only then,
		do they say, let's turn around and you
		realize the trip is only half over, only
		it's not, because the wind has changed --

				CHRISTINA
		It hasn't changed.  It's died.

				KATHLEEN
		So then there's more talk about the wind.
		While you just float up and down trying
		not to get nauseous.  And when you
		finally get back, you have to clean up
		the boat.

				CHRISTINA
		Why don't people have boat maids?

				KATHLEEN
		I know.  There're all these people who
		wouldn't be caught dead polishing a
		doorknob in their house but put them on 
		a boat and they want to rub down 
		everything in sight.
		
	EXT. 19TH STREET BOAT BASIN - ANOTHER DAY

	Joe is on his sailboat.  He is polishing his brass and
	whistling.

				ANNABEL
		Joe --

	Joe jumps off the boat onto the dock to greet his
	grandfather's daughter ANNABEL, 8, who is coming toward the
	dock with GILLIAN, his father's overdecorated 32-year-old
	fiance, her son, MATTHEW, 4, and the Nanny, MAUREEN.

				JOE
		Hello.
			(picks up Annabel)
		Annabel, how are you today?

				ANNABEL
		Great.

				JOE
			(picks up Matt)
		Hey, big guy --

				GILLIAN
		Don't I get a hello?

				JOE
		Hello, Gillian.

				GILLIAN
		Kiss me.  I'm going to be your wicked
		stepmother.

	Joe gives her a peck on the cheek.

				JOE
		Who is this?

				GILLIAN
		Nanny Maureen.  I brought her in case
		you couldn't handle the kids.

				ANNABEL
		Maureen's getting a divorce.

				JOE
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				MAUREEN
		It's my own fault.  Never marry a man
		who lies.

				JOE
		That is so wise.  Remember that, Annabel.

				ANNABEL
		She taught Matt to spell his name.

				MATT
		Fox. F-O-X.

				JOE
		Excellent, Matt.
			(to Maureen)
		Good work.  You can have the day off.
		I'll take over from here.
			(to Gillian)
		You must be late for something.
		Volunteer work at the Henry Street
		Settlement.  Packing bandages for
		Bosnian refugees.  A course in 
		Chinese literature at Columbia.

				GILLIAN
		I am.  I'm having my eggs harvested.

	EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY

	There's a block street fair with little booths, sausage
	sandwich concessions, etc.  Annabel and Matt have been to the
	makeup booth.  Annabel is a cat and Matt is a pirate.
	Annabel is carrying a goldfish in a baggie as they walk toward
	Broadway.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

	As Joe, Annabel and Matt walk past.  There's some sort of toy
	miniature princess in a pointed hat sitting outside the store
	and a sign lit with twinkle lights: Storybook Lady today 3:30.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

	Kathleen is sitting on a stool reading to a group of CHILDREN,
	including Annabel and Matt, who are crammed into her store.
	Joe is watching, along with some PARENTS as Kathleen reads 
	from a Roald Dahl book.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - LATER

	Matt is sitting on the floor reading a book.  Kathleen is 
	showing Annabel a copy of a book called Betsy-Tacy.

				KATHLEEN
		This is her best friend Tacy, whose real
		name is Anastasia, and then in the next
		book Betsy and Tacy become friends with
		Tib, whose real name, I am sorry to tell
		you, is Thelma.

	In another section of the store:

	George is showing Joe a first edition of Swiss Family
	Robinson from the glass case.

				GEORGE
		The illustrations are hand-tipped,
		which is why --

				JOE
		It costs so much.

				GEORGE
		It's why it's worth so much.

	Joe smiles and turns to see Kathleen and Annabel at a whole
	shelf of Betsy-Tacy books.

				ANNABEL
		I want all of them.

				KATHLEEN
		That might be an awful lot for your dad
		to buy at one time.

				ANNABEL
		My dad gets me all the books I want.

				KATHLEEN
			(looking over at Joe)
		Well, that's very nice of him.

				ANNABEL
		That's not my dad.  That's my nephew --

				KATHLEEN
		Oh, I don't really think that's your
		nephew --

	As Joe approaches.

				JOE
		It's true.  Annabel is my aunt.  Aren't
		you, Aunt Annabel?

	Annabel nods solemnly.

				ANNABEL
		And Matt is --

				KATHLEEN
		Let me guess.
			(to Matt)
		Are you his uncle?

				MATT
		No.

				KATHLEEN
		His grandfather?

	Annabel and Matt start giggling.

				KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		His great-grandfather?

				MATT
			(shouting with glee)
		I'm his brother.

				JOE
		Annabel is my grandfather's daughter.
		And Matt is my father's son.  We are an
		American family.

	He smiles at Kathleen, who finds herself smiling back.

	Annabel suddenly sneezes.

	Kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve.  It's an old
	fashioned hankie that's embroidered.  She offers it to
	Annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then
	looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled.

				ANNABEL
		What is that?

				KATHLEEN
		A handkerchief.  Oh my, do children not
		even know what handkerchiefs are?  A
		handkerchief is a Kleenex you don't throw
		away.  My mother embroidered it for me --
		you see?  My initials and a daisy, 
		because daisies are my favorite flower.

				ANNABEL
		Orchids are my favorite flower.

				KATHLEEN
			(to Joe)
		You know what else children don't know?
		They don't know what a telephone booth
		is?

	Joe is looking at Kathleen.

				JOE
		Who are you?

				KATHLEEN
		Kathleen Kelly.  I own this store.
		Are you are?

				JOE
		Joe.  Just call me Joe.
			(quickly)
		We'll take these books.

	He gets the one Matt is reading.  And the two other Kathleen
	has gotten for Annabel.

				KATHLEEN
		These are wonderful books.  As Annabel
		gets older the characters in the books do,
		too.
			(to Annabel)
		You can grow up with Betsy.

				GEORGE
		You're going to come back again, aren't
		you?

				JOE
		Of course.

				GEORGE
		This is why we're never going to go
		under.  Our customers are loyal.

				KATHLEEN
			(by way of explanation)
		They're opening a Foxbooks around the
		corner.

				ANNABEL
		Foxbooks!  My Daddy --

				JOE
			(gently putting his hand over
			 her mouth)
		-- likes to buy at discount.  Don't tell
		anyone that, Annabel, it's nothing to be
		proud of --

				MATT
			(spelling)
		F-O-X.

				KATHLEEN
		That's amazing.  You can spell fox.  Can
		you spell dog?

				MATT
		F-O-X.

			     JOE
		Matt, look at this dinosaur book.
		Wouldn't you like a dinosaur book?
		Annabel, maybe you could read this to
		Matt while I wrap things up here.
			(moves them to a corner, to
			 them quickly)
		Sit down, read, and don't listen to
		anything I say.

	Returns to counter and gives Kathleen some cash.

			     JOE
		And the dinosaur book too.

			     KATHLEEN
		The world is not driven by discounts,
		believe me.  I've been in business
		forever.  I started helping my mother
		here after school when I was six years
		old.  I used to watch her, and it wasn't
		that she was selling books, it was that
		she was helping people become whoever
		they were going to turn out to be.  When
		you read a book as a child it becomes
		part of your identity in a way that no
		other reading in your life does.
			(stops herself)
		I guess I've gotten carried away.

			     JOE
		You have, and you've made me feel...

	He can't finish the sentence.  He looks at her and sees,
	behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is
	unmistakably Kathleen's mother, with a young Kathleen.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Enchanting, your mother was enchanting.

			     KATHLEEN
		She was.  How did you know that?

			     JOE
		Lucky guess.

			     KATHLEEN
		Anyway.  She left the store to me, and
		I'm going to leave it to my daughter.

			     JOE
		How old is your daughter now?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, I'm not married.  But eventually.

	She smiles at Joe...

			     KATHLEEN
		So Foxbooks can...

			     KATHLEEN AND GEORGE TOGETHER
		Go to hell.

			     KATHLEEN
			(handing him his books)
		Here you go.

			     JOE
		We ready?

	Annabel and Matt join him at the counter.  Kathleen gives them
	each a lollipop.

			     ANNABEL
		Bye, Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Goodbye, Annabel.  Bye, Matt.  What
		about cat?  Can you spell cat?

			     MATT
		F-O-X.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Someplace like the auditorium at the Museum of Broadcasting.
	PATRICIA EDEN, Joe's girlfriend, who is the editor-in-chief
	of a New York publishing house called Eden Books, is standing
	at a podium at a sales conference.  In the audience are sales
	reps, wholesalers, etc.  There's a screen behind her with
	pictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		And now, the book you've all been waiting
		for, the book it's been my dreams to
		publish.  The legendary Veronica Grant
		has written her memoirs --

	There's a burst of applause as a photograph of Veronica Grant
	flashes on screen.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		-- and I'm happy to report it is just
		crammed with tragedy.
			(she laughs gaily)
		Just kidding, but seriously, it's all
		here: poverty, addiction, divorce,
		tracheotomies --

	We see pictures of Veronica at eight with her sharecropper
	family, Veronica at 14 with her first child, Veronica with a
	series of husbands, Veronica in a wheelchair, etc.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		-- her third husband beat her up, hip
		replacement, and an amazing face lift
		where all the injected fat fell to her
		chin.

	Now we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of
	Veronica on it and the title: "Am I Rising from Ashes, or Did
	I Just Forget to Dust?"

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		This book is fabulous.  And even if it
		weren't, it would sell like crazy,
		because Veronica is going to plug it to
		death on every talk show in America.
		This book...

	Patricia bursts into tears.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		I'm sorry.  I can't talk about it without
		crying.  Veronica and I have so much in
		common -- well, not all the sad parts --
		but we were both famous by the time we
		were 29 and, believe me, that's rough.
			(wipes her nose with a Kleenex,
			 pulling herself together)
		Anyway, I just want to say that I'm
		especially thrilled to be publishing it.
		Veronica lives in my building and we met
		in the elevator.  By the time we had
		traveled from the eighth floor to the
		first, we had a deal.  First printing:
		one million copies.

	Everyone applauds enthusiastically.

	INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - A SHORT WHILE LATER

	Patricia is leaving, still surrounded by colleagues and sales
	reps congratulating her.  She is the soul of graciousness.
	Her assistant, Sarah, comes up.

			     SARAH
			(quickly)
		You have a dentist appointment in twenty 
		minutes.  So you should leave soon...

			     PATRICIA
		What's my car number?

			     SARAH
		Car?  You didn't say anything about a car
		--

			     PATRICIA
		Are you an idiot?  Of course I need a car.
		God!

	She walks toward the exit.

	EXT. 57TH STREET - CONTINUOUS

	Patricia in the pouring rain, trying to hail a cab.  She
	spots one across the street.

			     PATRICIA
		Taxi!  Taxi!  Taxi!

	She whistles -- a longshoreman's whistle.

	The cab makes a U-turn, but instead of stopping for Patricia
	it stops about twenty feet ahead for a MAN in an overcoat who
	gets into it.

			     PATRICIA
		Excuse me -- what are you doing?  This is
		my taxicab.
			(to the driver)
		Don't take him.  I am telling you right
		now, and I am memorizing your number,
		don't take him.
			(to the man)
		Who the fuck do you think you are?

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Are you going uptown?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Get in.  I'll drop you.

	INT. TAXI - A MINUTE LATER

	As the cab turns onto Eighth Avenue, starts uptown.

	Patricia is dialing her cell phone.  She's elaborately
	ignoring the man who stole her cab.

			     PATRICIA
		Veronica, it's Patricia, you should have
		been there, it was unbelievable, we're
		going to sell truckloads of your book.
		Call me.

	She hangs up, folds up the phone, puts it back in her purse
	as the cab moves on.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Are you an editor?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		I am a rabbi.

			     PATRICIA
		Oh, my God, I said fuck to a rabbi.  I'm
		sorry.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		I hope you don't mind my asking, but are
		you Jewish?

			     PATRICIA
		Yes.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		You should come to our temple.

			     PATRICIA
		I'm not really religious.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Oh, I am surprised, you seem like a very
		religious person.

			     PATRICIA
		You're kidding, right?

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		We are at West End Avenue and 83rd
		Street.  Every Friday night, we have a
		joyous time, everyone dancing, everyone
		singing.  Also some wisdom.  Perhaps you
		have heard of us, we are known as The
		Singles Temple.

	He smiles at her.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		It's a very good place to calm down.

	The cab stops.

			     MAN IN OVERCOAT
		Oh, look, I am already here.  Very nice
		to meet you.
			(gives the cabbie money)
		Take this woman to her destination.

	He gets out.  Closes the door.  A beat too late:

			     PATRICIA
		Goodbye.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Frank comes up the stoop.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Kathleen is dressed up for a party.

	Frank walks in, looks meaningfully at her.

			     FRANK
		I saw him.  I actually saw him.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     FRANK
		I can't believe it.  I saw William
		Spungeon.

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought he was in Mexico.

			     FRANK
		Maybe he's in Mexico, but today he was in
		New York.  The most brilliant and
		reclusive novelist in the history of the
		world is here, in this neighborhood.  He
		may be living on this very block.

			     KATHLEEN
		Where did you see him?

			     FRANK
		I was on the subway --

	INT. SUBWAY - DAY

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		-- and this musician got onto the train --

	Frank is sitting on the subway, reading the Village Voice.
	The door between the cars opens and a man playing the 
	clarinet enters the car.

	No one looks up except Frank.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		-- and I suddenly saw him, sitting
		directly across from me doing the
		crossword puzzle.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		How'd you know it was him?

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He looked exactly the same as his high
		school yearbook picture, which happens to
		be the last photograph ever taken of him.

	Frank takes out his billfold on the subway, pulls out a piece
	of paper.

	CLOSE UP - FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER

	As Frank unfolds a newspaper clipping of a yearbook picture
	of William Spungeon at 17.

	Frank compares the photo of Spungeon with the person sitting
	across the way.  They don't look remotely alike except that
	the boy in the picture and the man on the subway are both
	wearing the same style glasses.

	The subway stops at 79th Street, and William Spungeon gets off.
	Frank follows.

	EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Frank comes out of the subway station and looks around.

			     FRANK
		So I followed him.

	Frank sees Spungeon cross 79th.  He follows.

	EXT. H&H BAGELS - CONTINUOUS

	Frank follows Spungeon, who hurries into H&H Bagels passing a
	HOMELESS MAN holding a paper cup at the door.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He went into H&H and bought a bagel
		with everything.

	EXT. H&H BAGELS - A MINUTE LATER

	As Spungeon leaves the store, passing the paper cup, which we
	now realize that Frank, in dark glasses, is holding.

	Spungeon drops his newspaper in a garbage container.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		He dropped his crossword into the 
		garbage and I rescued it.

	Frank plucks the puzzle from the trashcan, follows Spungeon.

	INT. SPORTING GOOD STORE - CONTINUOUS

	Spungeon at the counter in the shoe store.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		Then he went into a sporting good store
		and bought tube socks, 6 pair for $7.99.

	We see Frank, peeking out at him from behind a stack of
	running pants.  Suddenly he's distracted by a couple of
	joggers.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		William Spungeon and tube socks.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		I know.  I don't want to dwell on it.

	Frank looks back at the counter.  Spungeon's gone.

			     FRANK (V.O.)
		And then I lost him.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

	Frank waves the crossword puzzle in front of Kathleen.

			     FRANK
		Do you know what this is worth?

	He takes an empty instant-frame from the closet, puts the
	puzzle into it and sets it next to the typewriters.

	INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As the two of them eat dinner.

			     FRANK
		What I was thinking as I was trailing him
		was that eventually I would have the
		courage to say hello to him, you know,
		not in a horrible, intrusive or slavering
		fan-slash-acolyte kind of way, but more
		like, "Hi."  "How ya doing?"  "Have you
		ever thought about trading up in the sock
		area?"  "Who knows, maybe he's read my
		work -- and then we'd become friends, and
		eventually I'd introduce him to you --
		you know how much he loves children's
		books, there's a whole long section in
		Relativity's Smile about The Wizard of Oz
		-- and then maybe he'd come out of hiding
		so he could help save the store.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you talking about?

			     FRANK
		From Foxbooks.  I mean, if things got
		tough, he could help rally support --

			     KATHLEEN
		It's never going to get to that.  The
		store is fine.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	As they walk along after dinner.

			     FRANK
		I don't even know why you would say that?

			     KATHLEEN
		Neither do I.  It just flew out of my
		mouth.

			     FRANK
		There's enough business for us all.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	As they go up in an elevator.

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, we're fine.

			     FRANK
		You're more than fine, you're absolutely
		fine.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're fine.

	The elevator opens onto:

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A publication party for an author named VINCE MANCINI.  A mix
	of book people, journalists and various other media folk.

			     FRANK
		Hey, Vince.  Congratulations.  You know
		Kathleen Kelly.

			     VINCE
		How are you?

			     FRANK
		Guess who I saw today on the subway?
		William Spungeon.

			     VINCE
		I thought he was in Mexico.

	They start chatting.

	Across the room, Joe is with Patricia, who is telling two
	other people the story of meeting the rabbi in the taxicab.
	Joe looks over and sees Kathleen.  He suddenly looks
	stricken.

	Shifts his position so Kathleen can't see his face, but
	sneaks a look.

			     PATRICIA
		Would you get me another drink, sweetie?
		I'm all out.
			(continues chattering)
		So then the rabbi says, "It's a very good
		place to calm down."  Isn't that
		hysterical?

	They all laugh.  Joe moves over to the bar.

			     JOE
		Absolut on the rocks.

	As he is waiting, Kathleen comes up next to him.

			     KATHLEEN
		A white wine, please.
			(very friendly)
		Oh, hello.

			     JOE
		Hi.

			     KATHLEEN
		Remember me, from the bookstore?

			     JOE
		Of course I remember you.

			     KATHLEEN
		How's your aunt?

			     JOE
		Good.  She's good.
			(gets his drink)
		I have to deliver this.  I have a very
		thirsty date.  She's part camel.

	Kathleen laughs.

			     KATHLEEN
		Joe.  It's Joe, isn't it?

			     JOE
		And you're Kathleen.

	Joe vanishes into the party.

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - A MINUTE LATER

			     VINCE
		I can't believe you were talking to Joe
		Fox.

			     KATHLEEN
		Joe Fox?  As in --

	She can't even finish the sentence.

	INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER

	Joe is standing at a table of food, his back to the room.

			     KATHLEEN
		Fox?  Your last name is Fox?

	Joe spins around, looks at her.

			     JOE
		F-O-X.

			     KATHLEEN
		God, I didn't realize.  I didn't know who
		you --
			(she trails off)

			     JOE
		-- were with.
			(quoting)
		"I didn't know who you were with."

			     KATHLEEN
		Excuse me?

			     JOE
		It's from the Godfather.  When the movie
		producer realizes that Tom Hagen is the
		emissary of Vito Corleone --
			(continued)

	Kathleen is staring at him.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		-- just before the horse's head ends up
		in his bed never mind --

			     KATHLEEN
		You were spying on me, weren't you?  You
		probably rented those children.

			     JOE
		Why would I spy on you?

			     KATHLEEN
		I am your competition.  Which you know
		perfectly well or you would not have put
		up that sign saying "Just around the
		Corner."

			     JOE
		The entrance to our store is around the
		corner.  There is no other way to say it.
		It's not the name of our store, it's
		where it is.  You don't own "around the
		corner."

			     KATHLEEN
		Next thing you'll be using twinkle
		lights.

			     JOE
		Twinkle lights?

			     KATHLEEN
		Little white Christmas lights that
		twinkle.  I use them in my window and on
		all my displays, as if you didn't notice.

			     JOE
		Look, the reason I came into your store
		is that I was spending the day with
		Annabel and Matt.  I like to buy them a
		present when I see them because I'm one
		of those guys who likes to buy his way
		into the hearts of children who are his
		relatives.  There was only one place to
		buy children's books in the neighborhood
		-- although that will not always be the
		case, and it was yours, and it is a
		charming little bookstore.  You probably
		sell $250,000 worth of book a year --

			     KATHLEEN
		How do you know that?

			     JOE
		I'm in the book business.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm in the book business --

			     JOE
		Oh, I see, and we're the Price Club.
		Only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive
		oil for $3.99 that won't even fit into
		your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap
		books.  Me a spy.
			(beat)
		Absolutely.  And I managed to get my hands
		on a secret printout of the sales figures
		of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet
		full of its own virtue that I was instantly
		compelled to rush over and check it out
		for fear it would drive me out of business 
		--

	Kathleen stares at him.  She's speechless.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		What?
			(off her look)
		What?

	Kathleen shakes her head.

	Frank turns up.

			     FRANK
		Hi.  I'm Frank Navasky --

			     JOE
		-- Joe Fox.

			     FRANK
		Joe Fox?  Inventor of the Superstore,
		enemy of the mid-list novel, destroyer of
		City Books -- tell me something:
		How do you sleep at night?

	Patricia joins them.

			     PATRICIA
		I use a wonderful over-the-counter drug,
		Ultrasom.  Don't take the whole thing,
		just half, and you will wake up without
		even that tiniest hangover.  You're Frank
		Navasky, aren't you?

			     FRANK
		Yes.

			     PATRICIA
		Your last piece in the Independent, the
		one about Anthony Powell, was brilliant.
		I'm Patricia Eden, Eden Books.  Joe, this
		man is the greatest living expert on
		Julius and Ethel Rosenberg --

			     JOE
		And this is Kathleen Kelly --

	Kathleen glares at him.

			     FRANK
		You liked my piece.  God, I'm flattered.
		You know you write these things and you
		think someone's going to mention them and
		then the whole week goes by and the phone
		doesn't ring, and you think Oh, God, I'm
		a fraud, a failure --

			     PATRICIA
		You know what's always fascinated me
		about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg is how
		old they looked when they were really
		just our age.

	Everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at
	Patricia, who smiles at them all.

			     PATRICIA
			(to Frank)
		I'm so happy to have finally met you.  We
		will talk.  Have you ever thought about
		doing a book?

			     FRANK
		Oh sure, it's passed through my head.
		Something really relevant for today like
		the Luddite movement in 19th century
		England.

	At the same time:

			     JOE
		Patricia --

			     KATHLEEN
		Frank --

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As Kathleen and Frank get into bed.

			     FRANK
		I really like Patricia Eden.  She's a
		very nice person.

	Kathleen doesn't respond.  Frank turns out the light.

			     FRANK
		She needs educating, that's all.

	A beat.

			     FRANK
		She's hopelessly driven by money and
		power, but there's a hope for anyone 
		who's that familiar with my work --

	On Kathleen, as she turns away from Frank and lies there,
	eyes open.

	INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As Joe and Patricia get into bed.  Brinkley is already on the
	bed.

			     PATRICIA
		I had no idea that Frank Navasky was so
		down-to-earth.

	Joe doesn't respond.  Patricia turns out the light.

			     PATRICIA
		You read his stuff, you think he's going
		to be so obscure and abstruse.

	A beat.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		He's always talking about Heidigger and
		Foucault and I have no idea what any of
		it's about, really.

	Joe gets up.  Brinkley follows.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		Where are you going?

			     JOE
		I'm not really tired.

	INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	Joe writes on his computer.  Brinkley on the floor next to him.

	And cut between Joe and his computer screen.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Do you ever feel you become the worst
		version of yourself?  That a Pandora's
		Box of all the secret hateful parts --
		your arrogance, your spite, your
		condescension -- has sprung open.
		Someone provokes you, and instead of 
		just smiling and moving on, you zing 
		them.  Hello, it's Mr. Nasty.  I'm sure 
		you have no idea what I'm talking about.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

	And cut between screen and

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	As Kathleen reads the end of Joe's letter.

	Kathleen hits the Reply key and starts to type:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I know what you mean and I'm completely
		jealous.  What happens to me when I'm
		provoked is that I get tongue-tied.  My
		mind goes blank.  Then I spend all night
		tossing and turning trying to think of
		what I should have said.

	INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	As he replies:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could pass
		all my zingers to you and then I would
		never behave badly and you could behave
		badly all the time and we'd both be
		happy?  On the other hand, I must warn
		you that when you finally have the
		pleasure of saying the thing you mean to
		say at the moment you mean to say it,
		remorse inevitably follows.  Do you think
		we should meet?

	INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen stares at Joe's letter in her computer.

	She's frozen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Meet?  Omigod.

	She sits staring at the letter.  She has no idea what to do.

	EXT. 75TH STREET & COLUMBUS - DAY

	As the iron gates on all the stores start to open, just the
	way we saw them open in the opening sequence of the movie.
	The pharmacy.  The optician.  The cosmetics supply store.
	The video store.

	And now, finally, we see the new grate on the new Foxbooks
	Superstore start to open upwards.  This is the finest grate
	on Broadway, no question of it.  It's electric and almost
	soundless.  We see a sign saying, OPENING DAY.  35% OFF ON
	ALL BEST-SELLERS.

	People on the street notice the store.  One walks in...

	CAMERA follows him...

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	The inside is beautiful.  Gleaning staircase, a cafe,
	comfortable chairs to sit, a bank of cashiers, everyone
	decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the
	alligator should be, a rope for the checkout line, and seven
	cash registers with seven cashiers.  Of course, books, books,
	books, as far as the eye can see.

	MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SAME SCENE - LATER THAT DAY

	The store is jam-packed.  Joe with his father Nelson, his
	grandfather Schuyler, and Kevin, the store manager.

			     JOE
		No pickets, no demonstrations.

			     KEVIN
		The neighborhood loves us.

			     NELSON
		They're wondering where we've been all
		these years.  They're wondering how they
		ever did without it.

			     SCHUYLER
		It's a hit.

	They admire their own store, walk through the downstairs and
	start up the staircase to the second floor.

			     NELSON
		How's the children's book department?

			     JOE
		It's early yet.  School isn't out.  And
		there's that children's bookstore nearby
		--

			     SCHUYLER
		Cecilia's store --

			     JOE
		Her daughter's --

			     NELSON
		We'll crush it --

			     SCHUYLER
		She was enchanting.

	And as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children
	come up the stairs behind them.

	EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

	A little group of children dressed as Pilgrims walk down the
	street as Kathleen comes around the corner to buy her morning
	paper.  Joe is at the newsstand.  She turns and pretends to
	be staring at a wall until he finishes buying his paper and
	walks on.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I don't think it's a good idea for us
		to meet...

	INT. STARBUCKS - ANOTHER DAY

	Joe is putting sugar into his coffee at the sugar counter as
	Kathleen comes in.  He pretends he didn't see her.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		I love our relationship.  There's a lot
		going on in the day-to-dayness of my life
		and there's something magical...

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	We see Kathleen and George at the end of the day, counting
	the receipts.  Birdie is using a calculator to total them.
	Christina is shelving books.  There are Thanksgiving
	decorations -- cardboard turkeys and pilgrims, books on
	colonists like Myles Standish.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		... and thrilling about this island in
		cyberspace I have with you.  SO PLEASE
		DON'T ASK ME AGAIN.

			     BIRDIE
		About $1200 less than the same week last
		year.

			     KATHLEEN
		That could be a fluke, right?

	They look at each other.

			     BIRDIE
		Or not.

			     KATHLEEN
		Their store is new.  It's a novelty.  But
		it will all shake out.  Do you think I
		should put up more twinkle lights?

			     BIRDIE
		That's a lovely idea.

			     CHRISTINA
		What if we have to fold?  I'll never find
		another part time job and I won't be able
		to pay the rent and I'll have to move to
		Brooklyn.

			     GEORGE
		The joy of rent control.  Six room for
		$450 a month.

			     CHRISTINA
		We know.  You've told us a million times.
		I can't believe you're bringing it up at
		a time like this.  It's like bragging
		because you're tall.  Birdie never brags
		about her rent and she pays even less
		than you.

			     BIRDIE
		Ten rooms.  I just rattle around from one
		to the other.

			     KATHLEEN
		Hey, guys.  We are not going to fold.

	The door opens, and Meredith Carter, the woman George had
	swooned over in front of his building, walks in.

	George stares, frozen in place, as she walks up to him.

			     MEREDITH
		George Pappas?

			     GEORGE
			(I have died and gone to
			 heaven)
		Yes.

			     MEREDITH
			(flashing her badge)
		Detective Carter, 23rd precinct.  I'd
		like to ask you a few questions.

	Kathleen suddenly sees George, following Meredith out of the
	store.  He's in a complete daze.

			     KATHLEEN
		George?  Where are you going?

	He goes out the door.

	LAURA MARGULIES, a well-known children's book author, enters
	as George leaves.

			     LAURA
		Kathleen, are you surviving?

			     KATHLEEN
		Laura!  We're so excited about your new
		book.  When should we schedule your
		signing?

			     LAURA
		Oh, it's being published in January.
		Are you going to be in business in
		January?  I'm so worried.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're doing great, aren't we?

			     CHRISTINA
		Great.

			     BIRDIE
		No difference whatsoever.

			     LAURA
		Thank God.  Well, you know you can count
		on me.  For anything, support, rallies.
		Picket lines.  We can get the Times to
		write something.  Or that nut in the
		Independent --

			     KATHLEEN
		What nut in the Independent?

			     LAURA
		Frank Navasky.  This is just the sort of
		thing that would outrage him.

	She smiles brightly.

	INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

	George and Meredith are sitting in a booth.

			     MEREDITH
		Mr. Pappas, I'm investigating the murder
		of the woman found on the roof of your
		building.  Do you live alone there?

			     GEORGE
		Do I live alone?  Yes I do.  Do you live
		alone?

			     MEREDITH
		Yes.

	George takes her hand in his and looks at it as if it were
	the eighth wonder of the world.  He starts stroking it,
	caressing it...

	Meredith pulls it away.  A beat.  Then she gives it right
	back to him.  He continues stroking.  They stare at each
	other.  He puts her fingers into his mouth.

		MEREDITH
			(overwhelmed)
		What are you doing?

			     GEORGE
		I don't know.  I have no idea.

			     MEREDITH
		You have to stop.

			     GEORGE
		I can't.

	She utters a little moan.

	INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT - A SHORT WHILE LATER

	They come into the apartment.  She throws herself into his
	arms.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - DAY

	As Christina runs, desperately trying to make eye contact
	with men running in the opposite direction.  No one will look
	at her.

	INT. ZABAR'S CHEESE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

	The place is mobbed -- the usual crush the night before
	Thanksgiving.

	Kathleen, pushing a shopping cart, is trying to wedge her way
	through the crowd in the cheese department.  As she reaches
	across three people to grab some Brie, she sees Joe walk into
	the store.  Quickly, she turns her back so he can't see her.
	She stands there frozen.  A beat...

	Peeks around, doesn't see him anywhere.  Cranes her neck this
	way and that.  No Joe.

	INT. ZABAR'S CASHIER AREA - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen, now wearing dark glasses but looking not at all
	disguised, looks around and spots a short line and makes a
	beeline for it.

	At that moment, Joe comes from the Appetizing Department and
	gets on the line she was heading for.

	Panicked, Kathleen retreats onto another line and stands with
	her back to him.

	INT. SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

	The CASHIER totals up Kathleen's purchases and Kathleen hands
	over her credit card.

			     CASHIER
		This is a Cash Only line.

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     CASHIER
		Cash Only.

			     KATHLEEN
		Omigod, I only have a credit card.  Is
		that okay?

			     PERSON BEHIND HER IN LINE
		Of course it's not okay, there's a sign.

			     CASHIER
		There's a sign.

			     PERSON IN LINE
			(to the person behind her)
		She doesn't have cash.

	"She doesn't have cash" is repeated all the way down the
	line.

	Joe turns to see what's going on.

			     ANOTHER PERSON
		Get on another line, lady.

			     JOE
		Oh, hello.

			     KATHLEEN
		Hello.

			     JOE
		Do you need some money?

			     KATHLEEN
		No, I don't need any money.  Thank you
		very much.

			     CASHIER
		Get on another line.

			     JOE
		Hi.
			(off her nametag, big smile)
		Rose. Great name.  Rose, this is
		Kathleen, I'm Joe, and this is a credit
		card machine.  Happy Thanksgiving.

	Rose just stares at him.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Now it's your turn to say happy
		Thanksgiving back.

			     ROSE
		Happy Thanksgiving back.

	Joe looks at her, winks.

			     JOE
		Mississippi is a hard word to spell.  How
		do you spell it?  I-T.
			(big smile)
		Now take this credit card and put it
		through the machine, zip zip.

	The cashier, completely charmed, takes Kathleen's credit
	card.

	Kathleen is appalled.

	Everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly.

			     JOE
		So you're fine.

			     KATHLEEN
		Fine.

			     JOE
		Happy Thanksgiving.

	As Kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly
	starts to put her groceries into a bag.

	INT. JOE'S FATHER'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING DAY

	An elegant East Side apartment.  Schuyler, his youngish
	French wife, YVETTE, Nelson, Gillian and their child Matt,
	and Joe are sitting and listening as Annabel sings Tomorrow.

			     ANNABEL
		The sun'll come up tomorrow, bet your
		bottom dollar that tomorrow, there'll be
		sun --

	Joe is on a loveseat with Matt.  Gillian lifts Matt up, sits
	down in his place next to Joe and plunks Matt into her lap.
	Nelson is already seated in a chair in front of the loveseat
	and can't see her without turning around.

	As she continues singing, Gillian moves her hand next to
	Joe's leg.  Joe edges away.  He looks around the room, sees
	Nanny Maureen standing behind the couch.  He stands, offers
	her his seat.  She sits.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	A much more informal Thanksgiving dinner. We see the
	leftovers on a sideboard near a round table in Kathleen's
	living room.

	Kathleen, Frank, Birdie, Christina, George and George's new
	girlfriend, Meredith and TWO OTHER FRIENDS are standing
	around the upright piano.  Birdie is playing a Christmas
	song, and everyone is singing.

	As the singing continues, over, we cut to:

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DECEMBER DAY

	As the Christmas decorations and twinkle lights go into the
	window.

	Birdie walks by the store.  She stops to look at the
	customers inside, and then notices a sign in the window:

	"Book Signing January 10 - Best Selling Children's Author
	Laura Margulies."  There's a picture of Laura Margulies.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DECEMBER DUSK

	Kathleen is in the window decorating a little tree with
	lovely decorations from a box.  Two people are carrying a
	tree home, there's the sound of church bells.

	Kathleen looks up as a couple of people walk past the store,
	carrying Foxbooks shopping bags.

	Then she unwraps a pair of ruby slipper ornaments, and as she
	starts to hang them on the tree we hear the sound of the
	computer.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		This is such an odd Christmas.  I find
		myself missing my mother, who's been dead
		for ten years.  New York at Christmas is
		so loaded with all the things we used to
		do --

	INT. NEW YORK STATE THEATER - 1972 - DAY

	As Young Kathleen, dressed in a little velvet dress, sits in
	the audience next to her mother watching the ballet.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)
		-- going to the Nutcracker --

	EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - 1972 - DAY

			     KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)
		-- ice skating at Rockefeller Center,
		where I was knocked into a 6-year-old
		maniac --

	A SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY knocks into her.

			     YOUNG KATHLEEN
		Hey, watch out --

			     SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY
		Me watch out, why don't you watch out?
		I'm not sliding around like a baby.  You
		think I come here to skate with babies?

	Young Kathleen's jaw drops and she stands there tongue-tied.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My first experience as a speechless
		person.

	Her mother skates up and takes her hand.  The boy skates off.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I always miss my mother at Christmas, but
		somehow it's worse this year since I need
		some advice from her.

	And we hear the sound of another computer.

	INT. JOE'S DEN

	As he replies to Kathleen.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		My mother took me ice skating too --

	EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - DAY

	We see a little boy, YOUNG JOE, 8, skate past holding someone's
	hand --

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		-- although my mother did not skate.  The
		nanny skated --

	And we now see JOE'S NANNY, a young Sonja Henie, who suddenly
	peels off into a series of triple lutzes, as JOE'S MOTHER
	absently reads a copy of Vogue in the spectators' section.

	INT. LINCOLN CENTER THEATER - 1972 - DAY

			     JOE (V.O.)
		And I was in the Nutcracker.

	We see the stage now.  There's Young Joe, among the children
	at the Christmas party.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		So was my nanny.

	As JOE'S NANNY #2 pirouettes past.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Different nanny.  By the way, I'm
		surprised you aren't a writer.  Although
		you probably are a writer and don't
		know it.  Are you a writer and I don't 
		know it?

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - 1972 - NIGHT

	Young Joe, at the dinner table with his father.  A wide shot
	of a big room with a huge table and servants.  Joe looks very
	small at the table as he eats his soup.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		My mother died when I was ten.  I was
		staying with my father, who is not famous
		for intimacy, and whose way of breaking
		the news of her death was to tell me she
		would not be coming to pick me up as
		usual.  It was a car accident, and I
		don't know where she was going or who she
		was with, and I assume what I owe her is
		my tendency to cover almost any emotion
		with a joke.  A useful gift, unless you
		want to know what you're feeling.  She
		was very beautiful.  People toss that
		word around a lot, but my mother was.

	The camera moves closer to the dining table.  We see that
	tears are rolling down little Joe's cheeks.

	INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

	Joe stops typing.  He is surprised to find his eyes watering.
	A moment of confusion as he cannot believe he has moved
	himself to tears.  Shakes his head, shakes the emotion off.
	Starts typing again.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Ancient history.  So what kind of advice
		do you need?  Can I help?

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen in bed with her laptop reading Joe's letter.

	She starts to type a response.

	Suddenly there's harp arpeggio and an Instant Message
	flashes on screen.

	From NY 152

	CLOSE ON KATHLEEN - TOTAL SHOCK

	ON SCREEN AS WE SEE THE MESSAGE

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I had a gut feeling you would be on line
		now.

	INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Joe is in bed with his laptop.  And cut back and forth
	between them and their computer screens as they type Instant
	Messages to one another.  Possible split screens.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		I can give you advice.  I'm great at
		advice.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I don't think you can help.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Is it about love?

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My business is in trouble.  My mother
		would have something wise to say.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm a brilliant businessman.  It's what
		I do best.  What's your business?

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		No specifics, remember?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Minus specifics, it's hard to help.
		Except to say, go to the mattresses.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		What?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		It's from The Godfather.  It means you
		have to go to war.

	CLOSE ON KATHLEEN - LOOKING AT THE COMPUTER

			     KATHLEEN
			(to herself)
		The Godfather?

	She starts to type.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		What is it with men and The Godfather?

			     JOE (V.O.)
		The Godfather is the I Ching.  The
		Godfather is the sum of all wisdom.  The
		Godfather is the answer to any question.
		What should I pack for my summer
		vacation?  "Leave the gun, take the
		cannoli."  What day of the week is it?
		"Maunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday."
		And the answer to your question is "Go to
		the mattresses."
			(continued)

	CAMERA ON KATHLEEN - CONSIDERING WHAT HE SAYS

			     JOE (cont'd)
		You're at war.  "It's not personal, it's
		business.  It's not personal it's
		business."  Recite that to yourself every
		time you feel you're losing your nerve.
		I know you worry about being brave, this
		is your chance.  Fight.  Fight to the
		death.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Patricia comes in as Joe is waiting for Kathleen's response.

			     PATRICIA
		Look what I bought.

	Joe types "Ciao" and signs off.  Looks up to see Patricia
	showing him a Plexiglas menorah.

			     PATRICIA
		I was just passing this store on Columbus
		Avenue and it caught my eye.

			     JOE
		What is it?

			     PATRICIA
		A Menorah.
			     JOE
		It doesn't look like a Menorah.

			     PATRICIA
		I know.  I don't know what came over me.
		I don't even celebrate Hanukkah.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	As Kathleen logs off, Frank comes in.

			     KATHLEEN
		Frank, I've decided to go to the
		mattresses.  Do you think it would be a
		gigantic conflict of interest if you
		wrote something about us?

	INT. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	It's January.  The store is more crowded than we've seen it.
	Frank is there with several copies of the Independent.  The
	phone is ringing off the hook.  Christina and George are
	fielding calls.  Birdie is reading Frank's article.

			     BIRDIE
			(reading)
		"Kathleen Kelly and her mother Cecilia
		Kelly have raised your children.  If this
		precious resource is killed by the cold
		cash cow of Foxbooks, it will not only be
		the end of Western civilization as we
		know it, but the end of something even
		dearer: our neighborhood as we know it.
		Save the Shop Around the Corner and you
		will save your own soul."  Frank, that's
		charming.

			     FRANK
		You think it's a little over the top?

			     BIRDIE
		Just say thank you.

			     FRANK
		Thank you.

			     CHRISTINA
			(calling to Kathleen)
		Channel 2's outside.

	INT. BACK ROOM - THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - SAME TIME

	Kathleen is primping in a tiny wall mirror.  She takes a deep
	breath.

			     KATHLEEN
		In a second.

			     GEORGE
			(from the other room)
		The Village Voice is coming.

			     KATHLEEN
		Omigod.

	Frank sticks his head in.

			     FRANK
			(in shock)
		It's him.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     FRANK
		God. It is God.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen comes out of the storage room.

	William Spungeon is standing there.

			     WILLIAM SPUNGEON
		I'm William Spungeon.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm very pleased to meet you.  I'm
		Kathleen Kelly.

	Frank is practically levitating.

			     SPUNGEON
		I knew your mother.  Although she knew me
		only as W.  That enormous bookstore is
		obscene.

			     FRANK
		I'm Frank Navasky.  I carry your picture
		in my wallet.

	He pulls it out.  Spungeon looks at him like he's crazy.

			     KATHLEEN
		We've organized pickets.  Channel 13 is
		doing a special.

			     SPUNGEON
		I'd be glad to talk to the press if it's
		all right with you.  They've been trying
		to interview me for years.

			     FRANK
		The press?  I'm the press.

			     KATHLEEN
		You'd allow that?  For me?  For the
		store?  That's incredible.  Although you
		wouldn't have to be photographed.  I
		respect that.  If it's television, they
		could just put one of those blurry dots
		in front of your face.

			     SPUNGEON
		No television.

			     CHRISTINA
			(referring to the TV crew)
		They're waiting for you --

			     FRANK
		I know all your books.  Phaelox the
		gnome, the little man who comes from
		nowhere... and is going nowhere...
			(quoting)
		"Where did you come from?"  "Nowhere."
		"Where are you going?"  "Nowhere."

			     SPUNGEON
		Cool it.  I'm starting to break out in
		hives.
			(to Kathleen)
		Here's my phone number.

			     KATHLEEN
		I had no idea William Spugeon had a
		phone.

			     SPUNGEON
		Adios.

	He gives a little wave and leaves.

			     FRANK
		This is historic.
			(beat)
		Do you realize what I've done?  By
		writing that piece, do you realize?
		I've brought William Spungeon in from
		the cold. Holy shit.  I am completely
		amazing.

	At that moment a TV REPORTER sticks her head into the store.

			     TV REPORTER
		Kathleen Kelly?

	Kathleen takes a deep breath, walks out the door.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		Are you ready, Miss Kelly?

			     KATHLEEN
		Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		What?

			     KATHLEEN
		Never mind.  I'm ready.  Shoot.

	INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - THAT NIGHT

			     CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
		We're here in front of the Shop Around
		the Corner, the famous West Side
		children's bookstore now on the verge of
		having to close its doors because the big
		bad wolf, Foxbooks, has opened only a few
		hundred feet away, wooing customers with
		its sharp discounts and designer coffee.

			     KATHLEEN
		They have to have discounts and lattes,
		because most of the people who work there
		have never read a book.

	And pull back now to reveal that we're in:

	INT. GYM - NIGHT

	Five TV sets are on, over adjoining treadmills, Joe and
	Kevin are on two of the treadmills, walking and watching.

			     JOE
		She's not as nice as she seems on
		television.

			     KEVIN
		You've met her?

			     JOE
		She's kind of a pill.

			     KEVIN
		She's probably not as attractive as she
		seems on television either.

			     JOE
		No, she's beautiful.  But a pill.

			     KEVIN
		So you don't feel bad about basically
		destroying her livelihood not to mention
		her legacy not to mention her raison
		d'etre.

			     JOE
		It's not personal --

			     KEVIN
		It's business.

			     JOE
		Right.  Exactly.

	They look up at the television.

	INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - CONTINUOUS

	Joe onscreen, with a super: Joe Fox, Vice-President Foxbooks.

			     JOE
		I sell cheap books.  Sue me.  I sell
		cheap books, and as a result -- listen 
		to this, because it's really bad --
		more people can buy books.

	The show immediately cuts back to the newscaster.

	On Joe and Kevin.

			     KEVIN
		That's what you said?

			     JOE
			(outraged)
		That's not all I said.  I said -- I can't
		believe those bastards -- I said we were
		great, I said people can come and sit and
		read for hours and no one bothers them, I
		said we stock 150,000 titles, I showed
		them the New York City section.  I said
		we were a goddamn piazza where people
		could mingle and mix and be.

			     KEVIN
		A piazza?

			     JOE
		I was eloquent.  Shit.  It's just
		inevitable, isn't it?  People are going
		to want to turn her into Joan of Arc --

			     KEVIN
		-- and you into Attila the Hun.

			     JOE
		Well it's not me personally, it's more
		like it's the company --

			     KATHLEEN
			(on the television)
		And I have to say, I have met Joe Fox,
		who owns Foxbooks, and I have heard him
		compared his store to a Price Club and the
		books in it to cans of olive oil.

	On Joe, reacting.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	A small rally is taking place, with picket signs.  Kathleen
	is standing on a small speaker's platform, along with the
	Borough President.

			     KATHLEEN
		My mother used to say to me that every
		book you sell is a gift from the
		heart...

	EXT. FOXBOOKS - DAY

	As 20 CHILDREN march in front of the store, holding little
	makeshift picket signs and singing songs.  "One, two, three,
	four, we don't want this Superstore."

	Customers go right through the line and into the store.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	We can hear the pickets marching and singing outside --
	although the store is full of customers anyway.  The Fox men
	-- Joe, Nelson and Schuyler -- are sitting in the cafe.
	Nelson is holding a copy of a weekly newspaper, which has the
	old high-school yearbook picture of William Spungeon on the
	front page and a headline: William Spungeon Emerges from
	Hiding to Support Bookstore.

			     SCHUYLER
		Who is this Spungeon anyway?

			     JOE
		He's a writer.

			     NELSON
		Well, I've never heard of him.  And
		neither has anyone else in this place.

	INT. TV SET - NIGHT

	As we see SIDNEY-ANN STRONGIN, a young and attractive PBS
	talk show hostess for a show called Inside Media.

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		The New York Literary world was shocked
		this week when William Spungeon, the most
		famously reclusive author since J.D.
		Salinger, announced that he was coming
		out of hiding because of his loyalty to a
		small children's bookstore on the West
		Side of Manhattan.  Discussing this
		tonight is a man I happen to think of as
		one of this city's most underappreciated
		assets, Frank Navasky.

			     FRANK
		Thank you.

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		This all happened because of you, didn't
		it --

			     FRANK
		Well, I knew William Spungeon loved
		children's books so I wrote a provocative
		column --

			     SIDNEY-ANN
		Your specialty.

	Frank laughs.  Sidney-Ann laughs.

			     FRANK
		And it kind of smoked him out.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As she and Frank watch the television show.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Technologically speaking, the world's 
		out of hand.  Take the VCR.  The whole
		idea of a VCR is that it makes it possible
		for you to tape what's on television
		while you're out of the house.  But the
		whole point of being out of the house is
		so you can miss what's on television.
		Radio.  Now there's a medium I can get
		behind.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Well, we're on television... and you're
		good at it.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Thank you.

	Another little moment between them.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		The bookstore.  Tell us about it.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Are you planning to collect radios?

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Do you think I should?

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		The Shop Around the Corner is a true New
		York treasure.

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		As are you.  I'd love to have you back.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Any time.  Are we done?

			     SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
		Not at all.

			     FRANK ON TELEVISION
		Because I just want to say that the only
		show I do watch is yours.

			     KATHLEEN
			(appalled)
		Omigod.

			     FRANK
		Hey, I was just being polite.  Okay, I
		admit, I slobbered all over her.

	The show continues.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	As we see Kathleen flip the open sign to closed.

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	George is talking to Kathleen and Birdie, who is toting up
	the week's receipts.

			     GEORGE
		And I can't decide whether to put
		sausages into the meat sauce or just
		chopped meat.  Last time I made it,
		Detective Carter and I never even sat
		down to dinner because --
			(he makes some sort of hand
			 gesture indicating that sex
			 prevented them from dining)
		and last night, I made margaritas in the
		blender, and I took the ice cube and --

			     BIRDIE
		Spare us.

	George goes out the door.

	Birdie looks at Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't tell me.  Not the slightest
		difference?

	Birdie can't bring herself to answer.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		How could that be?  All this publicity
		and not one bit of difference?
		Oh Birdie, what am I going to do?  What
		would Mom have done?

			     BIRDIE
		Let's ask her.

	She opens the locket hanging around her neck.  There's a
	picture of Kathleen's mother inside it.  Birdie holds the
	locket up to her face.

			     BIRDIE
		Cecilia, what should we do?

	Birdie holds the locket to her ear and listens.  A pause.

			     KATHLEEN
		Birdie?

			     BIRDIE
		Shhhh.
			(after a beat, shrugs)
		She has no idea, but she thinks the
		window display is lovely.  Good night
		dearie.

	Birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag, goes out the
	door.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT

	It's starting to rain.  Kathleen lowers the grate over the
	store.  As she turns to walk away, William Spungeon steps in
	her path out of the shadows.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh my goodness, hello.  What are you
		doing here.

			     SPUNGEON
		Loitering.  Lurking.  Skulking.
		Stalking.

	He laughs.  So does she.  Dramatically, he whips out an
	umbrella and opens it over the two of them.

			     SPUNGEON (cont'd)
		You look very beautiful.

			     KATHLEEN
		Thank you.  But I'm a wreck.

	He touches her cheek suddenly.  Kathleen starts.  Then he
	blows on his hand.

			     SPUNGEON
		An eyelash.  It's gone.

	Kathleen relaxes.  They start walking.

			     KATHLEEN
		Are you writing another book?

			     SPUNGEON
		I'm in the home stretch.  I'll be done in
		approximately six more years.

			     KATHLEEN
		Should I discount?

			     SPUNGEON
		It's about a man on a quest for knowledge
		who meets a woman he cannot resist.

			     KATHLEEN
		If I discount I have to fire someone
		because I can't discount with this
		overhead but whom could I fire?  I
		couldn't fire anyone.

	Spungeon suddenly puts his hand through Kathleen's hair.  She
	stops, frozen in place.

			     SPUNGEON
		You have your mother's hair.  Thick,
		wild, the color of Nebraska wheat.

	He grabs her and tries to kiss her.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you doing?  Let me go.

	He backs her into a wall.

			     KATHLEEN
		Stop it.  Are you crazy?

	She kicks him in the shins, wiggles free and runs away.

			     SPUNGEON
			(calling after her)
		If you change your mind, you can E-mail
		me.  Hermit@AOL.com.

	INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT

	The mail form says "To:" and Kathleen types in "NY 152".

	The form says "Re:" and Kathleen types in:  "Advice"

	Rain is falling.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I need help.  Do you still want to meet
		me?

	EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Rain is falling.

	We hear the sound of the computer.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		"Where?  When?"

	INT. NUT SHOP OF BROADWAY - DAY

	George, Kathleen and Christina in the shop.  Kathleen is
	buying more lollipops.

			     KATHLEEN
		We're meeting in a public place.

			     CHRISTINA
		Well don't go anywhere with him.  Don't
		even go out to the street with him
		afterwards.  Get a dial cab to just sit
		there and wait for you.

			     GEORGE
		Did you tell Frank?

			     KATHLEEN
		There's nothing to tell.

			     CHRISTINA
		But did you tell him?

			     KATHLEEN
		He's away.  At the 32nd anniversary of
		the Chicago Seven trial.

			     GEORGE
		And he's gone to a place where there are
		no phones.  Do you even know this guy's
		name?

	Kathleen shakes her head no.

			     CHRISTINA
		And you're going to meet him in a bar?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not a bar.  That place on 83rd with the
		cheesecake.

			     GEORGE
		And he will wear a flower in his lapel,
		and you will be carrying a copy of Anna
		Karenina with a rose in it.

	No answer.

			     CHRISTINA
		Oh God, no.

			     KATHLEEN
		Not Anna Karenina.  Pride and Prejudice.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS - NIGHT

	As Joe and Kevin walk out of the store and start downtown.

			     KEVIN
		I suppose she's carrying a copy of a book
		with a flower in it.

	Joe doesn't say anything.

			     KEVIN
		Not really.

			     JOE
		Really.

			     KEVIN
		Which Jane Austen is it?

			     JOE
		Pride and Prejudice.

			     KEVIN
		She could be a real dog.

			     JOE
		I know.  Look, I'll just stay ten
		minutes.  I'll say hello.  Drink a cup of
		coffee and split.  I'm outta here.

	He looks at Kevin.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		Walk me there, okay?

	EXT. 83RD STREET - NIGHT

	As the two men walk toward Cafe Lalo, the European cafe on
	West 83rd Street.

			     JOE
		What if she has a really high, squeaky
		voice?  I hate that.  It reminds me of
		those mice in Cinderella.

			     KEVIN
		What mice in Cinderella?

			     JOE
		Gus-gus and oh shit, I can't remember the
		other one.  Why am I compelled to meet
		her?  I'm just ruining a good thing.

			     KEVIN
		You're taking it to the next level.  I
		always do that.  I always take a
		relationship to the next level, and if it
		works okay I take it to the next level
		after that, until I can finally get to
		the level where it becomes absolutely
		necessary for me to leave.

			     JOE
		I'm not going to stay long anyway.  I
		already said that, didn't I.  Christ.
		I'm a total wreck.

	As they reach:

	EXT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

	Joe stops and looks at Kevin.

			     JOE
		Kevin, this woman is the most adorable
		creature I have ever come in contact
		with.  If she turns out to be even as
		good-looking as a mailbox, I will be
		crazy not to turn my life upside down
		and marry her.

			     KEVIN
		She could be a real dog.

			     JOE
			(a total panic)
		You go look.

			     KEVIN
		Me?

			     JOE
		Just go to the window and check her out.

			     KEVIN
		You're pathetic.

	Kevin goes to the window and looks inside.

	EXT. CAFE LALO - NIGHT

	Joe and Kevin in front.

	Kevin looks in the window.

			     JOE
		See her?

			     KEVIN
		There's a beautiful, whoa, a very
		beautiful girl.

			     JOE
		Yes.

			     KEVIN
		But no book.  Let me see, let me see...
		Wait a minute.  There's a book with a
		flower, so it must be her.

			     JOE
		What does he look like?

			     KEVIN
		There's a waiter blocking, I can't see
		her face.  He's serving her a cup of tea
		and she's putting in three spoonfuls of
		sugar --

			     JOE
		Well, why shouldn't she?

			     KEVIN
		No reason.  Unless she has hypoglycemia.
		Oh, he's moving.

			     JOE
		Can you see her?

			     KEVIN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		And? --

			     KEVIN
			(clearly frustrated)
		She's very pretty.

			     JOE
		She is.  I knew she would be.  She had
		to be.

			     KEVIN
		She looks... I would say she has a little
		of the coloring of that Kathleen Kelly
		person.

			     JOE
		Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore.

			     KEVIN
		Why not?  You said you thought she was
		attractive.

			     JOE
		So what?  Who cares about Kathleen Kelly?

			     KEVIN
		Well, if you don't like Kathleen Kelly,
		I can tell you right now you ain't gonna
		like this girl.

			     JOE
		Why not?

			     KEVIN
		Because it is Kathleen Kelly.

	Joe elbows Kevin aside and looks.

			     JOE
		Oh, God.

	A long beat.

			     KEVIN
		What are you going to do?

			     JOE
		Nothing.

			     KEVIN
		You're going to let her just wait there?

			     JOE
		Yes.  Yes I am.  That's exactly what I'm
		going to do.  Why not?

			     KEVIN
		But she wrote the letters.

			     JOE
		Good night, Kevin.  I'll see you
		tomorrow.

	He walks away, leaving Kevin.

	Kevin stares after him.  Then he walks away in the other
	direction.

	INT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her
	tea.  She's starting to feel a little foolish.  She checks
	her watch.

	A loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next
	to hers.  They're laughing.  A man from the group grabs the
	empty chair at Kathleen's table.

			     MAN
		Do you mind?

	Kathleen jumps up.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, yes.  I'm expecting someone.
		Please.

	She takes the chair back.  Sits down again.  She watches the
	group as they playfully fight over the menus.

	She checks her watch again.  Then she opens her copy of Pride
	and Prejudice and looks at it.  She can't focus.

	A man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at
	him.  But he's going to meet another group of people.

	As he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower
	onto the floor.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh!

	She jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were
	precious china.

	In the window, now, behind her, Joe appears.  He watches, as
	she rearranges the book and the flower.

	He disappears from sight.

	A beat...

	He walks in the door.

			     JOE
		Kathleen Kelly.  Hello.  What a
		coincidence.  Mind if I sit down?

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes I do.  I'm expecting someone.

	Joe picks up her book, looks at it.

			     JOE
		Pride and Prejudice.

	Kathleen grabs it back.

			     KATHLEEN
		Do you mind?

	She places it back on the table, puts the rose into it.

			     JOE
		I didn't know you were a Jane Austen
		fan.  Not that it's a surprise.  I bet
		you read it every year.  I bet you just
		love Mr. Darcy, and that your sentimental
		heart beats wildly at the thought that he
		and whatever her name is are really,
		honestly and truly going to end up
		together.

			     KATHLEEN
		Would you please leave?

	Joe sits down.

			     KATHLEEN
		Please?

			     JOE
		I'll get up as soon as your friend comes.
		Is he late?

			     KATHLEEN
		The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is
		Elizabeth Bennet and she's one of the
		greatest, most complex characters ever
		written, not that you would know.

			     JOE
		As a matter of fact I've read it.

			     KATHLEEN
		Well, good for you.

			     JOE
		I think you'd discover a lot of things if
		you really knew me.

			     KATHLEEN
		If I really knew you, I know what I would
		find -- instead of a brain, a cash
		register, instead of a heart, a bottom
		line.

	Kathleen is shocked at herself.

			     JOE
		What is it?

			     KATHLEEN
		I just had a breakthrough, and I have to
		thank you for it.  For the first time in
		my life, when confronted with a horrible,
		insensitive person I actually knew what I
		wanted to say and I said it.

			     JOE
		I think you have a gift for it.  It was a
		splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.


			     KATHLEEN
		Meanness?  Let me tell you --

			     JOE
		Don't misunderstand me, I'm just paying
		you a compliment.

	He lifts the book off the table.  Kathleen grabs for it.

			     KATHLEEN
		Why are you doing this?

	She manages to get the book, leaving Joe with the rose.

			     JOE
		What have we have?  A red, no, crimson
		rose, tucked into the pages.  Something
		you read about in a book, no doubt.  One
		of those books with a lady in a nightgown
		on the cover about to throw herself off a
		cliff.

	She holds her hand out for it.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Give it to me.

	Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.

			     JOE
		It's a joke to you, isn't it?
		Everything's a joke to you.

	She grabs the rose.  Puts it back in the book.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Please leave.  I beg you.

	He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very
	next table, with his back to her.

	The door to the restaurant opens.  Kathleen looks at it
	hopefully.  A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined
	by a pleasant looking woman.

	For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the
	wind has just gone out of her sails.  She takes out her
	compact, looks into her mirror.  She slides it over to look
	behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her.  He
	turns away suddenly.

	Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.

			     JOE
		You know what the handkerchief reminds
		me of?  The first day I met you --

			     KATHLEEN
		The first day you lied to me --

			     JOE
		I didn't lie to you --

			     KATHLEEN
		You did too --

			     JOE
		I did not --

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought all that Fox stuff was so
		charming.  F-O-X.

			     JOE
		I never lied about it --

			     KATHLEEN
		"Joe.  Just call me Joe."  As if you were
		one of those stupid 22-year-old girls
		with no last name.  "Hi, I'm Kimberley."
		"Hi, I'm Janice."  What's wrong with
		them?  Don't they know you're supposed to
		have last names?  It's like they're a
		whole generation of cocktail waitresses.

	She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off
	on.  But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her
	table.

			     JOE
		I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --

			     KATHLEEN
		That's not what I meant --

			     JOE
		And when I said the thing about the Price
		Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't
		what I meant either --

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire.  I
		feel so sorry for you.

	The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTITE
	in a boa comes in the door.

			     JOE
		I am going to take a wild guess that this
		isn't him, either.  Who is he, I wonder.
		Not, I gather, the world's greatest
		living expert on Julius and Ethel
		Rosenberg, but someone else entirely.
		Will you be you be mean to him too?  Will
		you start out sweet as sugar candy and
		then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt
		from the blue, find that sharp little 
		tongue of yours?

			     KATHLEEN
		No, I won't.  Because the man who's
		coming here tonight is completely unlike
		you.  The man who is coming here is kind
		and funny -- he has the most wonderful
		sense of humor --

			     JOE
		But he's not here.

			     KATHLEEN
		If he's not here, he has a reason,
		because there is not a cruel or careless
		bone in his body.  I can't expect you to
		know anything about a person like that.
		You've nothing but a suit.

	A beat.  Joe gets up.

			     JOE
		That is my cue.  Good night.

	Joe leaves.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER THAT NIGHT

	Kathleen comes down the street.  She drops the rose in the
	trash can.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - A MINUTE LATER

	Kathleen comes in, drops the book on the table, takes off her
	coat and goes immediately to the computer.  She clicks on
	American Online.  Waits impatiently to connect.  Looks with
	anticipation at the mail box.

	THE COMPUTER SCREEN - NO MAIL

	Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face.

	She takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her
	face and blows her nose.  Then looks at her handkerchief and
	tosses it over her shoulder.

	She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of
	her shoes.

	Then she lies down on the bed, fully clothed.  She reaches
	up to turn out the light.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As Joe turns on his closet light and hangs up his jacket.
	The computer is on the desk, and the light on it illuminates
	the room.

	Patricia is in the next room, eating matzos.

			     PATRICIA (O.C.)
		So I said to her, "If you think I will
		even talk to you about paying that kind
		of advance for an author whose last book
		is being used as trivets all over the
		world, you are completely crazy."

	On Joe's face, barely bearing.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

	As Kevin and Joe walk through the store.

			     KEVIN
		But underneath that disagreeable exterior
		she could turn out to be --

			     JOE
		A real bitch.  Let's not talk about it.
		I'm going back to the office.  You must
		have work to do.

			     KEVIN
		Not really.  This place is humming like a
		top.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As Kathleen comes around the corner.  Christina is waiting.

			     CHRISTINA
		What happened?

			     KATHLEEN
		He never came.

			     CHRISTINA
		He stood you up?

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

	As Kathleen puts her purse into the drawer.

			     KATHLEEN
		I think something happened, something
		terrible and unexpected that made it
		impossible for him --

	George walks in.

			     GEORGE
		What happened?

			     KATHLEEN
		He wasn't able to make it.

			     GEORGE
		He stood you up.

			     KATHLEEN
		What could have happened?
			(continued)

	George looks suddenly stricken.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		Why didn't he come?  Maybe he showed up,
		took one look at me and left.

			     CHRISTINA
		Not possible.

			     KATHLEEN
		Maybe there was a subway accident.

			     CHRISTINA
		Absolutely.

			     KATHLEEN
		A train was trapped underground with him
		inside.

			     CHRISTINA
		And no phone.

	George continues to look stricken.  He's starting to shake
	his head.

			     KATHLEEN
		Or an automobile accident.  Those cab
		drivers are maniacs.

			     CHRISTINA
		They hit something and you slam right
		into that plastic partition.

			     KATHLEEN
		His elbows could be in splints -- so he
		can't really dial --

			     CHRISTINA
		Or he could be in the hospital in one of
		those semi-private room with like --
			     
			     CHRISTINA & KATHLEEN
			(together)
		-- no phone.

	They look at George.  Still shaking his head.

			     KATHLEEN
			(to George)
		What?

	George hands them a New York Post.  They look at the cover:
	COPS NAB ROOFTOP KILLER

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you saying?

			     GEORGE
		It could be.

	Dead silence.

			     GEORGE (cont'd)
		He was arrested two blocks from the
		cheesecake place.

			     CHRISTINA
		Is there a picture?

	There it is.  It's of a man with his jacket pulled over his
	head.

	They all look at it.

			     CHRISTINA
		So that explains it.

			     GEORGE
		He was in jail.

			     CHRISTINA
		And there was a phone --

			     GEORGE
		-- but he got only one call and he had to
		use it to call his lawyer.

			     CHRISTINA
		You are so lucky.

			     GEORGE
		You could be dead.

			     KATHLEEN
		Are you crazy?  This man couldn't
		possibly be the rooftop killer.

			     CHRISTINA
		Remember when you thought Frank might be
		the Unabomber?

			     KATHLEEN
		That was different.

			     CHRISTINA
		How long did you sit there all alone?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not that long.  Joe Fox came in --

			     CHRISTINA
		Joe Fox!

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't want to talk about it.
			(closes her eyes)
		Let's get to work.

	They look around.  There's no one in the store and nothing to
	do.

	A pause.

			     KATHLEEN
		There must be something to do.  There's
		always something to do.

	They hear the jingle of the front door.  They look hopefully
	toward it.  It's only Birdie.

			     CHRISTINA
		He stood her up.

	Hold on Kathleen as the computer sound begins.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I have been thinking about you.  Last
		night I went to meet you and you weren't
		there.  I wish I knew why.  I felt so
		foolish.
			(continued)

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she types.  And we cut from her face to the screen as we
	hear a voice-over:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		And as I waited, someone else showed up,
		a man who has made my professional life a
		misery, and an amazing thing happened --
		I was able, for the first time in my
		life, to say the exact thing I wanted to say
		it.  And of course, afterwards, I felt
		terrible.  Just as you said I would.

	INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER

	The E-mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I was cruel, and I'm never cruel.  And
		even though I can hardly believe what I
		said mattered to this man -- to him, I'm
		just a bug to be crushed -- but what if
		it did?  No matter what he's done to me,
		there's no excuse for my behavior.
		Anyway, you are my dear friend, and I so
		wanted to talk to you.  I hope you have a
		good reason for not being there last
		night, but if you don't, and if we never
		really connect again, I just want to tell
		you how much it has meant to me to know
		you were there.

	Joe sits there a second.  A moment of intense ambivalence.
	Then he hits the Menu key and signs off.

			     COMPUTER
		Goodbye.

	Joe stands and leaves the room.

	The computer sits there.

	Hold on the computer.  We hear him open the refrigerator 
	door. We hear him close the refrigerator door.  He passes
	the den without even looking into it.  A moment later he
	comes back into the room, stares at the computer.  He starts
	for the bedroom, changes his mind.  Circles the computer.
	He's going to go cold turkey if it kills him.

	Fuck it.  He sits down.  Sign on.  Starts to type.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I am in Vancouver.

	He stops... Hits the delete button and erases the message.
	He starts typing again:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I was stuck in a meeting, which I
		couldn't get out of it, and there was
		no phone.

	He backspaces to erase "there was no phone."

	Screen now reads: I was stuck in a meeting, which I couldn't
	get out of it.  Joe sits there thinking for a moment.  Then he
	starts typing.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		The electricity went out in the building
		and we were trapped on the 18th floor and
		the telephone system blew too.

	He stops and looks at it.  Then he types:

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Amazingly enough.

	He sits looking at it.

	Then he deletes the whole thing.

	Sits looking at the blank screen.

			     JOE
		Fuck you.

	He clicks the Yes box.

	Then he starts to type again.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Dear friend: I cannot tell you what
		happened to me last night, but I beg you
		from the bottom of my heart to forgive me
		for not being there.

	He deletes "for not being there."

	Then types again, after "to forgive me".

			     JOE (V.O.)
		-- for what happened.  I feel terrible
		that you found yourself in a situation
		that caused you additional pain.  But I'm
		absolutely sure that whatever you said
		last night was provoked, even deserved.
		And everyone says things they regret when
		they're worried or stressed.  You were
		expecting to see someone you trusted and
		met the enemy instead.  The fault is
		mine.
			(continued)

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As Kathleen and Christina walk down the street together.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		Someday I'll explain everything.
		Meanwhile, I'm still here.  Talk to me.

			     CHRISTINA
		Did he say anything about meeting again?

			     KATHLEEN
		Not really.  It doesn't matter.  We'll
		just be like George Bernard Shaw and Mrs.
		Patrick Campbell and write letters our
		whole lives --

	They go into an apartment building.

	INT. BIRDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	A large rent-controlled West Side apartment.  Birdie is 
	pouring tea.  There's a plate of cookies.

	Christina is looking at the picture of Birdie as a young
	woman, dressed in a sort of Carmen Miranda getup.

			     CHRISTINA
		Where was this taken, Birdie?

			     BIRDIE
		Seville.

			     KATHLEEN
		When you had the thunderbolt?

			     BIRDIE
		Yes.  What did you decide, dearie?

			     KATHLEEN
		Close.  We're going to close.

			     CHRISTINA
		Close.

			     KATHLEEN
		Although it feels like such a failure.
		It feels like I'm quitting.  It feels
		like... Mom...

	She closes her eyes.

	Birdie sits down on the loveseat next to Kathleen, puts her
	arms around her.  Hold on them.

			     BIRDIE
		Keeping the store open doesn't keep your
		mother alive, although sometimes I think
		we all think it does.

	Christina looks over at the picture of Birdie.

			     CHRISTINA
		Who was it, Birdie?  That you had the
		thunderbolt over?

	Birdie shakes her head.  She's not going to tell them.

			     CHRISTINA (cont'd)
		It's so romantic.

			     BIRDIE
		But it wasn't meant to be.

			     CHRISTINA
		Why not?

			     BIRDIE
		He ran Spain.

			     CHRISTINA
		Spain?

			     BIRDIE
		The country.  He ran it.  That was his
		job.  And then he died.  Just as well.

	INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE - NIGHT

	As Frank and Kathleen go up the escalator, on their way to a 
	movie.

			     FRANK
		She fell in love with Generalissimo
		Franco?

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't say that.  We don't know that for
		sure.

			     FRANK
		Who else could it have been?  It was
		probably around 1960 --

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, it's not like he was something
		normal, like a socialist or an anarchist
		or something --

			     FRANK
		It happened in Spain.  People do really
		stupid things in foreign countries.

			     KATHLEEN
		Absolutely.  They buy leather jackets,
		they go see Flamenco, they ride in
		gondolas, they eat in restaurants where
		guitarists sing Malaguena sola Rosa, but
		they don't fall in love with fascist
		dictators.

	They enters one of the theatres.

	INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS

	As they find seats and sit down.  A trailer is playing.

			     KATHLEEN
		Birdie is a very kind person, she's
		practically my surrogate mother.

			     FRANK
		Well she's out of her mind.

			     KATHLEEN
		She is not.

			     FRANK
		I could never ever be with anyone who
		doesn't take politics as seriously as I
		do.

	The person in front of them turns around.

			     PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM
		Do you mind?

			     FRANK
		A hot dog is singing.  You need quiet
		while a hot dog is singing?

	The two of them sit there.

			     KATHLEEN
		I have something to tell you.  I didn't
		vote.

			     FRANK
		What?

			     KATHLEEN
		In the last mayoral election, when Rudy
		Giuliani was running against Ruth
		Messinger, I went to get a manicure and
		forgot to vote.

			     FRANK
		Since when do you get manicures?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, I suppose you could never be with a
		woman who gets manicures.

			     FRANK
		Forget it.  It's okay.  I forgive you.

			     PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM
		Shhhhhh.

			     KATHLEEN
		You forgive me.

	Hold on them a beat.

	Kathleen stands and walks out of the theatre.

	INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE ESCALATOR - NIGHT

	Kathleen on the down escalator.  Frank scrambling to catch up
	with her.

			     FRANK
		What's going on?

	Kathleen's upset.

			     FRANK (cont'd)
		Hey.  What is it?

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	As they walk uptown.

			     FRANK
		Look, this has been a big week, you're
		closing the store --

			     KATHLEEN
		It's not that, Frank, really it's not.
		It's just... Frank...

			     FRANK
		I know, that was terrible of me.

			     KATHLEEN
		What was?

			     FRANK
		To jump all over you when I'm the one
		who's really...  Oh, God, I don't know
		how to say this --

			     KATHLEEN
		What is it?

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

	As we see Kathleen and Frank being served drinks in a glassed-
	in extension of a restaurant.

	INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As Kathleen looks at Frank, waiting for him to begin.

			     FRANK
		You're a wonderful person, Kathleen.

			     KATHLEEN
		So are you.

			     FRANK
		And I'm honored that you want to be with
		me because you would never be with anyone
		who wasn't truly worthy --

			     KATHLEEN
		I feel exactly the same way about you.

			     FRANK
		Oh, God, don't say that, please, that
		just makes it worse.

			     KATHLEEN
		What?
			(he shakes his head)
		You don't love me?

	Frank shakes his head no.

			     KATHLEEN
		Me either.

			     FRANK
		You don't love me?

	Kathleen shakes her head no.

			     FRANK
		But we're so right for each other.

			     KATHLEEN
		I know.

	A long beat.

			     KATHLEEN
		That woman on television, right?
		Sidney-Ann.

	Frank nods.

			     FRANK
		I mean, nothing's happened or anything.

			     KATHLEEN
		I think she's a Republican.

			     FRANK
		I can't help myself.

	Kathleen pats him.

			     FRANK (cont'd)
		What about you?  Is there someone else?

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, somewhere out there, I'm sure.
		Somewhere --
			(she throws up her hands)
		In cyberspace.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

	As Frank, carrying a typewriter, walks out off Kathleen's
	building and puts it into the back of a taxicab.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

	As a sign goes up in the window: "Closing This Week: All
	Stock 40% off."

	INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - LATE THAT DAY

	The store is crowded.  People are buying stacks of books.
	We hear brief snatches of conversation: Birdie telling a
	customer she's planning to travel, Christina saying she's
	finally going to have to finish her dissertation, George
	saying he's been offered a job at Foxbooks but even though
	it's okay with Kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were
	the last place on the earth.

	There is a frantic, rummage sale atmosphere.

	Kathleen, busy at the cash register, looks up for a minute at
	her beautiful store being ravaged by vultures.  We hear the
	sound of the computer and hear her voice-over:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		My store is closing this week.
		I own a store.  Did I ever tell you that?
		Probably not.  It's a lovely store --

	As a woman dumps a huge stack of books on the checkout table.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		This is a tragedy.
			(yelling across the shop to her
			 husband)
		Honey, grab a copy of The Trumpet of the
		Swan.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		-- and in a week, it will be something
		really depressing, like a Baby Gap.  I
		am being amazingly brave --

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		What are you going to do with yourself?

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't know.  I'm going to take some
		time.  I have a little money saved.  I'm
		almost looking forward to it --

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		I am so cheerful I would make Pollyanna
		throw up.

			     SECOND SHOPPER
		I came here every Saturday when I was a
		little girl.  I remember when your mother
		gave me Anne of Green Gables.  "Read it
		with a box of Kleenex," that's what she
		told me.

			     THIRD SHOPPER
		She's looking down on you right now.

			     KATHLEEN
		I'm sure she is.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		I have promised myself I'm not going
		to cry.

	A FORTH SHOPPER approaches the counter with a stack of books
	up to his chin, and manages to slide the stack on the 
	counter.

			     FOURTH SHOPPER
		We should bomb Foxbooks.

			     KATHLEEN
		It's not their fault.  The truth is, the
		world is just... different.

	She starts ringing up the sale.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

	As Kathleen walks home.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
		Soon we'll just be a memory.  In fact,
		someone, some foolish person will
		probably think it's a tribute to this
		city, the way it keeps changing on you,
		the way you can never count on it, or
		something.  I know, because that's the
		sort of thing I'm always saying.  But the
		truth is, I'm heartbroken.  I feel as if
		part of me has died,  and my mother has
		died all over again, and no one can ever
		make it right.

	She stops in front of the window, watching the customers
	lined up to buy books.

	EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

	As Kathleen enters and looks around.

	She goes up the stairs.

	INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT

	As Kathleen walks into it.

	It's huge, of course.  With its reading area, and stage, and
	room for displays, and child-size furniture, and so many
	books and so many customers.

	Kathleen sits down on a little child-size chair, completely
	wilted.

	KATHLEEN FROM ANOTHER P.O.V.

	And now we see Joe watching her, from a distance.  She doesn't
	see him.

	A woman browsing, stops a sales person.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		Do you have the "Shoe" books?

			     SALESPERSON
		The "Shoe" books?  Who's the author?

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		I don't know.  My friend told me my
		daughter has to read the "Shoe" books, 
		so here I am.

			     KATHLEEN
		Noel Streatfeild.  Noel Streatfeild wrote
		Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes and
		Theater Shoes and Movie Shoes...
			(she starts crying as she tells
			 her)
		I'd start with Skating Shoes, it's my
		favorite, although Ballet Shoes is
		completely wonderful.

			     SALESPERSON
		Streatfeild.  How do you spell that?

			     KATHLEEN
		S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-I-L-D.

			     WOMAN SHOPPER
		Thank you.

	As she walks away.

			     KATHLEEN
			(to herself)
		They know nothing, they know absolutely
		nothing.

	ON JOE

	as he watches her.  We hear the sound of the computer.

	She starts out of the store.  And hold on him.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm sorry.

	INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN

	A screen which says Reply and which now reads "I'm sorry."

	INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY

	On Joe at his computer, staring at the screen.

			     JOE
		Asshole.

	He backspaces, deleting.  Starts typing again.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I'm sorry.  I don't know what to say.
		Truly I don't.  And anything I do say
		will sound trite.  I hope you feel
		better.

	He sits there, appalled at his own triteness.

	EXT. JOE'S STREET - NIGHT

	As a taxi comes down the street and stops in front of Joe's
	building.

			     PATRICIA (V.O.)
		What I was thinking was she'd probably
		make a great children's book either.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Why would you think that?

	They get out of the cab.

			     PATRICIA
		She knows everything.  She has flawless
		taste.  She's famous for it.
		The salesmen swear by her.  If she likes
		it, it sells.  Period.

	INT. JOE'S LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

	As they enter the lobby and walk toward the elevator.

			     JOE
		So you're going to offer her a job?

			     PATRICIA
		Why not?  What else has she got to do?

			     JOE
		Now that she's destitute --

			     PATRICIA
		Thanks to you.

			     JOE
		Well, I can't imagine her working for
		you.

			     PATRICIA
		Why not?

			     JOE
		She has a horrible personality, she's...
		nice to everyone all the time.  It's
		exhausting.  And her staff turnover is
		... non-existent.  They've been there
		forever.  Until... recently, when they
		all found out they were going to lose
		their jobs.

			     PATRICIA
		Thanks to you.

	The elevator door is closing.

			     PATRICIA (cont'd)
		Hold the elevator!

	They get in.

	INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

			     JOE
		Hello, Charlie, Veronica.

			     PATRICIA
		Last time, we rode in an elevator, we
		made the deal of the century.  What is
		going to happen this time?

			     CHARLIE
		Miss Grant's going to get me a part in
		one of her movies, that's what's going
		to happen.

			     VERONICA
		In your dream, Charlie.

			     PATRICIA
			(back to the conversation with
			 Joe)
		I love how you've totally forgotten you
		had any role in her current situation.
		It's so obtuse.  It reminds me of someone
		... Who?  Who does it remind me of?
			(thinks for a moment)
		Me!

	The elevator suddenly stops.

			     PATRICIA
		Shit.

			     VERONICA
		Shit.

			     JOE
		It is stuck?

			     CHARLIE
		Could be.

	He pushes the open button.  Nothing.  Turns the key, hits the
	open button, flicks the emergency switch.  The he starts
	hitting the buttons in every possible combination.

			     JOE
		Charlie, what are you doing?

			     CHARLIE
		Bang the door.

			     PATRICIA
		Really.

	Joe bangs the door.  Nothing.

			     CHARLIE
		I hope this thing doesn't plummet to the
		basement.

			     VERONICA
		Can it do that?

			     JOE
		No.

	He picks up the phone.

			     JOE
		This is Joe Fox.  Who is this?  Hi, Juan.
		We're stuck on the sixth floor.  There
		are four of us --

			     PATRICIA
			(grabs the phone)
		-- and if you don't get your ass up here
		in two shakes and get us out --

	He hangs up.

			     JOE
			(to Veronica)
		Are you all right?

			     VERONICA
		It's hot.

	Joe hands her his handkerchief.

			     CHARLIE
		Everyone should jump in the air.

			     PATRICIA
		What?

			     CHARLIE
		We jump.  The elevator thinks that no one
		is here and it opens.

	Everyone stares at each other.

			     JOE
		One -- two -- three --

	They all jump into the air.

	They all land.

	Nothing happens.

	INT. ELEVATOR - A LITTLE LATER

	Patricia is sitting on the elevator floor, polishing her
	nails.

	We hear the fire department banging outside...

			     VERONICA
		If I ever get out of here, I'm going to
		start speaking to my mother.  She slept
		with Oscar, and maybe it was Oscar's
		fault, I don't know, and then she sold
		the story to Inside Edition.
		That could have been Oscar's idea, too.
		Who knows?  But I divorced him.  I wonder
		what she's doing right this minute.  I
		think of her... whenever I hear about a
		new pill.  Ecstasy, Zoloft, Fenphen, I
		just think, I hope Mama knows about that.

	She takes out a tissue and dabs at her eyes.

			     PATRICIA
		Maybe you can make up on Rosie.  That
		would be so great for the book.

			     CHARLIE
			(trying to figure it out)
		If I ever get out of here...

			     PATRICIA
		If I ever get out of here, I'm having my
		eyes lasered.

			     CHARLIE
		I'm marrying Oreet.  I love her.  I
		should marry her.  I don't know what's
		been stopping me.

	He takes out his wallet and looks at a picture of Oreet,
	shows it to Joe.

			     JOE
		If I ever get out of here, I'm going to --

	He stops, he looks at Patricia who is fishing through her
	purse.

			     PATRICIA
		Where is my TicTacs?
			(looks at Joe)
		What?

	The firemen crowbar open the elevator door.

	EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - NIGHT

	Joe and Brinkley walk out on the dock toward Joe's boat.  Joe
	is carrying Brinkley's pillow, his laptop and a suitcase.

	He boards his boat and goes below.  A light goes on.  We hear
	the sound of the computer.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		I came home tonight and got into the
		elevator to go to my apartment.  An hour
		later, I got out of the elevator and
		Brinkley and I moved out.  Suddenly
		everything had become clear.
			(continued)

	INT. BOAT - NIGHT

	A small sleeping area with a berth and a little table, where
	Joe's laptop has been hooked up to the phone.

	Joe is on the narrow berth, as is Brinkley.

			     JOE (V.O., cont'd)
		It's a long story.  Full of the personal
		details we avoid so carefully...

	Joe puts Brinkley on the floor, on his pillow.  Brinkley
	jumps back onto the berth with Joe.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Kathleen is making tea.  She starts toward the bedroom.  We
	see her computer, now hooked up in the living room, where all
	of Frank's typewriters used to be.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I wonder whether change isn't a kind of
		infection.  You start with one thing --
		something you never ever thought would
		change and it does --

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		and the next thing you know even your bed
		is in a different place.

	Kathleen enters the bedroom and we see the entire room has
	been rearranged.

	She gets into bed and turns on the television set.

	EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

	The bookshelves are empty.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
		Six months ago, when you and I first met,
		I knew everything about myself -- what I
		would be doing for the rest of my life
		and even the person I would be doing it
		with.  Now I know nothing.

	On the door is a small sign.  "After 42 years, we are closing
	our doors.  We have loved being part of your lives."

	Kathleen turns out the light in the store and opens the door.

	The little bell over the door jingles.

	Kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches
	it.

	Then she comes out of the store, carrying the bell.

	Kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate
	for the last time.

	The grate starts to lower.

	Kathleen looks at her store, one last time.  Then she walks
	off, carrying the bell.  We hear it jingle in the night.

	And hold on The Shop Around the Corner, and it slowly turns
	into a computer-enhanced version of itself.

	And then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty
	screen.

			     ANNABEL
		I don't want to go to the Children's Zoo.

			     JOE
		Okay.  The Staten Island Ferry.

			     ANNABEL
		I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

			     MATT
		I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

			     JOE
		Well we can't go to the Storybook Lady.

	INT. JAPANESE NOODLE RESTAURANT - DAY

	Annabel is sitting in her chair, staring glumly at a bowl of
	Japanese soup and noodles.

			     JOE
		I'll read you a story.

			     ANNABEL
		Where did she go?

			     JOE
		She had to close her store.

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		She didn't have enough business.

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		Well.  Her store was very close to our
		store, and you know our store sells books
		at a slightly lower cost --

			     ANNABEL
		Why?

			     JOE
		Why do we sell at a lower cost?  So more
		people can buy books.

			     ANNABEL
		Why couldn't she sell that way too?

			     JOE
		Because she's small and we're big.  How
		about we go get some candy?

			     ANNABEL
		So now she's gone and it's all your
		fault.

			     JOE
		It's business, Annabel.  It's not
		personal.  How about we go get so much
		candy you'll be bouncing off the walls
		for days?

			     MATT
		What's personal?

			     ANNABEL
		Personal means that she's gone forever,
		and now we'll never get another book from
		her as long as we ever live.

	She burst into tears.  Matt bursts into tears too.

			     JOE
		Remember the man who worked with her?

			     ANNABEL
			(a wail)
		No.

			     JOE
		Well I hired him.

		You killed the Storybook Lady.

	Matt throws himself on the ground, crying.

	Annabel sobs hysterically.

	Nelson ignores the question.

		I've stayed here after, let's see, your

			     JOE
		-- the nanny --

			     NELSON
		Was she the nanny?  I forgot that.  How
		ironic.  Then there was the ice skater --

			     JOE
		-- also the nanny --

			     NELSON
		Really.  How amazingly ironic.  Sybil the
		astrologer.

			     JOE
		Whose moon turned out to be in somebody
		else's house, as I recall.

			     NELSON
		Just like Gillian.

			     JOE
		Gillian ran off with someone?

			     NELSON
		The nanny.

			     JOE
		Nanny Maureen?  Gillian ran off with
		Nanny Maureen?  That's incredibly
		ironic.

			     NELSON
		True true.

			     JOE
		There's no other word for it.

			     NELSON
		Who did you break up with?

			     JOE
		Patricia.  You met her.

			     NELSON
		Would I like her?
			(cracks himself up)
		Just kidding.  Isn't this great?  Have
		some peanuts.  Of course I have to live
		out of a suitcase for a least three
		weeks, and then there's the inevitable
		legal hassle, more of your inheritance
		down the drain.

			     JOE
		Don't worry about it.

			     NELSON
		I won't.  But then I get to meet someone
		new.  That's the easy part.

			     JOE
		Oh, right, a snap to find the one single
		person in the world who fills your heart
		with joy.

			     NELSON
		Don't be ridiculous.  Have I ever been
		with anyone who fits that description?
		Have you?

			     JOE
		On to the next.

			     NELSON
		Isn't it a beautiful night?

	Hold on Joe.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DAY

	Joe, on his way to Kathleen's apartment building, carrying a
	bunch of daisies, wrapped in cellophane.

	Joe goes up the stoop to her building and looks at buzzer.
	Sees Kelly, 3A.  He presses.  Nothing.  Presses again.

			     KATHLEEN
			(voice clogged, through
			 intercom)
		Who is it?

			     JOE
		Joe Fox.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

	Kathleen, in her pajamas, at the intercom, horrified.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you doing here?

			     JOE
		May I please come up?

			     KATHLEEN
		It's really not a good idea.

	Someone else walks up to the door, unlocks it and walks in.
	Joe follows.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

			     KATHLEEN
			(into the intercom)
		I have a terrible cold, can you hear it?
		I'm sniffling and not really awake --

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	As Kathleen continues to talk through the Intercom to an
	empty stoop.

			     KATHLEEN'S VOICE
		and I'm sleeping practically twenty-four
		hours a day, and taking echinacea --

	INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

			     KATHLEEN
			(into intercom)
		-- and vitamin C, so I would really
		appreciate it if you would come some
		other time --

	There's a knock on the door right next to her.  Kathleen
	practically jumps out of her skin.  She looks through the
	peephole.  There he is.

			     JOE
		Kathleen?

			     KATHLEEN
		Just a second.

	She puts on a robe, runs frantically about picking up various
	scattered wadded-up Kleenexs, opens the front door.  Joe is
	holding a bunch of flowers wrapped in paper.

			     JOE
		Hello.

			     KATHLEEN
		What are you doing here?

			     JOE
		I heard you were sick and I was worried
		and I wanted to --
			(he hears voices)
		Is someone here?

			     KATHLEEN
		Just the Home Shopping Network.

			     JOE
		Bought any porcelain dolls?

			     KATHLEEN
		I was thinking about it.
			(beat)
		You put me out of business --

			     JOE
		I know that --

			     KATHLEEN
		And now you turn up with flowers?  Did
		you come to gloat?

			     JOE
		No.

			     KATHLEEN
		To offer me a job --

			     JOE
		No, I wouldn't think of --

			     KATHLEEN
		Because I have plans, I have lots of
		offers.  I've been offered a job by --
		well, actually by --

			     JOE
		My former?

			     KATHLEEN
		Former?

			     JOE
		We broke up.

			     KATHLEEN
		That's too bad.  You seemed so perfect
		for each other.
			(she claps her hand over her
			 mouth)
		I don't mean to say things like that.  No
		matter what you have done to me, there is
		no excuse for my saying anything like
		that.  But every time I see you --

			     JOE
		Things like that just seem to fly out of
		your mouth.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm starting over.
			(sharply)
		Thank you for coming.  Goodbye.
			(she says it again, a little
			 more nicely)
		Thank you for coming. Goodbye.

	She starts to the door.

			     JOE
		I bought you flowers.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh.
			(trying as hard as she can)
		Thank you.

	She takes them.

	He takes them back.

			     JOE
		Why don't I put them in water?

	He heads for the kitchen.  A beat, while she stares after him.
	Then follows.

	INT. KITCHEN - DAY

	When Kathleen gets to the kitchen, Joe is checking the kettle
	for water.  Turns on the stove.

			     JOE
		You're sick.  Sit down, please.

	He pulls out a kitchen chair.  Kathleen sits.  She's a little
	woozy.

			     JOE
		Vase?

			     KATHLEEN
		Upper left.

	He gets out a vase.  Fills it with water.

			     JOE
		George says hello.  He told me you
		weren't feeling well.

			     KATHLEEN
		How is George?

			     JOE
		Great.  He's revolutionizing the place.
		No one is allowed to work in his
		department who doesn't have a Ph.D. in
		children's literature.

	He unwraps the paper around the flowers.  Daisies.  Puts them
	in a vase.

			     KATHLEEN
		I love daisies.

			     JOE
		You told me.

	He puts the vase on the kitchen table.  Kathleen plays with
	the petals.

			     KATHLEEN
		They're so friendly.  Don't you think
		they are the friendliest flower?

			     JOE
		I do.

			     KATHLEEN
		When did you break up?

			     JOE
		Oh, a couple of weeks ago.

			     KATHLEEN
		Everyone is breaking up.  You.  Me.  This
		other person I know broke up with someone
		in an elevator.  I think it was in an
		elevator.  Or just outside it.  Or after
		it.  It got stuck.  I think.  And suddenly
		everything became clear.  When I saw you,
		at the coffee place, I was waiting for him
		and I was --

			     JOE
		-- charming.

			     KATHLEEN
		I was not charming.

			     JOE
		Well, you looked charming.

	The teakettle whistles.  Joe turns off the burner.

			     JOE
		Tea?

			     KATHLEEN
		Upper right.

	He gets out mugs and teabags and pours the water.

			     KATHLEEN
		I was upset.  And I was horrible.

			     JOE
		Honey?

	Kathleen nods.  He puts in two spoonfuls, gives it to her.

			     JOE
		I was horrible.

			     KATHLEEN
		True.  But I have no excuse.

	She picks up the daisies and carries them into:

	INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Joe follows her.  They both sit.

			     JOE
		Whereas I am a horrible person and have
		no choice but to be horrible, is that
		what you're saying?

			     KATHLEEN
		No I am not saying that because I am done
		saying horrible things, even to you.

			     JOE
		You did it again.

	She claps her hand over her mouth.

			     JOE
		I put you out of business.  You're
		entitled to hate me.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't hate you --

			     JOE
		But you'll never forgive me.  Like
		Elizabeth.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who?

			     JOE
		Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice.
		She was too proud --

			     KATHLEEN
		I thought you hated Pride and Prejudice.

			     JOE
		-- or was she too prejudiced and Mr.
		Darcy too proud?  I can never remember.
			(beat)
		It wasn't personal --

			     KATHLEEN
		-- It was business.  What is that
		supposed to mean?  I am so sick of that.
		All it means is it's not personal to you,
		but it's personal to me, it's personal to
		a lot of people.
			(she shrugs helplessly)
		What's wrong with personal anyway?

			     JOE
		Nothing.

			     KATHLEEN
		I mean, whatever else anything is, it
		ought to begin by being personal.

	Kathleen stands up, picks up the daisies.

			     KATHLEEN
		My head's starting to get funny.  I have
		to go back to bed.

	They walk to...

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Kathleen puts the daisies next to the bed and gets into it.
	She fluffs up the pillows, pulls up the blankets, surrounds
	herself with Kleenex and Evian and sneezes a gigantic sneeze.

			     KATHLEEN
		Why did you stop by?  I forget.

			     JOE
		I wanted to be your friend.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh.

			     JOE
		I knew it wasn't possible.  What can I
		say?  Sometimes a person just wants the
		impossible.  Could I ask you something?

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     JOE
		What happened with that guy at the cafe?

			     KATHLEEN
		Nothing.

			     JOE
		But you're crazy about him --

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.  I am.

			     JOE
		Then why don't you run off with him?
		What are you waiting for?

	A long beat.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't actually know him.

			     JOE
		Really.

			     KATHLEEN
		We only know each other -- oh God, you're
		not going to believe this --

			     JOE
		Let me guess.  From the Internet.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		You've Got Mail.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

			     JOE
		Very powerful words.

			     KATHLEEN
		Yes.

	Joe sits on the edge of the bed.

			     JOE
		I'm happy for him.  Although -- could I
		make a little suggestion?  I think you
		should meet him.  No.  I take it back.
		Why meet him?

			     KATHLEEN
			(starting to get sharp again)
		I hardly think I need advice from someone
		who --

	He reaches out and gently claps his hand over her mouth.  And
	holds it there.  It's unexpectedly tender and sexy.

			     JOE
		I concede I bring out the worst in you,
		but let me help you not to say something
		you'll just torture yourself about for
		years to come.

	She starts to smile and he removes his hand.

	They look at each other.

			     JOE
		I hope you're better soon.  It would be 
		a shame to miss New York in the spring.

	Joe stands.

			     KATHLEEN
		Thank you for the daisies.

	He starts for the door.

			     JOE
		Take care.

			     KATHLEEN
		I will.

			     JOE
		Goodbye.

			     KATHLEEN
		Goodbye.

	We hear the door close.

	Hold on Kathleen.

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Christina is running.  She sees a good-looking MALE RUNNER
	coming toward her.  She has no hope that he will notice her,
	and starts to look away as they get close to one another.

			     MALE RUNNER
		Hi.

			     CHRISTINA
		Hi.

	He passes her.  Christina can't believe it.

	She does a little dance of joy.

	Camera pulls back as we see her by the reservoir on a 
	beautiful morning doing her little celebratory spin.

	Then she resumes her morning exercise, running on.

	INT. THE SINGLES TEMPLE - FRIDAY EVENING

	Patricia comes in.

	The place is packed.  There are hundreds of young Jewish New
	Yorkers singing folk songs and dancing the hora.  The Rabbi
	is dancing among them.

	Patricia sees the rabbi, leading the dance.

	The rabbi whirls madly toward her, like a human dreidel.

			     RABBIT
		Shabbat shalom!

	He grabs Patricia's hand, and to her surprise, they go
	whirling off together.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

	Kathleen at the computer, typing.

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I have been thinking about this and
		I think we should meet.

	She clicks the send button and then exits from American On
	Line.

	On her computer screen we now see the standard screen with
	several icons: American On-Line, Word, Recycle Bin, etc.

	She clicks Word.

	She goes to File: New.

	There are several choices of format.

	She stares at the choices.  Then she clicks Book format.

	A blank page appears in the computer.

	She starts to type:  "Once upon a time there was a little
	girl named..."

	She pauses for a moment and looks around the room.  She sees
	the flowers that Joe brought her.

	And then she types: "Daisy."

	As she goes on typing...

	INT. JOE' BOAT - NIGHT

	On Joe typing.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		We should meet.  And we will meet.  But
		I'm in the middle of a project that
		needs...
			(he pauses to think of the
			 right word)
		... tweaking.

	A look of calculation on his face.

	EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

	We can see Kathleen through the window, drinking a cup of
	coffee.

	And now we see Joe walk into Starbucks.  He waves at her,
	pretending surprise at seeing her.  Has he been watching the
	store and waiting for her to come in?  We'll never know.

	INT. STARBUCKS - A FEW MINUTES LATER

	He's sitting next to her at the counter in the window.

			     JOE
		Tweaking?

			     KATHLEEN
		That's what he said.

			     JOE
		He's probably married.

			     KATHLEEN
		That's a terrible thing to say.  It's not
		possible.

			     JOE
		Have you asked him if he's married?  Have
		you said, "Are you married?"

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

	Joe looks at her, shrugs.

	INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	As she types:

			     KATHLEEN (V.O.)
		I know this is probably a little late to
		be asking, but are you married?

	INT. JOE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	As he answers:

			     JOE (V.O.)
		Am I married?  What kind of a question is
		that?  How can you ask me that?  Don't
		you know me at all?  Oh wait, I get it.
		Your friends are telling you the reason
		we haven't met is that I'm married.  Am I
		right?

	INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - ANOTHER DAY

	Kathleen and Joe having nachos.

			     JOE
		So he didn't exactly answer.

			     KATHLEEN
		He did too.  He nailed me.  He knew
		exactly what I was up to.  Which is just
		like him.

			     JOE
		But he didn't exactly answer, did he?
		Did he?

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

			     JOE
		Maybe he's fat.

			     KATHLEEN
		I don't care about that.

			     JOE
		You don't care that he might be one of
		those guys who's so fat he has to be
		removed from his house with a crane?

			     KATHLEEN
		That's very unlikely.

			     JOE
		Why else do you think he's putting off
		meeting you?  Although... maybe that's
		not it.  Maybe...

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

			     JOE
		Never mind.

			     KATHLEEN
		What????

			     JOE
		He could be waiting til he's paroled.

			     KATHLEEN
		Oh, you won't believe this, there was a
		moment when George thought he might be
		the rooftop killer, which was completely
		ridiculous --

	Her voice trails off, as she considers whether it could be
	true.

			     JOE
		What's his handle?

	She shakes her head.

			     JOE
		Come on, I'm not going to write him.  Is
		that what you think?

			     KATHLEEN
		NY 152.

			     JOE
		One five two.  One hundred fifty two.
		Very interesting.  He's 152 years old.
		He has 152 hairs remaining on his head.
		He's had 152 moles removed and now he
		has 152 pockmarks.

	EXT. FARMER'S MARKET ON BROADWAY - LATER

	As they walk past tables of bread and flowers, etc.

			     JOE
		His combined college board scores.

			     KATHLEEN
		His IQ.

			     JOE
		The number of women he's slept with.

			     KATHLEEN
		The number of times he's seen The
		Godfather.

			     JOE
		That's the first good thing I've heard
		about him.

			     KATHLEEN
		His address.  No, no, no.  He would never
		do anything that prosaic.

	On Joe, looking a little wounded.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		The only thing I really care about
		besides the married thing... and the
		jail thing... is the boat thing.

			     JOE
		The boat thing?

			     KATHLEEN
		I could never be with anyone who has
		a boat.

			     JOE
		Oh.

			     KATHLEEN
		So that clinches it.  We'll never be
		together.  I'll take care of these.

	He picks up a mango, squeezes it.

			     JOE (cont'd)
		I could never be with anyone who likes
		Joni Mitchell.
			(singing, imitating Joni)
		"It's cloud's illusions I recall, I
		really don't know clouds at all."  
		What does that mean?

	Joe waits for Kathleen to say she likes Joni Mitchell.

	But Kathleen doesn't say anything.

	She starts intently picking over apples, trying to find some
	she wants.

			     JOE
		How's your book coming?

	EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

	As they walk away from the market, going uptown.

			     KATHLEEN
		There's a children's book editor I know,
		from the store, and she's excited to 
		read it.  When I finish it.  Who would 
		ever have thought I'd write?  I mean,
		if I didn't have all this free time, I
		would never have discovered --

	She stops, realizing what she's saying.

			     KATHLEEN (cont'd)
		The truth is, he was the one who made me
		start thinking about writing --

			     JOE
		Mister 152 Felony Indictments --

			     KATHLEEN
		Mister 152... insights into my soul.

			     JOE
		Yes.  Well.  Can't compete with that.

			     KATHLEEN
		Well.  I keep bumping into you.  Hope
		your mango's ripe.

			     JOE
		I think it is.  Want to bump into me
		Saturday?  Around lunchtime?

	EXT. COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT

	As Joe types.

			     JOE (V.O.)
		How about meeting Saturday?  The first
		day of spring.  4 P.M.  There's a place
		in Riverside Park at 88th Street where
		the path curves and when you come around
		the curve, you'll find me waiting.

	INT./EXT. SATURDAY - GREY'S PAPAYA - THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING

	Kathleen and Joe are putting mustard on their hot dogs.

			     JOE
		Today?

			     KATHLEEN
		Today.

			     JOE
		Whoa.

			     KATHLEEN
		I know.  In Riverside Park.

			     JOE
		Isn't that amazing?  Maybe I've seen him,
		and I don't even know it.

	EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

	As they walk uptown, eating their hot dogs and drinking
	papaya drinks.

			     JOE
		He could be the Zipper Man.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who's that?

			     JOE
		This guy on Amsterdam who repairs
		zippers.  You'll never have to buy new
		luggage.

			     KATHLEEN
		Stop teasing.

			     JOE
		Timing is everything.  He waited until
		you were primed.  Until you knew there
		was no other man you could ever love.

			     KATHLEEN
			(almost believe it)
		Yes.

			     JOE
		Sometimes I wonder...

			     KATHLEEN
		What?

	They stop walking, they look at each other.

			     JOE
		If I hadn't been Foxbooks and you hadn't
		been The Shop Around the Corner and we'd
		just met --

			     KATHLEEN
		Don't.

			     JOE
		I would have asked for your phone number
		and I wouldn't have been able to wait 24
		hours before calling and asking, "How
		about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie,
		for as long as we both shall live?"

			     KATHLEEN
			(almost a swoon)
		Joe...

			     JOE
		And then we would never have been at war.

			     KATHLEEN
		No.

			     JOE
		The only fight we'd ever have is what
		video to rent on Saturday night.

			     KATHLEEN
		Who fights about that?

			     JOE
		Some people.  Not us.

			     KATHLEEN
		We would never.

	A long beat.

			     JOE
		If only...

			     KATHLEEN
		Please.  I have to go.

	She doesn't move.

			     JOE
		Let me ask you something?  How come
		you'll forgive him for standing you
		up and you won't forgive me for a 
		little tiny thing like putting you
		out of business?

	Kathleen looks at him.  Shakes her head.

	They look at each other.

			     JOE
		Oh how I wish you would.

	It's all Kathleen can do not to forgive him.

	It's all Joe can do not to kiss her.

			     KATHLEEN
		I really do have to go.

			     JOE
		You don't want to be late.

	She's in agony.

	He turns and walks away.

	After a moment, she does too.

	EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

	As we see Kathleen come down the street and walk into her

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - LATER AFTERNOON

	As she comes toward the entrance to the park.

	EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

	As Kathleen comes down a path in the park, near 88th Street.

	She comes to a stop.

	Looks around.

	A young woman in running clothes passes by.

	A young father pushing a baby in one of those strollers
	runners use to push babies in.

	Kathleen looks at her watch.

	Suddenly she hears a noise.  A dog barking.

	And Brinkley comes around the corner.

			     VOICE
		Brinkley!  Brinkley!

	And hold on Kathleen as she sees.

	JOE

	And she starts to cry.

	And he comes to her.  And puts his arms around her.

			     JOE
		Don't cry, Shopgirl, don't cry.

			     KATHLEEN
		I wanted it to be you.  I wanted it to
		be you so badly.

	And as they kiss, we hold on them.

	And crane up and away as we see them, a couple kissing in the
	park on a beautiful spring day.

	A dog is leaping around them.

	And as we get further and further away from them, the screen
	turns into

	CYBERSPACE

	And the dog turns cartwheels and flipflops.

	And we tilt up to see the clouds and the sky

	and hear the sound of computer keys, clicking, clicking,
	clicking

          OVER BLACK comes the sound of deep HEAVING BREATHS. Moist
          FLESH FLAPPING accompaniment. Someone is beating off.
          A pause as the someone turns the page of a magazine.
          The beating off resumes at a quickened pace. The SQUEAKING of
          bed springs joins in.
          Another page is turned. Feverish THUMPING until a MALE VOICE
          lets out a quiet MOAN.
          The breathing gradually slows to normal and lets out a
          relieved sigh of finality.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    My name... is Nick.

          from the exertion...

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY

          ...sprawled on the bed, trousers around his ankles, a well

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    My last name, which I loath, is
                    Twisp.

          Nick pulls up his trousers and leaps off the bed. He pulls
          the drawer under his mattress out.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    The next thing you should know
                    about me is that I am obsessed with
                    sex.

          A view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly
          filed issues of Penthouse and Hustler. He puts the most
          recently utilized magazine in its place.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Lately, I have become morbidly
                    aware of my penis.

          Nick posing in front of the mirror, pants around his ankles
          again. He looks at himself from various angles.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Once a remote region accessed
                    indifferently for micturition, it
                    has developed overnight into a
                    gaudy Las Vegas of the body.

          We PAN DOWN, and where Nick's crotch is supposed to be, there
          is a hole in the screen leading us to...

          

                                                                     2.

          

          LAS VEGAS OF THE BODY
          The pulsing neon sign outside the club reads: NICK'S PENIS.
          We fly inside where we find a star-studded floor show.
          Drunken CONVENTIONEERS make out with STRIPPERS. A LEOPARD
          leaps through a burning HOOP on stage.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Nick typing on an obsolete PC.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I am entering the tenth grade at
                    St. Vitus Academy, which, I am
                    told, is the most rigorous prep
                    school in the East Bay. Hopefully I
                    will be invited to join Miss
                    Satron's English Literature class.

          A view of the books and CDs on his shelf.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I am a voracious reader and listen
                    to Frank Sinatra. So needless to
                    say, I am still a virgin.

          Follow the curser on the monitor as he types the words -

          STILL A VIRGIN.
          He pauses in thought, then continues.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I have yet to hold hands with a
                    girl, let alone have my winkie up
                    her wendell.

          INT. AIRPLANE (35,000 FT) - DAY

          WE MOVE down an airplane aisle, past PASSENGERS sleeping and
          chatting.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I am an only child except for my
                    big sister Joanie, who has left the
                    bosom of her family to sling hash
                    at 35,000 feet.

          We reach the end of the aisle, where a buxom twenty-
          something, JOANIE TWISP serves a beverage.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY

          Liver frying in a pan. ESTELLE TWISP, 43, cooks and puffs on
          a cigarette at the same time.

          

                                                                      3.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Mom gives driver's tests at the
                    Department of Motor Vehicles.
          Nick sits at the kitchen table reading the paper. He watches
          with nausea as Estelle piles liver onto his plate.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    She used to keep Dad up to date on
                    all the motor statutes he was
                    violating. This is one of the
                    reasons they got divorced.
          JERRY, early 40's, saunters in wearing a TRUCKERS DO IT IN
          OVERDRIVE shirt and boxers. His gut hangs over the elastic,
          but he is completely devoid of an ass.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Mom's boyfriend, Jerry is a long
                    distance trucker, though his
                    ultimate ambition is to be on state
                    disability.
          Jerry absently smacks Estelle's butt. Waddles over to the
          breakfast table. He snatches the Funnies from the paper in
          Nick's hands.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I've been struggling to think of a
                    commendable thing to say about
                    Jerry.
          Jerry gives an asinine chuckle at the cartoon. Nick glares.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    No luck. His grey matter registers
                    at cretin and the needle doesn't
                    budge.

          EXT. GEORGE TWISP'S HOME - DAY

          GEORGE TWISP, 41, scruffy and greying, waters the foliage
          outside the house with a high powered hose.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Dad is a copywriter for
                    agricultural magazines.
          In the drive, Nick slaves over the duty of washing the rims
          of his dad's BMW 325i.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    He'd like to own a more prestigious
                    model of BMW, but, as he often
                    reminds me, he is burdened with
                    crippling child support payments.

          

                                                                     4.

          
          Nick glances up and spots LACEY, 20, coming up the drive
          toward him in a weensy bikini. Her body has more outcroppings
          than the coastline of Albania.
          She continues past him and embraces George.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                       Lacey is Dad's latest bimbette. She
                       is twenty and a recently minted
                       alumna of Stanfort.
          Super:          (Stanfort Institute of Cosmetology)
          George and Lacey exchange saliva shamelessly. Nick turns his
          attention back to the Beamer.
          As the making out becomes heated groping, George's grip on
          the hose slackens.
          Nick gets blindsided by the jet of water.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY

          We're back with Nick as he types on his computer. He looks
          down at the tent in his boxers.

                                                      CUT TO:
          He pulls open the drawer again - the pornography collection.

          NICK'S POV
          of the room shaking, accompanied by his heavy breathing. His
          eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of his room.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                       My mother is the one who painted my
                       room to look like Dolly Parton's
                       boudoir. She read this color was
                       used in hospitals to calm mental
                       patients.
          Nick closes his eyes, his right arm moving rhythmically.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                       I'll tell you what I told her. I am
                       not mentally ill.
          BLACKNESS. The masturbation reaches its feverous climax. Then
          the long moan and sigh of relief.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                       I'm just a teenager.
          And as Frank Sinatra's UNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG
          begins, we go to OPENING CREDITS.

                             YOUTH IN REVOLT

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY

          Nick regards Jerry from across the dining room table. There
          is the off-screen sound of a cretin slurping Cheerios.
          Reveal Jerry reading Sports Illustrated, scratching his balls
          with one hand and shoveling in cereal with the other. Estelle
          is washing dishes when she spies something out the window.

                              ESTELLE
                    Jerry? Where did that car come
                    from?
          Jerry looks over his shoulder and they all take a moment to
          appreciate the slab-sided Lincoln in the drive.

                              JERRY
                    It's a '62 Lincoln convertible.
                    Like the one Kennedy was shot in.

                              NICK
                    Except his was black and yours is
                    white. And dirty.

                              JERRY
                    See that. I was going to take you
                    and your mom for a spin after
                    breakfast. But now I guess it'll
                    just be her and me. You have your
                    smart mouth to thank for that.

                              NICK
                    Damn it. I guess I'll just have to
                    hang out all alone at the book
                    depository.

                                JERRY
                    The what?

                              ESTELLE
                    Jerry, I don't understand. What
                    happened to the Chevy-Nova?

                              JERRY
                    Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda
                    Naval Air Base. A man should never
                    own a car for more than three
                    months, Estelle. That way he always
                    gets the thrill of owning a new
                    automobile!
          Jerry smiles with cretin pride. Nick looks to his mother and
          disturbingly enough, she seems turned on by his car-owner
          savvy.

          

                                                                     6.

          

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          Nick stands in the doorway watching as his mother waits for
          Jerry to open the passenger door for her.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    After spending twelve years with
                    Dad, Mom has had a string of
                    lovers, none of whom she has asked
                    me to approve.
          Jerry fails to notice Estelle waiting and instead just climbs
          in and chugs his beer. Estelle appears mildly disappointed
          before opening the door herself.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I'm starting to think her
                    boyfriends are like U.S.
                    Presidents.
          As Jerry pulls out, he tosses his beer bottle in the
          direction of the trash can at the end of the drive.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Just when you think they can't get
                    any worse...
          He misses and the bottle shatters on the pavement, but Jerry
          drives off anyway.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...she manages to find God's
                    Perfect Asshole.

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY


          ON A TV SCREEN
          Nick cycles through TiVo and finds the late night SEX
          DOCUMENTARY he recorded.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          From the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the
          jingle jangle of a belt buckle.
          Then the DING-DONG of the front doorbell.
          The jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a second
          time, the orgy gets muted.
          Nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers.

          I/E. ESTELLE'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER
          The door is opened to reveal two burly, tattooed SAILORS
          standing on the stoop.

          

                                                                      7.

          
          Their eyes drift to Nick's mid-section.
          Nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to
          fasten out of haste. He returns his gaze to the sailors as he
          wrangles the belt.

                              SAILOR #1
                    Is Jerry here?

                              NICK
                    He just left. What's up?

                              SAILOR #1
                    What's up is that hunk of shit
                    Chevy he sold us made it seventeen
                    miles before the engine blew up.

                              SAILOR #2
                    And we found evidence of a banana
                    in the transmission.
          The second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a
          plastic bag. Nick glances to drive and regards the smoking
          Chevy-Nova with its camouflage paint job.
          A THIRD SAILOR is rummaging through the boxes in the open
          garage. He finds some spray-paint and shakes the can.
          Nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop.

                              SAILOR #1
                    So he owes us nine hundred dollars.

                              NICK
                    Well, I think he used that nine
                    hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln.
                    He's giving my mom a joyride in it
                    now. But he'll be back this
                    afternoon, so I would come back
                    then. He's pretty stubborn. You
                    might have to beat it out of him.

                              SAILOR #1
                    That can be arranged. In the
                    meantime we're leaving the piece of
                    shit in the driveway. With a note.
          Nick looks one more time to the Chevy as the third sailor
          finishes painting the hood with the words: PAY UP OR DIE.

                               NICK
                    I like it. Very to the point.
                    Well... See you guys this
                    afternoon!
          The sailors nod, somewhat perplexed by this kid's demeanor.
          As they turn to go and Nick closes the door...

          

                                                                   8.

          

          

          

          

                              LEFTY (V.O.)
                    I might have to kill myself.

          EXT. HILLS ABOVE UC CAMPUS - DAY

          In the clearing, a UC JOCK stands behind his ASIAN
          GIRLFRIEND, kissing her neck and removing her clothes.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I hope you have a good reason.
          Reveal Nick and his friend LEFTY, 16, belly down in the grass
          overlooking the clearing. Lefty watches the copulating couple
          with a pair of binoculars.

                              LEFTY
                    My sister said she saw Millie
                    Filbert holding hands with some
                    college guy.

                              NICK
                    I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister
                    is just waging psychological
                    warfare.

                              LEFTY
                    Well it's working. What am I gonna
                    do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think
                    about Millie so much my balls ache.

                              NICK
                    Maybe your just not wacking off
                    enough.
          As if in response, Lefty passes the binoculars off to Nick
          and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants.
          As Lefty jerks it, Nick looks with nonchalance...

          THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
          The couple hump in the grass, her legs in the air.

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    So, I've been taping my pecker to
                    my right leg at night.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    In case you haven't heard, Lefty's
                    erect member takes a dramatic turn
                    midway up the shaft.

          

                                                                   9.

          

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    Then I look at this issue of Better
                    Homes and Gardens that has a girl
                    that looks just like Millie until
                    it gets good and hard. I think it's
                    starting to straighten out.

                              NICK
                    Why don't you just have your
                    parents take you to the dick
                    doctor?

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    Are you kidding? It would kill them
                    to know that I even get hard-ons.

                              NICK
                    Still, you might want to get it
                    fixed before asking Millie out.

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    True. What if I shove it up the
                    wrong hole?
          Nick gives a dubious glance in Lefty's direction.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Lefty's grasp of the female anatomy
                    is somewhat tenuous; he imagines
                    there are orifices galore down
                    there.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY


                              JERRY
                    Nick, you little shit, get down
                    here!
          Jerry hollers from the kitchen where Estelle gapes out the
          window. Nick calmly joins them from upstairs.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, do you know anything about
                    this?
          She points out the window and they all take in the Chevy and
          the sailors' oh-so-subtle note on the hood.

                              NICK
                    Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by.
                    They want their money back. I guess
                    there was a banana in the
                    transmission.

                              JERRY
                    You tell them when I was coming
                    back?

          

                                                                  10.

          

                              NICK
                    Now why would I do that?
          Jerry seeths inwardly at Nick's mock innocence.

                              ESTELLE
                    What are you going to do, Jerry?

                              JERRY
                    I think I'll go get the Lincoln
                    washed.

                              ESTELLE
                    You're leaving? What happens when
                    the sailor comes back for his nine-
                    hundred dollars?

                              JERRY
                    Just tell him he bought the car
                    with my standard guarantee. Thirty
                    days or thirty feet. Whichever
                    comes first. I'm in the right.
          And on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the
          simultaneous pounding of angry Navy fists on the back door.
          They peer out the window and find the fleet on the front
          steps.

                              NICK
                    Oh, look. The sailors are here.
          Jerry first starts to dart one way and then another,
          searching for a hiding space as he hisses.

                              JERRY
                    Get rid of them!
          And then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors
          pour in. Jerry flees. A HANDHELD CAM chase as he heads for
          the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in.
          Jerry bolts up the stairs.

                              NICK
                    Jerry, where are you going? Just
                    tell them you are in the right.

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - CONTINUOUS

          They manage to grab Jerry by the legs and haul him down the
          stairs. Jerry loses his grasp step by step, crying with a
          sound not unlike E.T. when the flashlight hit him in the
          cornfield.
          The two big guys with bad haircuts hold Jerry off the ground
          while the earnstwhile Chevy owner goes through his pockets.

          

                                                                     11.

          

                              SAILOR #1
                    Sixty-three lousy dollars.

                              JERRY
                    That's my life savings!
          One of the sailors pokes Jerry in the gut hard and he
          whimpers.

                              ESTELLE
                    Don't hurt him! Nick, call 911!

                              SAILOR #1
                    Touch that phone, kid, and you lose
                    your left nut.
          Nick raises his hands. "You don't have to tell me twice."

                              JERRY
                    Please. Please don't hurt me. It's
                    all I got, guys. I swear. Take the
                    Lincoln!

                              SAILOR #1
                    I don't want the Lincoln. I want my
                    nine-hundred dollars. I'm taking
                    the sixty-three, which means you
                    owe me another eight hundred and
                    thirty.

                              NICK
                    Eight hundred and thirty seven,
                    actually.

                              SAILOR #1
                    Exactly. Have it by tomorrow or
                    you'll be found in the trunk of
                    your new used piece of shit at the
                    bottom of the Bay.
          And with that they release him and Jerry crumples to the
          floor like an abandoned marionette.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

          The three of them watch the fleet pile into a Navy van that
          reads FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY. The moment they pull out, Jerry
          dusts himself off and puts on a pretense of being unfazed.

                              JERRY
                    Wow, those guys are even dumber
                    than I thought. They actually think
                    I'm stupid enough to let them
                    muscle me into paying.

          

                                                                  12.

          

                              ESTELLE
                    Jerry, what are you talking about?
                    We need to call the police!

                              JERRY
                    I'm not some tattle-tale like your
                    son.
          Nick rolls his eyes.

                              ESTELLE
                    Then for God's sake, Jerry, just
                    sell the Lincoln and pay them!

                              JERRY
                    Can't. It's in The Code.

                              ESTELLE
                    What code? The vehicular code?

                              JERRY
                    Code of the streets, Babe. Code of
                    the streets.

                              ESTELLE
                    Then what are you planning to do?
          Jerry takes a seat at the kitchen table and adopts The
          Thinker pose. He strokes his chin as Nick and Estelle await
          his brilliant solution with breathless anticipation.

          I/E. LINCOLN - DAY

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    We are going to Ukiah for a last
                    minute vacation.
          Jerry's got on a hat made from Coors beer cans. He's behind
          the wheel of his Lincoln convertible.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Jerry says we'll be staying in a
                    cabin on Clear Lake that's owned by
                    a friend of his.
          Estelle dumps in the cooking gear and closes the trunk. Her
          halter top looks like an advertisement for Droop City. Nick's
          in the back. Estelle waves at the neighbors like she's Miss
          Corn Dog of 1954.

                              ESTELLE
                    Goodbye, everyone! We're going on
                    vacation!

                              JERRY
                    Let's blow!

          

                                                                  13.

          
          She hops up front with Jerry. He fires up the Lincoln and the
          radio roars to life with HILLBILLY MUSIC.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I'm not sure how this is the
                    solution to his problem. But I've
                    decided to go along with it, seeing
                    as I'm not rooting for him anyway.
          As they pull out, Jerry tosses his beer bottle at the garbage
          can at the end of the drive and it once again misses and
          shatters on the street behind them.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          The Lincoln makes it's way upstate, and dips into the mist
          covered hills of Ukiah.

          EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

          They've pulled to a stop. Estelle stares in horror.

                              ESTELLE
                    Jerry...? You said it was a cabin.
          In the back, Nick removes his sunglasses to regard the long,
          green, turd of a trailer. Some concrete dwarves in the grass.
          A dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio. A decrepit
          picket fence with a sign that reads: MY GREEN HAVEN.
          Estelle looks as if she's about to cry. Jerry puts his arm
          around her.

                              JERRY
                    C'mon Estelle. It's real cute on
                    the inside.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

          Substitute cluttered for cute. The three of them are crammed
          around a dining surface as accommodating as an airplane tray
          table. 3-D religious art hangs on the wall above them.

                              JERRY
                    I say the kid does the dishes and
                    we retire to the master bedroom.
          Jerry pushes out and disappears into the back. Nick watches
          him with loathing. Estelle smiles apologetically.

                              NICK
                    Mom? Do you really like Jerry?
          Her smile fades.

          

                                                                   14.

          

                                ESTELLE
                    Nick, how   many men do you think
                    there are   who'd be interested in a
                    forty-one   year old woman with two
                    brats, no   money, and stretch marks?
          And with that she excuses herself, leaving Nick to ponder.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Mom is a realist about everything.
                    Except her age. She's forty-three.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - LATER

          Nick washes dishes in the toilet-like sink. The trailer
          shakes from the two adults flogging the mattress in the back.

          EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

          An old crone, MRS. SAUNDERS, makes her way up the walk. She
          gets to the door of My Green Haven and bangs on the screen.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick sleeps on a pull out cot. He bolts upright at the
          banging, his hair going in all directions.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS (O.S.)
                    It's your neighbor, Mrs. Saunders.
                    Church services begin at seven
                    fifteen prompt. Donuts will be
                    served.
          Nick glances down at the morning wood elevating his boxers.
          Mrs. Saunders narrows her eyes at Nick through the screen
          door and takes off.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick steps out of the trailer in a bathrobe, toiletries in
          one hand, towel in the other. He heads off down the wooded
          path.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          The serene melodies of rousing HYMNS float from the well-
          attended congregation in the meeting hall.
          WE TRACK across the trees as Nick makes his way down the
          path. He slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy
          overhead. He glances off the path and comes to a sudden stop.
          A grape arbor flanked by Corinthian columns set against the
          blue of Clear Lake. A chestnut haired SHEENI SAUNDERS stands
          facing the water, her head tilted down to read the book in
          her hands. The wind coming off the lake blows her dress just
          enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath.

          

                                                                     15.

          
          Light falls in shafts through the latticework of the arbor
          like something out of a FranÃ§ois Boucher painting.

                                 NICK (V.O.)
                       The moment I see her I know the
                       Gods, while having cruelly endowed
                       me with imperfect posture and pussy
                       postponing pimples, had put me here
                       for a purpose. My heart palpitates.
                       My mind races. I get an instant

                       T.E.
          Super:                (Thundering Erection)
          Sheeni glances up from her book and looks over her shoulder
          at him. Nick just stares. She gives an amused smile, almost
          flirtatious. Nick grins back.

                                 SHEENI
                       Your robe is open.
          Nick looks down. He pulls the robe closed, scowls, and goes
          into a flustered march down the path.

          INT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY

          An austere   cement shed with three dripping shower heads and
          no privacy   walls. Nick lathers up under the spray. Jerry
          appears in   the foreground and removes his robe. He goes to
          the shower   head next to Nick and turns it on.
          Nick reacts to Jerry and hastily tries to resume rinsing
          himself off. Jerry gurgles water and spits. He starts
          warbling rock lyrics.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick comes up the path and stops short at the picket fence.
          Estelle and Sheeni squat on the patio steps.

                                 SHEENI
                       Hel-lo, Excitable Boy.

                                 ESTELLE
                       Nick, honey, meet Sheeni Saunders.

                                  NICK
                       Hello.

                                 ESTELLE
                       Sheeni needs to go to the grocery
                       store. I've offered her your help
                       in carrying her bags.
          Nick regards Sheeni and her mischievous smirk.

          

                                                                  16.

          

                              NICK
                    Thanks a pantsful.

          EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

          A dusty road. Nick totes a watermelon and a paper bag. He
          watches as Sheeni works on a Popsicle. Full lips that cry out
          to be kissed.

                              NICK
                    You don't have to go to services?

                              SHEENI
                    No. Much to the consternation of my
                    fanatical parents I have converted
                    to atheism. Fortunately my brother,
                    Paul, paved the way for such
                    transgressions.

                              NICK
                    Paul is an atheist too?

                              SHEENI
                    Buddhist, I believe, though we have
                    not seen him in some time. I myself
                    am looking forward to being free of
                    parental bondage.

                                NICK
                    Likewise.

                              SHEENI
                    Well, your mother seems very nice,
                    though your father I think might be
                    rather dim.

                              NICK
                    Jerry and I share no blood links of
                    any kind.
          As they pass the meeting hall there comes a surge of HYMNS in
          chorus.

                              NICK
                    Sounds rather zealous.

                              SHEENI
                    Yes, even though I am no longer a
                    believer I always found the
                    services wonderfully aerobic.

                              NICK
                    You could say the same thing about
                    sex.
          Sheeni stops. She looks at Nick intently.

          

                                                                    17.

          

                              SHEENI
                    Nick, are you going to turn out
                    like all the other young men and
                    have nothing on your mind except
                    carnal pleasures?

                              NICK
                    I hardly ever think about sex.

                              SHEENI
                    Really? I think about it all the
                    time. It's the hormones at work,
                    you know.
          She resumes walking. Nick follows her with confusion.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          They regard the two story Pacemaker mobile home.

                              NICK
                    Wow. A second floor.

                              SHEENI
                    Yes. Father bought it so that he
                    could look down upon the world. For
                    him, Christian humility has always
                    been a struggle.
          Sheeni relieves him of the watermelon.

                              SHEENI
                    Well, it was nice to meet you,
                    Nick.
          She trudges down the slate path to the home.

                              NICK
                    Sheeni? Do you want to come to the
                    beach with me?
          She turns around. Gives a little smirk.

                              SHEENI
                    What a thoughtful invitation. I'd
                    love to, Nick. Wait for me in the
                    living room.

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          A lot more space than My Green Haven. Dark paneling and
          somewhat more tasteful religious art.

                              SHEENI
                    Back in a moment.

          

                                                                  18.

          
          Nick watches her bound up the stairs.
          He wanders into the musty living area. Moves down the mantel
          examining the trinkets. Stops to regard the reproduction of
          Massaccio's Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden on the wall.
          He scrutinizes the image, his eyes falling to the privates of
          Adam and Eve.

                              MR. SAUNDERS (O.S.)
                    I understand you have invited my
                    daughter to the beach.
          Nick spins around to see MR. SAUNDERS reclining in his
          armchair. He is an immense, florid-faced, verdant eye-browed
          ogre in a rumpled blue suit.

                              NICK
                    Er, yes, Mr. Saunders.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    Aha! Then I trust, sir, you are
                    aware that in doing so you have
                    entered into an oral contract to
                    perform in loco parentis, i.e. to
                    provide for the safety and well-
                    being of aforementioned minor
                    female.

                              SHEENI (O.S.)
                    Oh, Father, do shut up.
          Sheeni descends the stairs. Jean cut-offs over a knockout
          yellow swimsuit that shows off her flowing nubility.
          Mr. Saunders grumbles. Sheeni grabs up a straw beach bag and
          pushes Nick out the door.

                              SHEENI
                    Let's go, Nick. Bye, Father.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    Vaya con Dios!

          EXT. BEACH - DAY

          Sheeni and Nick lay on their backs on the blue beach blanket,
          reading their respective books. Nick watches her turning
          pages and making notes in the margins. She hands him her
          tanning lotion.

                              SHEENI
                    Would you mind applying this to my
                    exposed areas?

                              NICK
                    Not at all.

          

                                                                  19.

          
          She rolls over onto her stomach, exposing her exquisite back.
          Nick straddles her, hands shaking as he smooths sweet oils
          into her tanned flesh.

                              SHEENI
                    My, you get turned on easily.
          Nick's hands freeze.

                              SHEENI
                    Oh, don't stop, Nick. We all have
                    our hormones to deal with. Girls
                    are fortunate in that it doesn't
                    show. For all the world knows, my
                    vagina could be moist with desire
                    as we speak.

                                 NICK
                    Is it?

                              SHEENI
                    That's none of your business, I'm
                    sure. Shall you do my front too?

                              NICK
                    I'm up for it.
          She rolls over onto her back, her young breasts straining up
          against the yellow spandex.

                              SHEENI
                    I hope you don't find it too
                    stimulating, Nick.

                              NICK
                    I'm coping.
          He starts in on her flawless legs, gliding on the oil all the
          way within a finger's reach of her sweet apex.
          With each daring pass, he comes closer to that final split.
          Finally the hand swerves too late, and lightly grazes the
          softly yielding vee.

                              SHEENI
                    Uh, Nick. Maybe you better do the
                    top now.
          Nick moves up, lubricating her arms, shoulders and neck. He
          smooths the oil on the soft undulating foothills.

                              SHEENI
                    Thanks, Nick.

          

                                                                  20.

          
          She rolls back onto her stomach with finality and goes back
          to her book. Nick hovers above her a moment, then painfully
          returns to his own reading.

          EXT. RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

          They make their way down the path. Nick totes the beach bag.

                              SHEENI
                    Breathless is one of my favorite
                    films, though it might be eclipsed
                    by Rebel Without a Cause. I often
                    wonder what American cinema would
                    be like today had Dean done more
                    than three.
          Nick nods, and for a beat they trek on in silence. He glances
          down at her hand and fumbles for it with his own.

                              SHEENI
                    Oh, Nick. You seem very nice. But
                    in fairness, I should tell you that
                    I have a boyfriend.
          Nick becomes sickeningly pale.

                              NICK
                    What's his name?

                              SHEENI
                    Trent Preston.

                              NICK
                    What's he like?

                              SHEENI
                    Seventeen years of age, six-two,
                    fluent in French, plays the piano,
                    a champion swimmer, and writes
                    Futurist Percussive poetry.
          They stop at the gate to the Saunders' home.

                              NICK
                    I'm not familiar with Futurist
                    Percussive poems.

                              SHEENI
                    I could recite one of Trent's if
                    you'd like.

                                 NICK
                    Please do.
          She takes a dramatic pause.

          

                                                                   21.

          She gives a slightly amused smile at Nick's blank expression.

                              NICK (V.O.)

          TIME LAPSE of Nick thrashing about in bed. During this
          montage there is the constant ticking of a clock.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Here is an hour by hour account of
                    the worst night of my life.
          Nick flipping through a Penthouse under the covers.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    1 AM. I decide it is just a case of
                    puppy love and look forward to the
                    interesting women I shall meet in
                    the future.

          Nick at the dining table, writing a note.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    2 AM. I conclude the only way out
                    is suicide. I begin to pen a
                    poignant suicide note. Sheeni will
                    see Trent for the shallow pedant he
                    is and always treasure my memory.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    3 AM. I decide I am too chicken for
                    any of the manly, violent means of
                    suicide. I shall swallow sleeping
                    pills. Where to get them, though?

          

                                                                  22.

          

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

          Nick is in bed jerking off. The trailer shakes despite his
          best efforts.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    4 AM. I can not die an inviolate
                    virgin. Either I find a way to get
                    laid soon or suicide gets postponed
                    until after high school.

                              JERRY (O.S.)
                    You wanna beat your meat, go
                    outside!

          INT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY

          Nick in the shower going to town on his T.E.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    5 AM. It will be too painful to see
                    Sheeni again. I shall ask Mom if we
                    can cut our vacation short and
                    return to Oakland.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick rolls over on the cot and looks up with the gaze of a
          manic insomniac.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    6 AM. Violent panic! I have to see
                    Sheeni again!

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          The door opens to reveal Nick standing outside in shorts, an
          I'M SINGLE, LET'S MINGLE shirt, and tennis shoes. Sheeni
          stands in the door. Sleep-fogged eyes.

                              NICK
                    Good morning!

                              SHEENI
                    Nick? God what time is it?

                              NICK
                    Seven o'clock. How about breakfast?

                              SHEENI
                        (smiling with endearment)
                    Come back in two hours. I'm going
                    on a hike. You can join me if you'd
                    like.
          She closes the door.

          

                                                                     23.

          
          Super:     One hour fifty seven minutes later
          A knock on the door. Sheeni opens it to reveal... Nick,
          dressed the same. Sheeni wears Khakis, red bandanna
          neckerchief, and an Australian bush hat. She looks like the
          world's most desirable Girl Scout. She examines Nick's
          attire.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick, where are your hiking boots,
                    water bottle, provisions, survey
                    maps and compass?

                              NICK
                    Like John Muir I enter the
                    wilderness with nothing more than
                    my journal and a childlike sense of
                    wonder.

                              SHEENI
                    Okay, but I have no plans to baby
                    any slackers.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Sheeni leads the way up hill. Nick clutches his cramped
          stomach with one hand, his journal in the other.
          He watches the rhythmic movements of her ass through her
          hiking shorts.

          EXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - DAY

          Nick and Sheeni peer over the edge of the cliff. The waters
          of Clear Lake churn below.

                              NICK
                    Quite a drop.

                              SHEENI
                    Yes. Not to be morbid, but this
                    sight has been the chosen means of
                    at least three teen suicides.

                              NICK
                    Huh. Quite a hike just to end your
                    life.

                              SHEENI
                    Well, there is a road. But I agree.
                    Adolescents have a tendency toward
                    the over-dramatic.
          Sheeni backs away. Nick stays, staring over the edge.

          

                                                                    24.

          

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Nick's eyes roll back as he relieves himself against a tree.
          He shakes off the last of it and zips up.

          EXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - LATER

          He emerges from the woods only to find Sheeni reading his
          journal. She looks up at his and smiles. The brazen sneak
          isn't even embarrassed.

                              NICK
                    That's my journal!

                              SHEENI
                    Don't get so upset Nick. Though
                    your handwriting is egregious, you
                    have a fairly decent vocabulary.
                    Although, Trent is not an "affected
                    twit."
          Nick snatches the journal out of her hands.

                              NICK
                    Those are my private thoughts and
                    are none of your business!

                              SHEENI
                    Nick?

                              NICK
                    What?

                              SHEENI
                    The lengths you say you are willing
                    to go to to win my heart, the
                    contemplation of suicide at the
                    thought of not having me...
                        (taking a sensual breath)
                    It all evokes a strong emotional
                    warmth in my breast.
          Nick can only stare at her sprawled out on her back as if
          posing for a centerfold.

                              SHEENI
                    Did you mean it, Nickie?
          A beat as he is lost in the ocean of her gaze before he
          manages to gain his senses.

                              NICK
                    How would you like it if I read
                    your journal?

                              SHEENI
                    You can read it if you'd like.

          

                                                                     25.

          
          She hands it over. Nick squints at the writing.

                              NICK
                    It's in French.

                              SHEENI
                    A necessity for a child in a
                    household with prying Christian
                    parents.

                              NICK
                    What does it say?

                              SHEENI
                    Wouldn't you like to know. That
                    last passage would be of particular
                    interest to you.
          Nick leaps on top of her, grabbing her thin wrists. She
          squeals and giggles.

                              NICK
                    Spill it! I demand full disclosure!

                              SHEENI
                    Never!
          They wrestle, perspiring, squirming bodies brushing together.
          Flashing super:        Thundering Erection
          They pause. He's got her arms pinned. She's on her back. He
          hovers above her.

                              SHEENI
                        (softly chanting)
                    Nickie's got a hard-on.
          Nick considers her expression.

                              SHEENI
                    You're still a virgin, I can tell.
                    Maybe that's why I like you.
          A beat. She looks at him expectantly. Nick is at a loss.

                              SHEENI
                    Kiss me, you wienie.
          Nick tentatively approaches her luscious mouth. Their noses
          dodge successfully and their lips meet.
          After a long moment, they break it off. Staring into each
          other's eyes. Sheeni jumps up.

          

                                                                     26.

          

                              SHEENI
                    Okay, lover. Break's over. Let's
                    go!
          Nick lays in the grass a moment, watching after her.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          Nick walks Sheeni to the gate. She turns around to face him.

                              NICK
                    When can I see you again?

                              SHEENI
                    Get up early tomorrow and you can
                    shower with me in the ladies room.
                    Five minutes to six. If you dare.
          Nick grins with excitement.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

          Nick dines at the tray table with Jerry and Estelle.

                              ESTELLE
                    So what's this Sheeni girl like?

                              NICK
                    She's the Encyclopedia Britannica.

                              JERRY
                    She's got a nice rack.

                              ESTELLE
                    Jerry!
          Jerry chuckles. Nick stares at him, perhaps resolving to
          murder the trucker in his sleep.

          INT. MY GREEN HAVEN - LATER

          Nick lies below us on the cot, unable to sleep with the
          anticipation of the imminent loss of his virginity.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT/DAY

          Another perfect California summer dawn, a pale moon lingering
          in the blue morning sky. Nick emerges from My Green Haven in
          his robe. He starts off down the path.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          The trailer park is relatively silent save for birds and the
          distant sound of dogs barking.

          

                                                                     27.

          

          EXT. PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY

          Nick approaches the shower building. As he nears, the sound
          of water running can be heard from the ladies' side.

          INT. PUBLIC REST ROOM (WOMEN'S SIDE) - DAY

          The women's side has real stalls and privacy doors. Nick
          spots the chamber at the end where Sheeni's naked form
          showers, obscured by tacky stained glass.
          He kicks off his slippers. Hangs his robe on a hook.
          He approaches the stall.
          Flashing super:       Thundering Erection
          He opens the shower door and steps into the steamy spray.
          He embraces her. Pendulous breasts, sagging skin, a patch of
          white hair under a drooping belly, wrinkles... It's Mrs.
          Saunders! She looks up startled.
          Nick lets out a horrible woman-like scream. Mrs. Saunders
          starts screaming too, the sound of a pig being slaughtered.
          She hurls a bar of soap.
          The bar strikes Nick upside the head and he loses his footing
          on the slippery tile. He goes down, taking Mrs. Saunders with
          him. They wrangle in the mist as Nick tries to escape.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS

                    RAPE! RAAAAAPE!
          Suddenly the door opens. It's Sheeni in her robe. She reaches
          out and pulls Nick up.

                              SHEENI
                    Get out quick!
          Still wearing her robe, she dives into the spray to save her
          mother. Nick grabs his robe and retreats.

          INT. CAFE - DAY

          Nick slouches in a corner of the shop, his hands trembling as
          he brings his coffee to his lips. He hears the door open and
          looks up, but instead of the cops finds Sheeni. She joins him
          at the table.

                              NICK
                    Should I go to the sheriff's now?

                              SHEENI
                    No. I managed to convince Mother
                    you were retarded and couldn't read
                    the sign.

          

                                                                     28.

          
          Nick nods thankfully.

                              NICK
                    Say, where were you anyway?   We
                    said five minutes to six.

                              SHEENI
                    I'm sorry. But, Nick, women are
                    always discreetly late. It's
                    expected of us.

                              NICK
                    Swell. And the punctual guy fries
                    in the chair for rape.

                              SHEENI
                    Don't complain. At least you got to
                    shower with a naked woman.
                        (licking donut powder off
                         her fingers)
                    What are your plans today?

                              NICK
                    My parents want to go to
                    Middletown. Jerry has the moronic
                    notion of buying a trailer there
                    before we leave.

                              SHEENI
                    I should like to come with you,
                    Nick. The more time we spend
                    together the better. I fear when
                    you leave we might never see each
                    other again.
          Nick nods glumly. Clearly a devastating thought.

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

          Sheeni's in back with Nick, but doesn't seem to mind the wind
          tunnel. She has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks.
          Nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside of
          his thigh.
          As they round a curve at 60, she yanks Nick's sunglasses off
          and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake.

          EXT. GEEZER'S MANOR - DAY

          Estelle, Jerry, Nick, and a toothless old GEEZER whose gut
          rivals Jerry's, all stare at a rusty RV that looks like it
          might not make the trip back.
          In the background, Sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard.

          

                                                                     29.

          

                              JERRY
                    What's your cash price?

                              GEEZER
                    I said in the ad. Thousand dollars
                    firm.

                               JERRY
                    Thousand, huh? That must be with a
                    guarantee.

                              GEEZER
                    As is, where she is.

                              JERRY
                    I don't know. Those rusty propane
                    tanks are a fire hazard. The roof
                    probably needs work. I couldn't go
                    above eight hundred.
          The geezer ponders the bad news. Estelle shakes her head and
          goes inside the RV to inspect.

                              ESTELLE (O.S.)
                    There are mouse droppings in all
                    the closets, Jerry.

                              GEEZER
                    I might take nine fifty.

                              JERRY
                    Nine hundred.
          Sheeni lets out a squeal of delight. They all turn their
          attention to where she has discovered a box full of squirming

          PUPPIES.
          She brings one of them over.

                              SHEENI
                    Look, Nick!
          She shows him the ugly little pug. Short droopy ears, a tiny,
          batlike face.

                              NICK
                    Great.

                              SHEENI
                        (to the geezer)
                    How much?

                              GEEZER
                    Ten dollars.
          Sheeni turns to Nick pleadingly. Nick fishes through his
          wallet.

          

                                                                  30.

          

                              NICK
                    All I have is a Subway card with
                    four stickers.

                              GEEZER
                    Sold.

                              NICK
                    No doubt close to the dog's actual
                    value.

                              SHEENI
                    Oh, thank you, Nickie!
          She plants a kiss on his lips and promptly turns her
          attention to the dog, who licks her face affectionately. Nick
          looks on with appropriate jealousy.

                              SHEENI
                    I'm going to name him Albert.
                        (pronounced Al-bear)

                              GEEZER
                    That don't sound like any kind of
                    name for a dog.

                              SHEENI
                        (scowling defensively)
                    I'll have you know I've named him
                    after the deceased French writer,
                    Albert Camus. Author of L'Etranger
                    and other works of existential
                    brilliance.
          The geezer looks to Nick with an expression of "I stand
          corrected." Nick returns with a nod that says "You have no
          idea."

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

          The Lincoln now tows the rusty RV behind it. Nick watches
          Sheeni continue to fawn over Albert.

          INT. CAFE - DAY

          Nick and Sheeni dine over coffee and a plate of donuts. Nick
          watches her play with Albert in her lap.

                              NICK
                    Sheeni, I think I love you.

                              SHEENI
                    Well, your hormones certainly do.
                    And oddly enough, my hormones like
                    you too.

          

                                                                  31.

          
          Sheeni releases Albert and the mutt paws at her legs. Her
          eyes well up with tears, a few theatrical sniffles.

                              NICK
                    Sheeni? It's... It's okay. We can
                    visit each other when I get a
                    drivers license.

                              SHEENI
                    I hope that's true, but.. It's not
                    that. It's...

                              NICK
                    What?

                              SHEENI
                    It's my parents. They're... I fear
                    they will never allow me to keep
                    Albert.

                              NICK
                    Oh.
          Nick tries to hide his hurt. Picks up the paper with
          annoyance.

                              SHEENI

                        (SNIFFLING)
                    Nick, honey. Why don't you take
                    Albert? He could be our love child.

                              NICK
                    No way.

                              SHEENI
                    At least you could consider it,
                    honey. For me. I've never asked you
                    for anything before.

                              NICK
                    Maybe I could take him, but I'd
                    have certain conditions. I would
                    have to be the only dad on the
                    scene.
                        (matter of fact)
                    Trent would have to go.

                              SHEENI
                    That's asking a lot. Trent worships
                    the ground I walk on.

                              NICK
                    It's your choice. Life with me and
                    the dog you love. Or a pet-free
                    existence with a shallow,
                    egotistical poet.

          

                                                                  32.

          
          Sheeni ponders this.

                              SHEENI
                    OK, Nick, I guess I don't have any
                    choice. I'll break up with Trent.
                    But if he kills himself it's on
                    your conscience.

                              NICK
                    I accept full responsibility.

                              SHEENI
                    Well, good, that's settled.

                              NICK
                    Not quite, darling. I want one more
                    thing.

                                 SHEENI
                    What?

                              NICK
                    What do you think?
          A beat. Sheeni looks pensive. It fades to amusement.

                              SHEENI
                    Do you have a condom?
          Nick lifts his eyebrows. Now we're getting somewhere!

                              SHEENI
                    It has to be in a safe place. A
                    nice comfortable bed. With no
                    threat of interruptions. And for
                    relaxation and mood setting some
                    good red wine, preferably French. I
                    want a new condom. Not one that's
                    been riding around in your wallet
                    for years. Consumers rated them a
                    while back. I suggest you get their
                    top-rated brand. This may take some
                    research in the library. I'd
                    appreciate a photocopy of the
                    article. Plus, for supplementary
                    protection, I want a name brand
                    spermicide.

                              NICK
                    How about I have a quick vasectomy
                    just to be on the safe side?

                              SHEENI
                        (matter of fact)
                    Well, Nick, that, of course, is up
                    to you.

          

                                                                      33.

          
          Nick looks displeased that his sarcasm didn't register.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Jerry hitches the trailer to the back of the Lincoln. Estelle
          loads up the trunk.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni.
                    It's time to hit the road.
          Nick watches Sheeni kiss Albert. He looks less than enthused
          at the thought of sloppy-seconds. Finally Sheeni hands Nick
          the dog.
          Nick and Sheeni stand there an awkward beat. Sheeni leans in
          and gives him a peck on the cheek.

                              SHEENI
                        (whispering in his ear)
                    Don't forget, darling. Red wine and
                    Consumer Reports.
          She smiles. They're the sexiest words Nick's ever heard.
          He grabs her and kisses her deeply.
          Jerry HONKS the horn and they break off.

          INT. LINCOLN - DAY

          Nick gets into the back seat with Albert. The dog whimpers.
          Sheeni stands off to the side, waving at them both.

                              JERRY
                    Okay. Back to civilization!
          He fires up the Lincoln and they kick up dust. Albert
          slobbers all over Nick.
          Nick sets him down and watches Sheeni in the side-mirror,
          waving in the road.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I have a tall mountain to climb,
                    with many treacherous glaciers
                    still to cross, but finally, I have
                    obtained a stamped entry visa to
                    the paradise that lay beyond.
          Sheeni watches the Lincoln and trailer recede toward the
          horizon.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    In short... I have a very real
                    prospect for getting laid.

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

          

                                                                  34.

          

          

          

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          The Lincoln and RV slow to a stop outside the home.

          I/E. LINCOLN - DAY
          They all stare at the empty space where the Chevy-Nova used
          to be. Jerry gets a smirk of satisfaction.

                              JERRY
                    You see that, Babe. They caved.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          Jerry backs the RV into the drive as Nick helps his mother
          with her belongings and they enter the house. The RV scrapes
          its way through a few overhanging tree branches before Jerry
          decides it's parked.
          There comes a woman's scream from inside the house.

          INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Jerry joins Nick and Estelle in the doorway. There in the
          living room, surrounded by all the furniture pushed neatly
          against the walls, is Jerry's camouflaged Chevy.

                              NICK
                    I guess they didn't cave after all.
          Jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle.

                              JERRY
                    Boy, everything's complete. There's
                    even water in the windshield
                    washer.

                              ESTELLE
                    How did they ever get it in here?
                    My front door can't be more than
                    three feet wide.

                              JERRY
                    Looks like they brought it in piece
                    by piece and then reassembled it.

                              ESTELLE
                    But it would take an army of
                    mechanics to do all that!
          Jerry slams down the hood.

                              JERRY
                    Or a navy, Babe. Or a navy.

          

                                                                  35.

          

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          A cab pulls up in front of the house and Nick's sister,
          Joanie gets out of the back. She tips the driver, and as she
          crosses the front yard, gawks at the RV sitting in the drive.

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

          Nick's door is ajar. Nick pulls up his trousers and comes
          into the hall. He listens to the voices downstairs.

          STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
          He comes down the first few steps and is met with the sight
          of his mother and sister staring up at him.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, your sister came all the way
                    from LA for a weekend visit!
          Nick and Joanie meet eyes. She lifts a quizzical eyebrow.

                                NICK
                    Stellar.

          INT. ESTELLE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Albert chews on Jerry's sock under the table.

                              JERRY
                    Can someone do something about the
                    mutt?
          The family dines over take-out fried chicken. Jerry kicks
          Albert and the puppy goes tumbling across the floor.

                              ESTELLE
                    I don't know, Jerry. Can someone do
                    something about the monstrosity
                    dripping oil in my living room?

                              JOANIE
                    Yeah, I noticed that. What's the
                    story?

                              NICK
                    Jerry tried to outsmart a few
                    sailors. It's been an amusing saga.
          Jerry contemplates smacking Nick upside the head, but decides
          against it when he discerns Estelle is probably in her son's
          corner.

                              JERRY
                    OK, Babe, I guess when I come back
                    from my next haul I'll just have to
                    take it apart piece by piece.

          

                                                                  36.

          
          Estelle takes a deep breath and tries to let the matter rest.

                              JOANIE
                    Up to anything scandalous these
                    days, Nick?

                              NICK
                    I was going to ask you the same
                    thing.

                              JOANIE
                    What do you mean?
          Nick puffs out his chest. Joanie looks down at her boob-job.

                              JOANIE
                    Not that it's any of your business,
                    but I've taken a class to improve
                    my posture.
          Nick rolls his eyes.

                              ESTELLE
                    I think Joanie looks very nice. And
                    she has a new boyfriend too.

                              NICK
                    Did you meet him in posture class?

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick met a nice girl in Ukiah.

                              JOANIE
                    Really now? Are you on each others'
                    Myspace pages?

                              NICK
                    Hardly. Sheeni believes the
                    internet will be the end of
                    literacy.

                              JOANIE
                    So it's to be a torturous snail
                    mail exchange, huh?

                              NICK
                    More like the occassional collect
                    call.

                              ESTELLE
                    Collect calls? And just who do you
                    expect to pay for that?
          Jerry kicks the dog away from his sock. Albert growls and
          prepares for another charge.

          

                                                                    37.

          

                              JERRY
                    Hey, Nick. Want to learn how a car
                    is put together?

                              NICK
                    No, thanks. Auto mechanics doesn't
                    interest me.

                              JERRY
                    See, Estelle, I told you the kid
                    was queer-eeAAAAHHHHH!
          Jerry lurches backward in the chair and lands on the floor,
          revealing that Albert's teeth have a firm grasp on Jerry's
          sack. The dog shakes the scrotum in his jaws.

                              JERRY
                    Damn it! The dog!
          He tries to swipe Albert with his beer bottle, but the dog
          retreats into the house, leaving Jerry rolling around on the
          floor.
          Joanie and Nick exchange a smile. The phone rings. Estelle
          gets up to answer it.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, put the dog in the basement.

          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

          Nick stoops to secure the leash around the piping. He regards
          the little pug. Albert WHIMPERS and cocks his head.
          The door at the top of the stairs opens and Estelle descends
          the first few steps.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, that was your father on the
                    phone. He lost his job.

                              NICK
                    How unlike him.

                              ESTELLE
                    Watch your smart mouth. This means
                    the end of child support.

                              NICK
                    Which means...

                              ESTELLE
                    You'll have to start going to...

                        (DISTORTED)
                    Oakland Public School.
          In Nick's eyes the fear of a sentence worse than death.

          

                                                                  38.

          

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

          Morning comes through the drapes. The phone on the side table
          is ringing. Nick emerges from his room and picks it up.

                              NICK
                    Hello?

                              OPERATOR (V.O.)
                    Will you accept a collect call from
                    Sheeni Saunders?

                              NICK
                    Absolutely.
          Nick looks around, opens the door to the linen closet and
          darts inside.

          INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

          BLACKNESS. Then Nick pulls the cord and the naked bulb kicks
          on.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    Nick?

                              NICK
                    Sheeni? How are you?

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    I'm well, Nickie.

                              NICK
                    And how is Trent? Not too suicidal
                    I hope.

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          Sheeni relaxes on a love seat, cradling the phone with her
          shoulder as she eats grapes from a bowl. WE INTERCUT.

                              SHEENI
                    Of course, he was disconsolate, but
                    we talked all day and he's come to
                    see this as an opportunity for
                    growth. Oh, and Nick, Trent wanted
                    me to tell you that he bears you no
                    ill will.

                              NICK
                    Nor I him. I wish him all the best.

                              SHEENI
                    His parents are sending him to a
                    French speaking boarding school
                    this year. He's sure to get along
                    there. So how is my darling Albert?

          

                                                          39.

          

                              NICK
                    Well, though he's taken a disliking
                    to Jerry.

                              SHEENI
                    And you, Nickie? How are you?

                              NICK
                    I regret, Love of My Life, my
                    father has lost his job and I will
                    now be forced to go to public
                    school.

                              SHEENI
                    How unfortunate. What did he do?

                              NICK
                    He's a writer - sort of. He writes
                    advertising copy.

                              SHEENI
                    Really?
                        (pensive beat)
                    Nick, I suggest we look at your
                    father's firing as a blessing in
                    disguise.

                              NICK
                    How so?

                              SHEENI
                    I propose we get your father a job
                    here in Ukiah and you can come and
                    live with him.

                              NICK
                    Brilliant. Not that I'm fond of
                    Ukiah, but I'd live in a drainage
                    culvert to be with you.

                              SHEENI
                    Oh, Nickie. Now, I happen to know
                    Progressive Plywood is looking for
                    an assistant editor. It would be
                    perfect for your father.
          Nick furrows his brow with skepticism.

                              NICK
                    I had no idea you had knowledge of
                    the employment opportunities of
                    trade magazines.

                              SHEENI
                    The owner is the father of a friend
                    of mine.

          

                                                                  40.

          

                              NICK
                    Anyone I know?

                              SHEENI
                    Okay, it's Trent's father. So what?

                              NICK
                    So why would Trent want to help my
                    father move to Ukiah?

                              SHEENI
                    I told you, darling. Trent harbors
                    you no ill will. I will have him
                    call your father up pretending to
                    be a head hunter.

                              NICK
                    Very well, but I don't see how I am
                    to live with him. My mother values
                    my indentured servitude.

                              SHEENI
                    You must influence her to send you
                    away. I feel this will require
                    being in a constant state of open
                    revolt on your part.

                              NICK
                    What do you want me to do?

                              SHEENI
                    I propose you rent the film Rebel
                    Without a Cause as soon as
                    possible. You must emulate James
                    Dean...
          CLOSE ON her GLOSSY LIPS.

                              SHEENI
                    ...You must be bad, Nickie. Be
                    very, very bad.
          A glint of resolve in Nick's eyes.

                              NICK
                    I will, darling. I will!
          And in pre-lap comes the DING DONG of the doorbell.

          INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Joanie and Nick sit in the Chevy Nova watching Rebel Without
          a Cause through the windshield.

          

                                                                   41.

          
          Estelle enters the living room with tears streaming down her
          face and a police officer, LANCE WESCOTT, 45, with a flattop,
          watery red eyes, and assorted guns, flashlights, and billy
          clubs.

                              ESTELLE
                    Kids? This is Officer Lance
                    Wescott. He has some bad news.
          After a beat, Nick rolls down the window.

                               LANCE
                    Your mother's friend Jerry had a
                    heart attack in a bar in Dallas.
                    He's dead.
          Estelle sobs, but isn't joined by her children. She turns to
          Lance.

                              ESTELLE
                    Will they be sending his
                    belongings?

                              LANCE
                    Uh... I'm afraid they've already
                    been sent. To his wife.
          Beat. Nick looks to Joanie. They both look to their mother.

                              ESTELLE
                    His... His wife?!?
          She bursts into tears and collapses into Officer Lance
          Wescott's arms.

                              LANCE
                    There, there, Ma'am. It's going to
                    be okay.
          Nick watches his mother sobbing against the cop's chest for a
          beat before he rolls up the window and he and Joanie resume
          watching the movie.
          Estelle's cries of despair become...

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

          ....the cries of ecstasy coming through the wall along with
          the repeated exclamation of Lance's name.
          Nick rolls over in bed. Bloodshot eyes. He hauls himself out
          of bed.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I have decided to create a
                    supplementary persona named
                    FranÃ§ois.

          

                                                                     42.

          

          INT. BATHRROOM - NIGHT

          He stands in front of the mirror and leans in.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Like a Parisian James Dean, he will
                    be bold, reckless, contemptuous of
                    authority, and irresistible to
                    women.
          PUSH IN on his reflection, as a moustache appears. Then a
          beret and black and white striped shirt. Then a cigarette
          holder and Thompson machine-gun. And FRANÃOIS is born.

                              NICK
                    Hello, FranÃ§ois. I think you'll do
                    nicely.

                              FRANÃOIS

                              NICK
                    ...the itchy trigger finger...
          FranÃ§ois cocks the machine-gun.

          ...and cojone grandes!            ...and cojone grandes!

          INT. BATHRROOM - DAY

          Nick opens the door. Lance and Estelle shower behind the
          frosted glass.

                              NICK
                    Damn! Those hippos are taking a
                    shower together. How repulsive!
          He slams the door.

          INT. BASEMENT - DAY

          Nick comes down the stairs. He reaches the water heater and
          starts spinning the knob.

          INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          The forms of Estelle and Lance in the shower can be made out.
          They both start screaming as they are blasted with cold
          water. The blobs of their bodies press up against the glass.

          

                                                                     43.

          

          INT. BASEMENT - DAY

          Albert looks up at Nick and lets out a BARK. Nick smiles and
          bends down to undo his leash.

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY -DAY

          Lance bursts from the bathroom in his boxers, looking for
          blood. He hears the sound of paws climbing the stairs. Albert
          comes hurtling around he corner, almost losing his footing on
          the hardwood floor.

          ALBERT'S POV
          as we lunge at Lance's crotch.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          A BLOODCURDLING SCREAM rises up from the home.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - DAY

          Estelle hands Lance an ice-pack and he applies it to his
          injury. Nick wanders in and takes his seat at the table.

                              NICK
                    Where's Joanie?

                              ESTELLE
                    She's sleeping in.

                              NICK
                    No doubt. I don't think anyone got
                    a wink last night with all that
                    racket.
          Lance looks at him, seething inwardly. He glances to Estelle.

                              NICK
                    I thought there were laws in this
                    city against illicit cohabitation.
                    Or are they just another big
                    policeman's joke?

                              LANCE
                    Kid, you are asking for trouble.

                              NICK
                    What are you going to do? Shoot me
                    with your gun?
          Lance lunges across the table.

                              ESTELLE
                    No, Lance! Nickie, go to your room.
          Nick flings down his napkin and heads for the front door.

          

                                                                  44.

          

                              ESTELLE
                    Where do you think you're going?

                              NICK
                    Out!
          The screen door slams behind him.

          INT. GARAGE - DAY

          The garage door rattles upward, illuminating the cardboard
          box of paint supplies. Nick bends down and picks up a can of
          aerosol spray-paint. He shakes it.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY

          Nick sprays the trailer in wide sweeping motions.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - EVENING

          Joanie and Nick sun bathe in the lawn chairs. Estelle stands
          over them.

                              ESTELLE
                    What the in God's name has gotten
                    into you?!? Jerry paid good money
                    for that trailer!

                              NICK
                    And just what makes you so sure it
                    was me?

                              ESTELLE
                    Who the hell else would write such
                    a thing?
          Estelle gestures to the trailer, which we can see has been
          defaced with the words GOD'S PERFECT ASSHOLE.

                              ESTELLE
                    And just how do you explain this?
          She holds up a semi-nude Polaroid of Lacey.

                              NICK
                    That's Lacey.

                              ESTELLE
                    And just who the hell is Lacey?

                              NICK
                    Dad's girlfriend.
          Estelle stares at the photo, face contorted by revulsion and
          envy.

          

                                                                  45.

          

                              ESTELLE
                    His girlfriend? What are you doing
                    with a picture like this of your
                    father's girlfriend?

                              JOANIE
                    C'mon, Mom, all boys his age have
                    pictures like that to...

                              ESTELLE
                    When I want your opinion on raising
                    my child, I'll ask for it.
                        (to Nick; morbidly

                         CURIOUS)
                    And what's this Lacey tart like?

                              NICK
                    Well, she likes fast cars and takes
                    a lot of naps with dad.
          Super:             (True)

                              NICK
                    She likes to sit on Dad's lap while
                    he eats and blow in his ear.
          Super:           (Not true)

                              NICK
                    And she calls him "Thunder Rod" and
                    he calls her "Sugar Puss."
          Super:       (True; believe it or not)
          At this point Estelle has turned bright red.

                              ESTELLE
                    You are confined to your room until
                    school starts, you sick pervert.
          She stalks off. Joanie glances over at Nick with amusement.

                              NICK
                    I wish I was leaving with you
                    tonight.

                              JOANIE
                    Your day will come. I never thought
                    mine would, but it did. Was all
                    that stuff about Lacey and Dad made
                    up?

                              NICK
                    I wish. Did you really take a
                    posture class?

          

                                                                     46.

          

                              JOANIE
                    Implants. I wanted them all my
                    life.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY

          A knock on the door. Lefty enters the room and Nick pulls the
          headphones off his ears.

                              NICK
                    Hey, Lefty.

                              LEFTY
                    What's with your mom, Nick? She
                    gave me the third degree just to
                    come up here.

                              NICK
                    I vandalized Jerry's trailer and
                    she found my picture of Lacey.

                              LEFTY
                    Well, good thing I stole this from
                    the bookstore then.
          Lefty unzips his backpack and produces a large hardbound
          volume titled Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets.

                              LEFTY
                    I was reading it all last night.
                    Boy, having sex is a lot more
                    complicated than I thought. Did you
                    know you were supposed to stick
                    your pinkie in her bumhole?

                               NICK
                    You lie.

                              LEFTY
                    No way, man. Here, I got the page
                    marked.
          Lefty flops down on the sofa next to Nick and the two of them
          flip through the manual.

                              NICK
                    Yeah, but I'm not sure I should try
                    this on Sheeni. I think this book
                    is for people who've been married
                    so long they're disgusted by the
                    sight of each other.
          They regard the illustrated figures of men and women in
          various states of foreplay.

          

                                                                  47.

          

                              LEFTY
                    Are we really supposed to be
                    that... uh... big?

                              NICK
                    I think these illustrations are
                    disproportionate for emphasis.

                              LEFTY
                    Maybe we should compare.

                              NICK
                    Perhaps we should. Just for the
                    sake of research.
          Nick and Lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each
          other like a pair of duelists. They simultaneously undo their
          belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet.
          They straighten. Lefty's eyes fall to Nick's crotch. He gets
          a hint of concern in his expression.
          Nick stares at Lefty's, tilting his head to compensate for
          the curvature.
          The door behind them opens and Estelle appears toting Nick's
          lunch. She lets out a scream. The boys turn to face her,
          pants around their ankles.

                                ESTELLE

                    PERVERTS!
          She hurls the tray of food at them. Lefty bolts. Nick hastily
          tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him around
          the room, grabbing up objects and hurling them his way.

                              ESTELLE

                    FRIGGIN' GODDAMN PERVERTS!

          INT. ESTELLE'S HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

          Lefty emerges from the room and takes off.

                              ESTELLE
                    You won't get away! I'm calling
                    your parents! PERVERTS!
          Nick bursts from the room, desperately trying to buckle his
          pants. Estelle is hot on his heels, wielding the hardbound
          sex manual as they round the bannister.

                              ESTELLE
                    In my house! How dare you!
          She catches up to Nick at the top of the stairs and cracks
          him upside the head.

          

                                                                    48.

          
          He loses his balance and goes tumbling down the staircase,
          letting out a moan that stutters as his head hits each step.
          He comes crashing into the foyer, landing on the slate.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - EVENING

          Nick watches out the window.
          Estelle can be seen animatedly describing the events to
          LEFTY'S PARENTS. Lefty glances up at Nick and gives a pained
          expression.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - LATER

          Nick lays on his belly reading No Exit. He looks up when he
          hears the sound of footsteps in the hall. Shadows appear
          beneath the crack in the door.
          Estelle opens the door and looks down at him.

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, I just want you to know that
                    I've thought about it, and I've
                    accepted that you are gay.

                              NICK
                    Thanks a pantsful, but I'm not gay.
                    If you're really concerned though,
                    I suggest you get me a room at the
                    Ukiah Motel 6. If anyone can
                    straighten me out, it's Sheeni.
          She looks at him dubiously and hands out the phone.

                              ESTELLE
                    That sounds more like a job for
                    your father. Here, he wants to talk
                    to you.
          Nick takes the phone from her hands and she closes the door.

                              NICK
                        (into phone)
                    Hello?

          INT. GEORGE TWISP'S HOME - NIGHT


                               GEORGE
                    So what's this I hear about you
                    being gay?
          George sprawls on the couch, cradling the phone with one
          hand, and holding a beer on his stomach with the other. WE

          INTERCUT.

          

                                                                  49.

          

                              NICK
                    What's this I hear about you being
                    unemployed?

                              GEORGE
                    Yes, but my condition is only
                    temporary. I can change it.

                              NICK
                    I hope you do. We need the money.

                              GEORGE
                    Nick, there are more important
                    things in life than money.

                              NICK
                    I know, Dad. Like getting a good
                    education. And being able to
                    respect your parents.

                              GEORGE
                    I've got two words for you. Safe
                    sex.

                              NICK
                    Thanks, Dad.
          He hangs up the phone.

          EXT. OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOL - DAY

          Intimidating PUNK MUSIC. School bus doors fold open and Nick
          steps off. The MUSIC pounds from the boom box resting on the
          hood of the Mustang GT where a pack of SKINHEADS follow Nick
          with their eyes.
          Nick walks past them, glancing over at the assembly of ASIAN
          GANGSTERS glaring at him from their perch on the wall.

          INT. OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          Nick pushes past a fight where two kids throw each other
          against the lockers. He smiles at a pair of PUNK ROCK GIRLS.
          One of them flips him off. Nick heads into...

          INT. BOYS ROOM - DAY

          And as Nick steps into the bathroom, we follow his eyes...
          SWISH TO... a CRIP selling a bag of dope to a GOTH FRESHMAN.
          SWISH TO... a LATIN KING vandalizing the wall with the words

          LATIN KINGS WERE HERE.
          SWISH TO... a pack of WIGGERS as one of them gives the others
          a butterfly knife show-and-tell.

                              NICK
                    Hello, uh... My name is Nick. Nick
                    Twisp. My father's name is George
                    Twisp.

                              NICK
                    Not lately. But he's missed several
                    child support payments, and is not
                    looking for work. So now I'm going
                    to public school in Oakland.

                    Yes. And he's had an offer from a
                    respectable publication in Ukiah.

          EXT. OAKLAND - DAY

          Nick walks Albert down the sidewalk. Lefty crosses the street
          to him and they walk together.

                              NICK
                    Hey, Lefty. How's it hangin'?

                              LEFTY
                    You'll never believe who called me,
                    Nick. Millie Filbert!

                              NICK
                    What?!? Why?

                              LEFTY
                    I dunno. She just called and asked
                    if I wanted to hang out tonight. I
                    didn't want to ask why. I need to
                    find someplace for us to get it on.
          Albert squats to poop in someone's yard. The boys pause to
          wait for him.

          

                                                                  51.

                                LEFTY
                    Really?

                              NICK
                    Sure. My Mom and Lance are going to
                    a movie and I'm planning on
                    stealing Jerry's trailer and
                    torching it in a parking lot, so
                    you'll have the whole house to
                    yourself.

                                LEFTY
                    Right on.
          Albert finishes his business and they resume walking.

                              NICK
                    So where you headed anyway?

                              LEFTY
                    Dr. Browerly's office. My parents
                    are making me see a shrink now.

                              NICK
                    He asking lots of weird questions?

                              LEFTY
                    You bet your left nut he is! He
                    asked if I had any lustful thoughts
                    toward my sister.

                              NICK
                    What did you tell him?

                              LEFTY
                    I told him about beating off once
                    with her brassiere.

                              NICK
                    What did you tell him that for?

                              LEFTY
                    You don't know what it's like. I
                    think they release chemicals in
                    their office to make you tell the
                    truth.

                              NICK
                    Sounds like a professional. He must
                    be very expensive.

                              LEFTY
                    I wouldn't know. The bill goes to
                    your house.

                    I guess so. It was your cyclops I
                    was staring at.

                              NICK
                    Yes, but it was your idea.

                              LEFTY
                    That's true. Gee, maybe I am gay.

                              NICK
                    Don't be retarded. We were doing
                    research for our girlfriends.

                              LEFTY
                    Oh, right. I forgot. That's a
                    relief. So you'll leave the door
                    open?

                               NICK
                    Yeah, just don't blow your load on
                    my sheets.

                              LEFTY
                    Thanks a pantsful, Nick.

                              NICK
                    Don't mention it. See ya, Lefty.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - DAY

          Nick hunches over his desk doing homework, headphones over
          his ears. Estelle knocks and enters. Nick pulls the
          headphones down around his neck.

                              ESTELLE
                    Lance and I are walking down to the
                    movie theater. There's TV dinners
                    in the freezer. Oh, and Nick - your
                    father got a job in Ukiah.

                              NICK
                    Mom? Do you think it might be a
                    good idea if I moved in with him?

                              ESTELLE
                    Nick, that just wouldn't work. I
                    depend on that child support money
                    to eat.

                              NICK
                    But shouldn't you depend on the
                    child support money for, you
                    know... child support?

                              ESTELLE
                    Watch your smart mouth.
          She slams the door.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    The plan is simple.
          Nick places two full cannisters of gasoline into the trunk of
          the Lincoln.
          Nick's behind the wheel, backing up the car.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Tow Jerry's trailer to a remote
                    parking lot in Berkeley and burn it
                    to the ground.
          The hitch ball grinds under the trailer socket.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Thus evicting myself from my
                    mother's clutches and into the arms
                    of My One And Only Love.
          Nick fires up the V-8 engine and shifts into drive, pulling
          forward. He cuts across the lawn.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    FranÃ§ois wanted to torch the
                    trailer where it sits, but I've
                    convinced him a parking lot will
                    reduce the risk of collateral
                    damage.
          The trailer clips the corner of the house. Chunks of stucco
          fall and the galvanized downspout shudders and writhes,
          collapsing the long rain gutter running across the front of
          the home.
          Nick guns it, and with a lurch the trailer splinters free. He
          dodges the birch tree, but plows over the smaller Asian pear.
          The Lincoln bounces the curb and catapults into the street,
          the trailer weaving back and forth, smashing parked cars.

          INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

          Nick cruises along sedately. He plays with the radio and
          settles on the Sex Pistols.
          He looks up just in time to see the red light and slams on
          the brakes, nearly jack-knifing the trailer.
          The light turns green and the car lumbers up the long hill.

          

                                                                  54.

          

          EXT. BERKELEY - DAY

          Nick hits the bump in the road right before the stop sign.
          The car bottoms out. The trailer bounces up, coming
          unhitched.

          I/E. LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY
          Nick hits the gas and the Lincoln suddenly surges forward,
          released from the great weight.
          Nick smiles. Behind him, through the rear window, the trailer
          can be seen receding into the distance. He glances into the
          mirror and spots the trailer plunging down the hill.
          Then he crashes into the Fiat parked in front of him at the
          intersection. The gas tank on the Fiat cracks, spurting fuel
          onto the pavement.

          EXT. BERKELEY - DAY

          Nick leaps from the Lincoln and watches open-mouthed as the
          vehicular ballet unfolds.
          Down the hill - the speeding trailer sideswipes a delivery
          van and goes into a spin. The BOHEMIANS sipping espresso at
          the outdoor cafÃ© look up to see the words GOD'S PERFECT
          ASSHOLE bearing down on them.
          The delivery van veers out of control. The Bohemians scatter.
          The truck runs over a fire hydrant and smashes its way
          through the patio furniture and into the cafÃ©.
          A geyser of water plumes where the hydrant once stood.
          The trailer resumes its downward plunge toward the busy cross
          street below.
          KWOMP! Nick turns to see the still-restive Lincoln part from
          the Fiat and begin to roll down the hill after its partner.

                              NICK
                    Oh no! I forgot to set the brake!
          The DRIVER OF THE FIAT bolts after the accelerating Lincoln,
          but as he realizes the futility, slows to a jog.
          The driver turns to see he forgot to set his own brake, and
          desperately rolls out of the way of the Fiat.
          MOTORISTS slam on their brakes as the speeding trailer
          crosses four lanes of traffic. It jumps the curb crashing
          into the plate glass window of a gourmet sausage shop.
          A cop car lights up and speeds into the intersection, just in
          time to get clipped by the Lincoln.
          The cop car goes into a tail spin, smashing into a chicken
          transport. The flock of feathered inmates fly for freedom.

          

                                                                  55.

          

          
          The Lincoln continues to generate momentum on its slalom run,
          thundering past the stopped cars and into the wrecked
          building like a runaway express train.
          The gas cannisters in the trunk ignite and the sausage shop
          explodes, the trailer's two propane tanks going off like
          bombs.
          The Fiat comes flying into the flaming mess and blasts apart,
          sending shards of metal and sausage links to go raining down
          on the spectators.
          The blaze lights the trail of gasoline left by the broken
          fuel tank and a stream of liquid fire races up the hill,
          ending at Nick's feet.
          Nick takes a moment to watch in horror as dark plumes of
          smoke billow into the sky, the geyser of water, the storm of
          dazed chickens. He turns around and does his best to
          inconspicuously walk OUT OF FRAME.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          WE FOLLOW Nick as he comes through the front door and is met
          with the sight of his mother and Lance staring at him from
          the kitchen table.
          The Berkeley fire rages on the television.

                              LANCE
                    I'll think of something, Estelle.
          He gives her ass a playful squeeze. She lets out a giggle.

                              LANCE
                    Now the kid better not be here when
                    the detectives start coming around.
                    I'd send him away for a while. A
                    long while.

                               ESTELLE
                    He can go make his father's life
                    miserable!
          Nick suddenly brightens.

                              NICK
                    But I like it here.

                              ESTELLE
                    You're going, buster!
          She snatches up the phone and dials. George's groggy voice
          can be heard answering. Estelle screams into the phone.

          

                                                                  57.

                              LANCE
                    Wait a minute, Estelle, aren't you
                    going to punish him? I'd say he
                    deserves a good hiding.

                              ESTELLE
                        (cupping the squawking

                         PHONE)
                    He's too much for me anymore. Can
                    you do it, Lance, darling?
          Lance gives Nick another smirk.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick let's out a yelp of pain as Lance brings a broken tree
          limb against his bare bottom. WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I don't scream much. I am making a
                    painful sacrifice for The Woman Of
                    My Dreams. My suffering possesses a
                    beauty which elevates it above this
                    sordid scene.
          With the final blow the tree limb cracks in half. Nick looks
          over his shoulder.

                              NICK
                    Are you through?
          Lance looks around the room. Picks up an umbrella and
          considers it in his hand. Nick hangs his head.

          EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - NIGHT

          We find Nick waiting in the drive with a pile of suitcases
          beside him.

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    Psst. Nick.
          Nick finds Lefty lurking in the shrubs that divide his
          mother's lawn from the neighbor's. He limps to his friend.

                              NICK
                    I was wondering what happened to
                    you. Did you get to blow your wad?

                              LEFTY
                    No. I did not get to blow my wad.

          

                                                                  58.

          

                              NICK
                    Did you get interrupted?

                                 LEFTY
                    No. Worse.

                              NICK
                    What's worse than being
                    interrupted?

                              LEFTY
                    Millie is a lesbian.

                                 NICK

                    WHAT?!?

                              LEFTY
                    The only reason she wanted to hang
                    out with me is because she heard
                    that I showed you my slinky and
                    thought I was gay too.

                              NICK
                    Sorry, man. I didn't have a great
                    night either.

                              LEFTY
                    Well, I dunno what you're gonna do,
                    but I'm giving suicide serious
                    consideration this time.

                              NICK
                    Or you could just fake it and then
                    hide out in Ukiah with me. Then
                    later come back and maybe Millie
                    Filbert will boink you out of pity.

                              LEFTY
                    Hey, that's not a bad idea. Thanks
                    a pantsful, Nick.
          A pair of headlights swing into the drive and Lefty ducks out
          of sight. The headlights turn out to belong to George Twisp's

          BMW.
          The driver's side window rolls down to reveal Nick's dad.
          Lacey leans over George's seat to wave at Nick through the
          window and show him some of her cleavage.

                              LACEY
                    Hiya, Nick!

                              NICK
                    Hi, Lacey. Hi, Dad.
          The trunk pops open.

          

                                                                    59.

          

                              NICK
                    Is there any way I could sit up
                    front with Lacey, Dad? Mom's
                    boyfriend beat me pretty badly.

                              GEORGE
                    Sorry, Nick. In this car, faggots
                    get the back seat.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT
          Nick is in the back, crowded in by his belongings and Albert.
          They ride in tense silence until they pass the sight of the
          fire, where FIRE FIGHTERS sift through the ash.

                              GEORGE
                    My God. Look what you've done.
          Lacey turns to look at Nick over the seat. They share a
          smile.

          EXT. UKIAH - ESTABLISHING - DAY

          Morning peers over the distant hills.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          The BMW pulls into the drive of the house - a plywood
          rectangle perched on cement blocks. Aluminum windows. A swamp
          cooler on the shallow-pitched roof. They all emerge from the
          car.

                              GEORGE
                    Go ahead and bring your stuff
                    inside. Lacey and I need a nap.
                    C'mon, Sugar Puss.
          Nick watches longingly as George leads Lacey into the home.
          As he places his hand on Lacey's ass, he looks back over his
          shoulder and throws a smug look in Nick's direction.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    What a competitive asshole.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          Nick reaches the door and gently knocks. But it's Sheeni's
          ogre of a father who answers the door and stares at Nick
          sternly.

                              NICK
                    Uhm, hello. Is Sheeni available?

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    She most certainly is not. As a
                    matter of fact, we've banned you
                    from her life, Nick Twisp.

          

                                                                   60.

          

                                 NICK
                    Excuse me?

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    Trent Preston informed us that not
                    only were you moving here to pursue
                    my daughter, but that you're not
                    even mentally-handicapped, and thus
                    molested my wife in the shower of
                    sound mind and body.

                              NICK
                    That rat-fink-fuck!

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    You watch your language. This is a
                    Christian home. We're sending
                    Sheeni to Les Ãcole des Arts and
                    Literatures in Santa Cruz.

                              NICK
                    Santa Cruz! But she'll be miserable
                    without me. We're in love.
          The ogre snorts in condescending amusement.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    Then I guess it's a good thing
                    Trent is going there too. She'll
                    have someone to console her.
          And with that, Mr. Saunders slams the door so hard in Nick's
          face that the entire two story mobile home rocks back and
          forth.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          Nick makes his way past the arbor, crestfallen. Sheeni
          emerges from the shadows in a hooded sweatshirt over a
          lavender dress.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick! Oh, Nick!
          Nick lights up at the sight of her and they embrace. They
          kiss passionately. He works his way to her neck and starts to
          reach under the sweatshirt.

                              SHEENI
                    I had to sneak away just to see
                    you.

                              NICK
                    That's okay. I had to burn down
                    half of Berkley.

          

                                                                     61.

          

                               SHEENI
                    That was you? Nick, are you out of
                    your mind?

                              NICK
                    I felt a grand gesture was
                    required, darling.
          Sheeni's expression indicates that she is touched, but it
          turns to troubled.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick, Trent betrayed us.

                              NICK
                    FranÃ§ois will kill him later.

                              SHEENI
                    Who's FranÃ§ois?

                              NICK
                    Nevermind. The point is we must
                    elope.
          Sheeni takes a step back at the notion.

                              SHEENI
                    I don't know, Nick. I do love you,
                    but I don't want to spend the rest
                    of our lives on the run.

                              NICK
                    It's a small price to pay.
          She takes another step back.

                              SHEENI
                    I... I can't, Nick.

                              NICK
                    What?!? But, Sheeni. I just don't
                    get it. I'm here. Albert's here
                    too.

                              SHEENI
                    I know, Nick, and I've been longing
                    for you so. But we'll just have to
                    find another way. The car is
                    already packed.
          Nick nods glumly and Sheeni seems overcome with remorse.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick Twisp, I will not allow you to
                    accept defeat so easily!

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                  62.

          
                              SHEENI (cont'd)
                    When the time is right, you must
                    make your way to Santa Cruz. And
                    then we will make love.
          Nick lifts his gaze with renewed determination.

                              NICK
                    Or we could consummate here in the
                    woods.

                              SHEENI
                    Did you bring the consumer reports?
          Nick just blinks blankly.

                              SHEENI
                    Then it will have to be Santa Cruz.
                    I really must go now, darling.

                              NICK
                    Well... Goodbye, Sheeni. I love
                    you.

                              SHEENI
                    I love you too. Squeeze darling
                    Albert for me.
          She pulls her hood over her head. Nick watches wistfully as
          she slips away into the forest.

                               NICK (V.O.)
                    I have endured a five million
                    dollar beating for nothing.

                        (BEAT)
                    I have been stabbed. Stabbed in the
                    back.

          INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

          Two WRESTLERS slam down onto the mat below us.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I do not have a friend within a
                    hundred miles. This is a daunting
                    thought if you think about it.
          WE TRACK down the row of other students, starting with a
          THREE HUNDRED POUND BEHEMOTH. The row seems to descend in
          weight class, until we reach Nick at the very end.

                                                   CUT TO:
          Nick does his best to not be pinned by DWAYNE CRAMPTON, who
          out-weighs him by at least 40 pounds.

          

                                                                  63.

          

          INT. BOYS SHOWER ROOM - DAY

          Nick rinses off. Dwayne steps up to the shower head next to
          his. Nick glances his way and quickly recoils at the
          repelling landscape of rolling pink flab.

                              DWAYNE
                    Sorry `bout wompin' ya. I'm Dwayne.

                              NICK
                    Nick. Nick Twisp.

                              DWAYNE
                    Say, Nick? Why do you suppose guys
                    got only two testicles when we got
                    ten fingers and toes?

                              NICK
                    I could not begin to speculate.
          Nick turns off his shower and slinks away.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          Nick comes up the dusty road toting his backpack.
          On the porch of the Saunders' home, a handsome but somewhat
          unkempt PAUL SAUNDERS, mid-twenties, blows cool jazz on a
          beat-up trumpet.

                              PAUL
                    Hey, Nick. I'm Paul, Sheeni's
                    brother.
          Nick comes up the path to meet him.

                              NICK
                    Hello, Paul. How did you know my
                    name?

                                 PAUL
                    We've met.

                              NICK
                    No we haven't.

                              PAUL
                    In a previous life.

                                 NICK
                    Oh.
          Paul begins rolling a joint.

                              PAUL
                    Nice fire in Berkeley.

          

                                                                    64.

          

                              NICK
                    Did Sheeni tell you that was me?

                              PAUL
                    She didn't have to.

                              NICK
                    Why? Was I an arsonist in a
                    previous life?

                              PAUL
                    No. But Sheeni was.

                              NICK
                    My God. What did she burn?

                              PAUL
                    Men. Men and boys.
          Paul hands the joint out to Nick. He regards it dubiously.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          An empty hallway. PSYCHEDELIC SOUND plays.
          Nick comes around the corner, literally floating down the
          hall. He breaststrokes through the air toward us.

          INT. GEORGE AND LACEY'S ROOM - DAY

          He passes just under the door frame and comes down, feet
          touching carpet. He looks into the mirror and finds FranÃ§ois
          lounging on the bed behind him.

                              NICK
                    My God, FranÃ§ois! What was Paul
                    smoking?

                              FRANCOIS
                    Shut up and go with it.
          Nick shrugs and opens the top dresser drawer, revealing
          Lacey's lingerie.
          Nick starts dancing, doing a strip tease for himself. WE PAN
          AROUND the room, and when we reach Nick again, he's wearing
          nothing but a pair of Lacey's thongs.
          He models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging T.E.
          He removes a C-cup bra and holds it high. He uses the elastic
          straps to fasten the bra onto his head.
          He starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy Vengaboys
          rendition of BRAZIL in his head. Waving arms. Bicycling leg
          movements.

          

                                                                  65.

          
          As he backs up we can see that George is watching him from
          the doorway, a Safeway bag in his arms. Lacey peers over his
          shoulder. The MUSIC halts abruptly.

                              GEORGE
                    What the... What the hell?
          Nick gives a startled jump.

                              LACEY
                    Is..? Is that my bra?

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - NIGHT

          Nick sits at the table, considerably more clothed and sober.
          George works on a jug of zin.

                              GEORGE
                    We're calling that fruitcake
                    display strike one. Two more
                    strikes and it's back to Oakland.
          Nick nods. The front door opens and MRS. CRAMPTON enters with
          Safeway bags of her own. Dwayne follows close behind her.

                                 DWAYNE
                    Hey, Nick!
          Albert barks and jumps at Dwayne's feet.

                              NICK
                    Uh... Hi, Dwayne. What are you
                    doing here?

                              DWAYNE
                    Ain't ya heard. We're gonna be
                    roommates! Ain't that zinky?
          Nick looks to his father in horror as Dwayne goes chasing
          after the dog.

                              MRS. CRAMPTON
                    Dwayne, get yer dumb ass back here
                    and take yer sleepin' pill. You
                    must be Nick. Wash yer hands, boy.
                    I don't serve two shifts.

                              NICK
                    Uh... Dad? What's going on?

                              GEORGE
                    Mrs. Crampton's our new
                    housekeeper. I'm renting out the
                    spare room to her seeing as her
                    camper has been deemed unfit for
                    human habitation.

          

                                                                     66.

          

                              NICK
                    What about Dwayne?

                              GEORGE
                    He's bunking with you.

                              NICK
                    Dad!

                              GEORGE
                    You working on strike two?
          Nick leans back and glares in silent protest as everyone
          takes their seats at the table.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick tries to shut out the sound of Dwayne getting into the
          creaky bed behind him.

                              DWAYNE
                    Say, Nick. You wanna sleep in bed
                    with me? It'll be tons warmer.

                              NICK
                    No thank you, Dwayne.
          A knock at the door. Lacey enters.

                              LACEY
                    This came for you, Nick.
          Nick sits up in bed to receive the letter. As Lacey leaves,
          he tears through the wax seal and unfolds its contents.

                              DWAYNE
                    Is it a love letter, Nick?

                              NICK
                    I don't know, it's in French. Say,
                    why does your mother give you
                    sleeping pills?

                              DWAYNE
                    `Cuz otherwise I'd stay up all
                    night playin' Nintendo Wii. Say,
                    Nick, can I walk Albert?

                              NICK
                    I don't know. Dogs don't grow on
                    trees.

                              DWAYNE
                    Pleeease, Nick?

          

                                                                  67.

          

                              NICK
                    Okay. But it will cost you one
                    sleeping pill per walk.

                              DWAYNE
                    Whatchu want them pills for, Nick?

                              NICK
                    You never know when sedatives will
                    come in handy.

          EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          Nick emerges from the home. He makes his way down the road.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          He stops at the familiar sight of My Green Haven. He gets an
          amused smile and sighs with nostalgia.
          The front door of the trailer opens and Lefty emerges. Nick
          furrows his brow in confusion as Lefty locks the door and
          comes down the path.

                              NICK
                    Lefty?

                              LEFTY
                    Oh. Hey, Nick!

                              NICK
                    Lefty, what are you doing here?

                              LEFTY
                    I live here. The guy's only
                    charging me fifty in cash a month.

                              NICK
                    I mean, what are you doing in town?

                              LEFTY
                    I did what you told me, Nick. I
                    threw my backpack off the pier and
                    reported my own suicide. I even
                    left a note.

                              NICK
                    Wow, Lefty, I'm kinda impressed.
                    Faking your suicide is pretty
                    ballsy.
          Lefty joins Nick in his walk down the road.

                              LEFTY
                    So where you headed?

          

                                                                  68.

          

                              NICK
                    Redwood High School.

                              LEFTY
                    Can I come?

                              NICK
                    Why would you want to go to school
                    if you didn't have to?

                              LEFTY
                    It's weird, Nick, but school seems
                    like a pretty fun place to hang out
                    once you get rid of classes and
                    homework.

                              NICK
                    I can see this stunt really has
                    liberated your mind.

                              LEFTY
                    I'm telling you, Nick: killing
                    myself was the best thing that ever
                    happened to me.

          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

          A rowdy cafeteria. Lefty and Nick dine in the corner. Nick
          has an open French textbook as he tries to decipher Sheeni's
          letter. An Indian boy, VIJAY JOSHI, 16, makes his way to
          them.

                              VIJAY
                    May I sit at your table?

                              LEFTY
                    Sure. I'm Lefty and this is Nick.

                              VIJAY
                    I am Vijay Joshi.
          Vijay sits and shakes their hands.

                              VIJAY
                    I see you both have been rejected
                    by the socially elite of our
                    school. Ukiah is a cultural
                    wasteland compared to India. Though
                    some of the girls are very
                    attractive.

                              NICK
                    Do you have a girlfriend?

                              VIJAY
                    Not at the moment. But I am
                    optimistic. How about you?

          

                                                                     69.

          

                              NICK
                    Yes, but she transferred.

                              VIJAY
                    You don't mean Sheeni Saunders. I
                    heard she was interested in some
                    brilliant fellow in the Bay Area.

                              LEFTY
                    Hey, that's you, Nick.

                              VIJAY
                    I'm surprised. You are not at all
                    what I imagined.
          Nick narrows his eyes.

                              VIJAY
                    So how is Sheeni?

                              NICK
                    I don't know. She sent me this
                    letter. But it's in French.

                              VIJAY
                    Shall I translate it for you?

                              NICK
                    You speak French?

                              VIJAY
                    I speak French, English, Hindi,
                    Marathi, and Urdu.

                              LEFTY
                    That must come in handy.
          Nick hands over the letter and Vijay starts reading it
          silently. He chuckles as he reads and Nick squints his eyes
          at him in annoyance.
          Vijay picks up on it, clears his throat and reads aloud.

                              VIJAY
                    Dear, Nick...

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - SUNSET

          In Nick's imagination, Sheeni puts pen to paper at her desk
          which affords a view of the sun setting on the ocean.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    ...I am writing you from my room in
                    Santa Cruz. Surprisingly, boarding
                    school has proven to be a welcome
                    liberation as well as...

          

                                                                     70.

          

          INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT


                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    ...a stimulating experience which I
                    am now not so quick to change.
          Sheeni slips into a nightgown as other GIRLS walk around
          scantily clad behind her.

                              SHEENI
                    Perhaps you should consider
                    learning French and enrolling. That
                    said...

          INT. ÃCOLE DES ARTS ET LITTÃRATURE - HALLWAY - DAY

          Sheeni chats up a gathering of HANDSOME BOYS in the hall.
          They regard her lustfully.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    ...English cannot be spoken on
                    campus even if you are hemorrhaging
                    from an accidental limb amputation.

          INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY


                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    I have made friends with the head
                    of the girls' basketball team. Her
                    name is Heather, and despite her
                    popularity, she is saving herself
                    for college boys.
          HEATHER, a slender giantess, poses with the other members of
          the BASKETBALL TEAM for a yearbook photo.

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT


                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    I have an interesting roommate from
                    New York named Taggarty...
          TAGGARTY, short dark hair, intense green eyes, Manhattan
          sophistication cloaked in fragile ripeness, snaps a Polaroid
          of a sleepy BOY.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    She has already slept with
                    seventeen boys and hopes to rack up
                    fifty before leaving here.
          Taggarty tacks the picture to a wall covered with Polaroids.
          She writes the boy's grade (C-) beneath his image.

          EXT. BEACH - DAY

          The distant figure on the windsurf board can only be Trent.

          

                                                                     71.

          

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    Trent has taken up windsurfing and
                    has been designated target number
                    one by all the girls. I am still
                    very angry at him for the betrayal
                    but he claims he wants to mend our
                    friendship.
          The figure falls into the surf and the crowd of watching
          BIKINI-CLAD GIRLS gasp in horror.

                              SHEENI (V.O.)
                    I guess we shall see.

          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY


                              VIJAY

                        (READING)
                    All in all, I'm happy and look
                    forward to further growth in this
                    rich, intellectual environment.
          Vijay sets down the letter. Nick waits a beat, staring in
          disbelief.

                              NICK
                    That's it? Nothing else about me?
          Vijay picks up the letter again.

                              VIJAY
                    Oh yes... Love to you and Albert.
                        (setting down the letter)
                    Who's Albert?

                              NICK
                    Albert is our dog. This is a
                    disaster. What the hell does she
                    mean Trent wants to mend the
                    relationship?

                               VIJAY
                    I don't know, but this Taggarty
                    girl sounds very uninhibited. I
                    wonder if she's made it with a
                    Hindu yet.

                              LEFTY
                    Heather sounds like a babe. You
                    think if I grew a beard I'd pass
                    for college age?

                              NICK
                    I've got to get to Sheeni as soon
                    as possible. If I don't Trent
                    Preston is going to mindfuck her
                    into thinking she doesn't like me.

          

                                                                  72.

          

                              LEFTY
                    And then he'll probably fuck her in
                    other ways. Did you know you're
                    supposed to put your pinkie in a
                    girl's bumhole, Vijay?

                              NICK
                    Will you shut up and help me out?

                              LEFTY
                    Sorry, Nick. What should we do?

                              NICK
                    I suggest we steal my father's BMW
                    and take a trip to Santa Cruz.
                    Vijay, you'll have to be our
                    translator.

                              VIJAY
                    But what will we tell our parents?

                              LEFTY
                    You can tell your father you are
                    staying at Nick's house for the
                    weekend. And visa versa.

                              NICK
                    Good thinking.

                              VIJAY
                    But what if we are caught?

                              NICK
                    To hell with it, Vijay. It's time
                    to take action!
          THREE CUTS. The JINGLE as Nick removes his Dad's keys from
          the bureau. The trunk SLAMMING closed with the sleeping bags
          inside. The ROAR of the engine as Vijay's hand turns the key
          in the ignition.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
          As Vijay drives, Lefty holds up a road map in the back seat.
          Nick places a CD in the stereo and TAKE FIVE fills the car.

                              LEFTY
                    What is this music, Nick?

                              NICK
                    It's Dave Brubeck.
                        (to Vijay)
                    I thought a person as cultured as
                    yourself would appreciate it.

          

                                                                     73.

          

                              VIJAY
                    You want culture? I will give you
                    culture.
          Vijay puts in his own CD and Ravi Shankar's TARANA blasts
          from the speakers.
          Nick gives Vijay a grin of approval. MUSIC PLAYS OVER...

          EXT. REDWOOD FORESTS - DAY

          WE FLY through the forest to keep up with the Beamer.

          EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

          The BMW passes cars on the Golden Gate Bridge.

          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

          The Beamer navigates the winding curves of the highway where
          green hills meet the Pacific Ocean.

          EXT. ÃCOLE DES ARTS ET LITTÃRATURE - DUSK

          The car pulls to a stop in the parking lot, the school
          looming beyond, slightly obfuscated by a light drizzle. The
          music cuts out with the engine.

          EXT. ÃCOLE DES ARTS ET LITTÃRATURE - GROUNDS - DUSK

          The grouping of BOYS part as we move through them. Finally,
          we reach the center of their attention...
          Sheeni, Taggarty, and Heather standing together in their
          coats.

                              SHEENI
                    Nickie?
          Nick, Vijay, and Lefty are noticeably shorter than the older
          boys around them.

                              NICK
                    Hello, Sheeni.
                        (to Taggarty and Heather)
                    Hi, I'm Nick.

                              TAGGARTY
                    Oh. So you're Nick.

                              HEATHER
                    We've heard so much about you.

                              NICK
                    And this is Vijay. And this is
                    Lefty. Lefty goes to USC.

          

                                                                  74.

          

                              LEFTY
                    And I'm not gay.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick, I knew you'd come!
          Sheeni glances over at the disapproving MATRON. She leans in
          close.

                              SHEENI
                    ...but you must wait in the car
                    until we can sneak you in.
          Nick nods in understanding.

          INT. GIRLS' DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          An empty hall. The SNEAKY STRINGS of NIGHT ON BALD MOUNTAIN.
          Sheeni rounds the corner at the far end. As she and Heather
          sneak the boys down, the other OCCUPANTS of the floor giggle
          in French and dart from door to door in near-undress.

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          A cement cubicle just big enough for a bunk bed, two small
          desks, an army surplus dresser, and a stuffed armchair.
          Sheeni pulls a nightgown from the dresser.

                              HEATHER
                    Lefty, should maybe sleep in my
                    room. It's pretty crowded in here.

                              LEFTY
                    Your roommate won't mind?

                              HEATHER
                    Oh, Darlene went home for the
                    weekend.
          Lefty gulps and picks up his grip. He pauses in the hallway.

                              LEFTY
                    Well, see you guys in the morning.
          The door closes and Vijay and Nick exchange a knowing glance.

                              SHEENI
                    Pardon me, everyone.
          Sheeni steps into the tiny closet to change. Vijay and Nick
          regard the...

          WALL OF TAGGARTY'S CONQUESTS
          a series of mug shots of sullen-looking TEENAGE BOYS. Most of
          them have been given a grade of C- or below.

          

                                                                    75.

          

                              NICK
                    There's your competition.

                              VIJAY
                    A distinguished group I would be
                    happy to join.
          The two boys turn around and watch in hot-blooded bliss as
          Taggarty searches for her misplaced nightie.

          INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          The two boys brush their pearlies over the grungy sink.

                              VIJAY
                    I am in a state of sexual frenzy.
                    What is your plan?

                              NICK
                    We drape a blanket over the lower
                    bunk for Sheeni and me. You tackle
                    Taggarty on the top bunk. Here's a
                    condom. I slipped two to Lefty,
                    leaving us with four.

                              VIJAY
                    What if they don't go for it?

                              NICK
                    They'll go for it. You can cut the
                    sexual tension in that room with a
                    knife.

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT


                              SHEENI
                    Don't be silly, darling. Not with
                    others in the room.
                        (leaning in to whisper)
                    We must wait until everyone falls
                    asleep.
          Nick tries to appear unconcerned. She gives him a kiss and
          climbs into her narrow bed.
          As Nick and Vijay prepare their sleeping bags on the floor,
          they watch Taggarty climb up to her bunk in the sky.

                              TAGGERTY
                    Goodnight boys. Do you need the
                    light on to take off your clothes?

                              NICK
                    No.
                        (flipping off the light)
                    We can find our zippers in the
                    dark.

          

                                                                    76.

          
          A beat of BLACKNESS. Then a light tap at the door.
          There is the sound of Sheeni getting out of bed. She cracks
          the door, letting in just enough light from the hall that a
          MALE SHADOW gets cast across the two boys on the floor.
          Nick squints and tries to hear what Sheeni and the male
          shadow are whispering to each other.
          After a beat, Sheeni closes the door and the room plunges
          into BLACKNESS once again. Nick listens as Sheeni climbs back
          into bed as if nothing happened.

                                 NICK
                    Sheeni?

                                 SHEENI
                    Yes, Nick?

                              NICK
                    Was that the matron?

                                 SHEENI
                    No.
          Beat.

                              NICK
                    Then who was it?

                              SHEENI
                    It was Trent.
          Beat.

                              NICK
                    Did you say it was Trent?

                              SHEENI
                    Yes. He came to discuss our
                    friendship. I told him now was not
                    the time.

                              NICK
                    So where is Trent now?

                               SHEENI
                    I assume he went back to the boys'
                    dorm. Now really, Nickie, you are
                    keeping everyone awake with your
                    inquiries.
          Though silence follows, we take a moment to allow Nick's mind
          to race in the dark. He stands and looks at the mirror above
          the dresser. FranÃ§ois can be made out sitting by the window
          in the moonlight, stroking the Thompson.

          

                                                                    77.

          

                              FRANÃOIS
                    Now is our chance.

                              NICK
                    Chance for what?

                              FRANÃOIS
                    To confront our nemesis. We must go
                    to the boys' dorm and kill Trent
                    where he sleeps.

                              NICK
                    I suppose we should at least get a
                    look at him. To see what we're
                    dealing with.

                               FRANÃOIS
                    Very well.
                        (stubbing out his

                         CIGARETTE)
                    You see what we are dealing with...
                    and zen I wll deal wiz it.
          And with that he cocks the Thompson for dramatic flare.

          INT. GIRLS' DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Nick emerges from the room in nothing but his underwear and a
          whindbreaker. He creeps down the hall.

          EXT. ECOLE DES ARTS ET LITTERATURE - GROUNDS - NIGHT

          The school SECURITY VAN crawls by in the background, a
          searchlight sweeping the grounds.
          The moment it is out of sight, Nick darts from the bushes of
          the girls' dorm and races across the campus to the boys'
          dorm.

          INT. BOYS DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Nick makes his way down the hall, checking the names on the
          colored paper cut-out shapes that adorn the doors.
          He stops and backtracks when he spots the door that boasts
          the names TRENT and ED.
          Nick knocks on the door.
          It opens inward to reveal a bare-chested, hulking athlete in
          a pajama pants. This is ED SOLOMON.

                              NICK
                    Trent?

                              ED
                    No. Who the hell are you?

          

                                                                   78.

          

                              NICK
                    I am Nick Twisp.

                              ED
                    Oh, so you're Nick.

                              NICK
                    Is Trent here?

                              ED
                    You just missed him, Nick. He just
                    grabbed a couple condoms and left.

                              NICK
                    Did he say where he was going?

                              ED
                    I think he said he was going to
                    Heather's room.

                              NICK
                    But that's where Lefty is. Who are
                    you?

                              ED
                    Ed. Ed Solomon. Trent's roommate.

                              NICK
                    Oh, so you're Ed.

                              ED
                    What's that supposed to mean?

                              NICK
                    Nothing. It's just that Sheeni
                    mentioned Trent has a thing for a
                    guy named Ed, and that he touches
                    the guy when he falls asleep. But
                    obviously if that were you, you'd
                    know about it. Must be a different
                    Ed Solomon. Take care now.
          Nick takes off running and Ed stares after him.

          EXT. ECOLE DES ARTS ET LITTERATURE - GROUNDS - NIGHT

          The security van continues to make its rounds. We find Nick
          crouching behind the steps to the boys dorm.
          He pulls the hood of his windbreaker over his head and takes
          a deep breath.
          As the searchlight passes by, he makes a break for it.
          TRACK with Nick as he darts from one form of cover to the
          next, perhaps accompanied by the imagined sounds of mortar
          blasts and machine gun turret fire.

          

                                                                  79.

          

          
          At long last he reaches the girls' dorm undetected.

          INT. GIRLS' DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Nick bangs on the door. Heather answers in little more than a
          G-string and Nick seems to forget his mission just long
          enough to appreciate her body.

                              HEATHER
                    What's up, Nick?

                              NICK
                    Is Trent in there?

                              HEATHER
                    Not anymore.

                              NICK
                    What happened to Lefty?

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    I'm right here, Nick.
          Nick peers past Heather where he finds Lefty standing naked
          in the moonlight.

                              HEATHER
                    Trent was here, but he left. He
                    only dropped by to lend us a couple
                    more condoms.

                              NICK
                    But I gave Lefty two already.

                              HEATHER
                    Yes, and that was very generous of
                    you, but the night is young.

                              NICK
                    So what is Trent, the fucking
                    condom faerie!?!

                              LEFTY
                    You can have one of ours, Nick. If
                    you need one.
          The fact that Nick doesn't yet raises his temperament even
          further.

                              NICK
                    So where did he say he was going?

                              HEATHER
                    He didn't say, but I'm pretty sure
                    I just saw him go into our bathroom
                    down the hall.

          

                                                                    80.

          

                              NICK
                    Thanks. Oh, and I'd be careful with
                    those condoms. Trent's roommate Ed
                    said that Trent pokes holes in them
                    so that he can get Sheeni pregnant
                    and be with her forever.
          And with that piece of disturbing info, he leaves them.

          INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          There is the CLAP of thunder outside as Nick throws open the
          door to the girls' bathroom. He looks around with murderous
          rage.
          There comes the sound of someone vomiting.
          Nick kicks in the stall and finds BERNICE LYNCH, 17, a thin
          platinum haired girl with six earrings per lobe. She hurls
          into the toilet again and turns around to find Nick.

                              BERNICE
                    Who are you?

                              NICK
                    I'm Sheeni's friend, Nick. Sorry to
                    disturb you.

                               BERNICE
                    That's OK. It was something I ate.
                    So wait, are you Sheeni's
                    boyfriend?

                                NICK
                    Uh, yeah.

                              BERNICE
                    My name's Bernice. Bernice Lynch.
                    Not that you asked.

                              NICK
                    Nice to meet you Bernice. Actually,
                    I think Trent Preston mentioned
                    you. He said you were frumpy, but
                    now that I've met you, I can see
                    Trent is a lying bastard.

                              BERNICE
                    Thanks. And Trent can go to hell
                    for all I care. Sheeni too.

                              NICK
                    You don't like Sheeni?

          

                                                                     81.

          

                              BERNICE
                    Personally, I hate her guts. Well,
                    pardon me, Nick. I feel like
                    throwing up some more now.

                              NICK
                    You didn't happen to see Trent
                    Preston did you?
          She waves him away as she bends over the sink to hurl again.
          Then lifts her face and smiles through the dripping bile.

                              BERNICE
                    I did actually. I think he was on
                    his way to Sheeni's room.
          Nick's eyes widen in alarm.

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking.
          Vijay and Taggarty grunt away on the top bunk.
          He watches the moon lit forms thumping together.
          He turns his attention to the sleeping beauty on the bottom
          bunk. He moves toward her.
          She blinks, waking and smiles at the sight of him.

                                 NICK
                    Sheeni?

                              SHEENI
                    Yes, darling.

                              NICK
                    Was Trent here?

                                 SHEENI
                    Yes, Nick.
          Nick hangs his head.

                              SHEENI
                    But I sent him away again.
          Nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty, but he
          finds nothing but adoration.

                              SHEENI
                    Because I want you, darling. Not
                    even Trent can match the
                    industriousness and tenacity with
                    which you have pursued me.

          

                                                                     82.

          
          She smiles. Nick smiles too. She reaches out to pull him into
          her bed as...
          The door to the room slams open and they are suddenly backlit
          by the harsh beam of the matron's flashlight.

                              MATRON
                    Q'est que c'est passer ici?!?
          Nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk.
          He lands on the floor, where he gets a view of... Trent
          standing behind the matron. The blinding light makes his
          features difficult to make out but his white teeth are
          definitely smiling diabolically.

          EXT. GIRLS' DORM - NIGHT

          The boys come out of the front door of the dormitory, the
          matron, flanked by SCHOOL SECURITY GUARDS, hot on their
          heels. The girls in the dorm appear on the balcony in droves,
          cheering the boys' escape.
          Vijay's pants fall to his ankles, tripping him up.
          Nick and Lefty grab Vijay by the arms and pull him up again
          as if he were a wounded war buddy in a retreat from the
          Vietnamese Army.
          They reach the Beamer at the edge of the grounds. Nick gets
          in first. Lefty dives through the back window, legs kicking.
          Vijay slams the door just as the matron and her security team
          catches up to them. The authorities bang on the windows as
          Nick peels out.
          INDIAN POP blares from the car. They speed off into the
          night.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT
          Lefty lets out a holler of joy.

                              LEFTY
                    I did it three times! Two long ones
                    and a quickie.

                              NICK
                    Great. Just great. How about you,
                    Vijay?

                              VIJAY
                    It was difficult to tell with that
                    condom, Nick. Why did you buy such
                    thick ones?

                               NICK
                    That brand was top-rated by
                    Consumers.

          

                                                                  83.

          

                              VIJAY
                    Well, she's safe. No organism could
                    penetrate those walls.

                              NICK
                    You think the girls are in trouble?

                              VIJAY
                    They will likely notify their
                    parents. Perhaps even expel them.

                              NICK
                    That's it! Expel them. Then Sheeni
                    will have to come back to Ukiah.
          The car sputters. Nick's eyes go to the gas gauge.

          EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT

          The rain is coming down again. Nick shivers in his underwear.
          Vijay isn't in much more and Lefty's sheet is drenched.

                              VIJAY
                    What will we do?

                              NICK
                    Well, we can't stay in the car.
                    Sooner or later Highway Patrol is
                    going to come by and ask for our
                    non-existent driver's license.

                              LEFTY
                    But we have no money!

                              VIJAY
                    I have no shoes! I'll catch
                    pneumonia and die a indeterminate
                    proto-quasi-virgin!

          EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT

          A couple coins are inserted into a roadside pay phone. There
          is ringing on the other end.

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    Hello?

                              NICK
                        (into phone)
                    Mom? It's Nick. I'm sorry to wake
                    you, but I'm hoping you'll help
                    your only son. Especially seeing as
                    it would really piss off Dad.
          A long beat.

          

                                                                    84.

          

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    Where are you, Nick?

          EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - RAINING - NIGHT

          The three boys are still standing in the rain by the pay
          phone. The three of them huddle under their only windbreaker.
          A pair of headlights appear in the rain. The headlights flash
          twice and Nick runs out into the road.

          POV TRUCK DRIVER
          Nick waving frantically in nothing but tightie-whities.
          The truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door opens to
          reveal, the driver, a man named WALLY RUMPKIN, a seven foot
          tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls. He looks down
          at our three waylaid adventurers.

                              WALLY
                    Pardon me. But is one of you Nick
                    Twisp?
          The two other boys exchange confused glances, not entirely if
          this is how people go missing.

                              NICK
                    Yeah. I'm Nick.

                              WALLY
                    I'm Wally. I'm a friend of your
                    mom's.
          Nick nods, not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is
          actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being
          sent on a midnight mission.

                              WALLY
                    So, uhm, uh... Your mom says you
                    need a ride. Did I mention I'm a
                    friend?
          Nick breaks into a smile. Finally the Gods have cut him a
          break.

          INT. ESTELLE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Wally and Estelle watch the three semi-clothed boys shovel in
          fried liver with no complaint.

                              ESTELLE
                    Wally was a friend of Jerry's. He
                    came to help me in my time of
                    mourning.

          

                                                                  85.

          

                              NICK
                    What happened to Lance?
          Estelle's face registers "none of your business," but a kind
          look from Wally and she softens.

                              ESTELLE
                    Lance is busy training to be a
                    detective. He isn't around as much
                    as he used to be.
          Nick nods and goes back to eating.

                              ESTELLE
                    Mr. Rumpkin is very smart. Ask him
                    a question, Nick.

                              NICK
                    Okay. Mr. Rumpkin, what famous
                    actress was married to Frank
                    Sinatra, Artie Shaw, and Mickey
                    Rooney?

                              LEFTY
                    Whoever she is, she sure gets
                    around.

                              WALLY
                    Ava Gardner.
          Estelle smiles with pride. Nick and the other boys regard the
          gentle giant with admiration. He bashfully averts his eyes.

                              ESTELLE
                    That's nothing. You should see what
                    he did with the living room.

          INT. ESTELLE'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Nick and the other two boys pause in the doorway.
          Where once the Chevy occupied the space, the living room was
          now fairly returned to it's normal uncluttered state with all
          the furniture placed back in the original positions.
          At some point Wally must have sawed a hole in the wall shared
          by the living and dining areas because the Chevy now occupies
          that hole and has been painted and decorated such that it has
          achieved an almost seamless blend with the wall.
          Estelle goes and takes a seat on the couch.

                              ESTELLE
                    Go ahead, Wally. Show them.
          Wally blushes before he flips a switch and the tail lights
          come on, giving the living room a warm, flattering glow.

          

                                                                     86.

          

                                NICK, LEFTY, VIJAY
                    Ooooooh.
          Wally flips another switch and the car's radio turns on.

                                NICK, LEFTY, VIJAY
                    Aaaaaaah.
          Wally makes a slightly embarrassed gesture of scratching his
          head before lumbering over to the couch and taking a seat
          next to Estelle.
          Nick watches as Wally puts his arm around his mother and they
          listen to the Chevy play them Elvis' LOVE ME TENDER.
          The two adults snuggle in the glow of the tail lights and it
          brings an unexpected rush of caring in his expression.

          EXT. UKIAH - DAY

          The truck rumbles to a stop and the three boys climb out.
          Nick looks, over his shoulder at Wally blushing behind the
          wheel of the truck.

                               WALLY
                    Well, uhm... It was nice meeting
                    you, Nick.

                              NICK
                    You too, Mr. Rumpkin.
          Wally blushes even more. He closes the door and starts to
          turn the truck around. Nick watches him go. Wally waves
          goodbye.
          Nick turns and the three boys make their way down the dusty
          road.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          Lacey works up a sweat to Billy Blank. Nick comes through the
          door. He's still in his underwear.

                              NICK
                    Where's Dad?

                              LACEY
                    In the bedroom. I wouldn't bother
                    him, Nick. He's in a foul mood.
                    He's on with the police. Apparently
                    someone broke in and stole his
                    Beamer.
          Lacey gives Nick an amused smile.

                              GEORGE (O.S.)
                    Lacey! Get in here!

          

                                                                  87.

          
          Lacey rolls her eyes and heads for the bedroom. Nick sits
          down with Dwayne at the breakfast table.

                              DWAYNE
                    Nick, you got a girlfriend?

                                 NICK
                    Yes, I do.

                              DWAYNE
                    If you asked your girlfriend as a
                    favor, would she do it with me?

                              NICK
                    Guys don't share their girlfriends.

                              DWAYNE
                    I get ya. You're worried `cause
                    your girlfriend might get knocked
                    up. What if I pull out, Nick?
          Nick seethes inwardly. There comes a ruckus from the back
          bedroom and Lacey emerges.

                              LACEY
                    It's not my fault, you tight-assed,
                    critical, nonfeeling, sexist drunk.

                              GEORGE (O.S.)
                    Sticks and stones. It doesn't
                    bother me if you sleep on the couch
                    from now on.

                              LACEY
                    Does it bother you that you're a
                    selfish, uptight, boring lover?

                              NICK
                    You forgot lousy driver!
          George appears in the doorway.

                              GEORGE
                    That's strike two, jerkoff!
          Nick hangs his head. George moves about the kitchen chugging
          from a jug of zin. Lacey picks up the ringing phone.

                               LACEY
                    Hello?

                        (PAUSE)
                    Thank you.
          Lacey hangs up the phone.

          

                                                                  88.

          

                              LACEY
                    They found your car in Davenport,
                    George. Go pick it up.

                              GEORGE
                    Look who's wearing the pants this
                    morning.
          Lacey takes a seat next to Nick and sighs.

                              LACEY
                    Nick, I feel for you. It must be
                    tough being a teenager in this
                    house.

                              NICK
                    My mother wasn't any better.

                              LACEY
                    Your mom has had a difficult time.
                    She has had a great deal to put up
                    with. I'm starting to appreciate
                    that now.

                              GEORGE
                    Are you by any chance referring to
                    me?

                              LACEY
                    If the shoe fits, suck on it.
          George swills some zin and mumbles ominously.

                              GEORGE
                    We'll see who's sucking on what
                    soon.

          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY


                              VIJAY
                    I spoke with Taggarty this morning.
                    She requested a wallet sized photo.
          Nick looks up glumly from his lunch. Lefty has his feet up on
          the table, his facial growth is almost respectable.

                              LEFTY
                    Congratulations, Vijay. That makes
                    it official. Welcome to the club.
          Nick narrows his eyes at the two non-virgins.

                              NICK
                    What grade did you receive?

          

                                                                    89.

          

                              VIJAY
                    A C+. Which I feel is perfectly
                    satisfactory given the conditions.

                              LEFTY
                    I guess this means they're not
                    being expelled.

                              VIJAY
                    No, apparently they convinced the
                    matron it was all quite innocent.

                              NICK
                    Are you kidding? She had her
                    flashlight trained on your Hindi
                    boner!
          A beat. Lefty and Vijay seem taken aback by the outburst.

                              VIJAY
                    No need to be jealous, Nick.
          Nick stands and collects his lunch tray.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    If I'm to get Sheeni expelled and
                    sent back to me I will need a
                    partner in crime.

          INT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - COMPUTER LAB - DAY

          Nick enters the computer lab and finds an open machine.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Luckily, FranÃ§ois has a girl on the
                    inside.
          Nick begins typing and speaking out loud.

                              NICK
                    Dear Bernice, it was nice meeting
                    you this weekend in the bathroom.

          INT. BERNICE'S ROOM - DAY

          Bernice reads the letter.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I just want you to know I now see
                    why you loath Sheeni Saunders so
                    strongly.

          INT. HEADMASTER'S OFFICE - DAY

          Sheeni, Taggarty, and Heather sit across from the HEADMASTER
          as the matron describes the events.

          

                                                                  90.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I too have come to despise the
                    snooty, pretentious brunette and in
                    all honesty you should probably get
                    her expelled. I am happy to help in
                    that regard.

          INT. BERNICE'S ROOM - DAY


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I have included a number of
                    sleeping pills with this note.
          Bernice dumps the pills from the envelope.

          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    You must introduce one of these
                    into her breakfast beverage each
                    day.
          Bernice sits next to Sheeni, despite the fact she's being
          ignored. Bernice drops a pill into Sheeni's coffee
          nonchalantly.

          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          Sheeni watches the INSTRUCTOR.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    She may be intelligent, but she is
                    not likely to pass her courses when
                    she's falling asleep in class.
          Sheeni's head slips off her hand as she drifts off. We MOVE
          across the classroom to where Bernice scribbles in her
          notebook.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Since meeting you, I have come to
                    realize my interest in Sheeni was
                    only a transient adolescent
                    infatuation. I like you more than I
                    can say. Take courage. Together we
                    will outsmart these cake eaters.
          A view of the notebook shows her to be scribbling Nick's name
          with hearts. She flips through pages of obsession.

          INT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - COMPUTER LAB - DAY

          Nick's fingers fly across the keys. He looks pleased with
          himself.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Affectionately yours, Nick.

          

                                                                     91.

          
          He looks around for observers, looks back at the screen
          pensively, and resumes typing.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    P.S. Please destroy this note
                    immediately.

          ON A MAILBOX
          As Nick deposits his letter.

          EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - EVENING

          Nick wanders up the drive. WE FOLLOW him into the house.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - CONTINUOUS

          ...where he comes upon the sight of Paul giving Lacey a foot
          message on the couch.

                              NICK
                    Where's Dad?

                              LACEY

                        (DREAMILY)
                    Daddy is in Davenport. Where you
                    left his car.

                              PAUL
                    We saved you some mushrooms, Nick.
          Nick watches the sensual foot message. He picks up the bag
          full of mushrooms and considers them.

          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Nick pukes his guts into the sink.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick's in bed reading Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets.
          He glances up at Dwayne playing Nintendo and scowls.
          There comes the strange warbled sound of a TRUMPET from the
          next room, and it is joined by other instruments until we
          hear The Nutley Brass' rendition of I WANT TO BE SEDATED.
          Nick furrows his eyebrows in confusion.

          ON THE BOOK
          as the nude figures suddenly BECOME ANIMATED, making
          wonderful love.
          Nick follows them with his eyes as they float off the page.

          

                                                                  92.

          
          WE FOLLOW Nick as he follows the nude figures who do
          acrobatics down...

          THE HALL
          and into...

          THE LIVING ROOM
          where Lacey watches Paul blow on his trumpet.
          Nick marvels. The phone rings.

                               LACEY
                     Nick? Get the phone?
          Nick picks up the phone and Paul takes his place at Lacey's
          feet.

                               NICK
                         (into phone)
                     Hello?

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - NIGHT
          George cradles the cell phone. WE INTERCUT.

                               GEORGE
                     Nick? Is that you?

                               NICK
                     I am Nick Twisp. I am alive. I am a
                     breathing organism.

                               GEORGE
                     Quit fooling around, Nick. This is
                     your dad. Is everything okay there?

                               NICK
                     Don't be afraid, Dad. Everything
                     will be okay. You deserve to be
                     loved.

                               GEORGE
                     What the hell is that supposed to
                     mean? Is Lacey there?

                               NICK
                     Lacey is here. Paul is caressing
                     her toes.

                               GEORGE
                     Paul! Who the hell is Paul?

          

                                                                     93.

          

                              NICK
                    Paul is our friend. He makes
                    beautiful music for the acrobats.
                    They're naked.

                              GEORGE
                    Who's naked? Is Lacey naked?

                              NICK
                    Don't be afraid, Dad. Goodbye.
          He hangs up the phone and pulls out the cord.
          He joins Paul in working Lacey's feet.

                              NICK
                    Dad is afraid.

                              LACEY
                    He is on the wrong path. I have
                    felt that for some time.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick watches the headlights from the arriving BMW travel
          across the walls.
          They go out. He listens to the front door being keyed
          followed by his father bellowing.
          Nick gets up and wanders into...

          LIVING ROOM
          where Paul stands between George and Lacey.

                              PAUL
                    Okay, George, just calm down.
          George lunges and Paul socks him in the eye, dropping him to
          the floor.

                              GEORGE
                    You are in serious trouble. You've
                    assaulted me and I know for a fact
                    that you two were having naked
                    orgies with my son. That child is
                    only twelve years old.
          George gets to his feet.

                              NICK
                    I'm sixteen, Dad.

          

                                                                  94.

          

                               GEORGE
                    Shut your pie hole!
                        (turning to Lacey and

                         PAUL)
                    That boy is an underaged minor. I'm
                    going to have you arrested and
                    charged with child molesting.

                               LACEY
                    Don't be an idiot, George. No one
                    was naked.

                              GEORGE
                    When you get out of prison, you
                    will both have to register as sex
                    offenders. You will never be able
                    to get a decent job again.

                              PAUL
                    I've never had a decent job. I
                    don't think I'd want one.

                              LACEY
                    Let's go, Paul. George, I'll pick
                    up the rest of my things tomorrow.

                              GEORGE
                    Not until you pay me the rest of
                    the money you owe.

                              LACEY
                    I paid you all your money!

                              GEORGE
                    Not the extra charges.
          She gets up in his face.

                              LACEY
                    Fuck-your-stinking-extra-charges.
          As Lacey and Paul depart, Nick turns and dreamily wanders
          back toward his room.

                              GEORGE (O.S.)
                    Using bad language in front of a
                    minor. The judge will hear about
                    that too.
          Nick gets back into his room and closes the door behind him.
          SWISH TO... Dwayne playing Nintendo naked. He looks over his
          shoulder.

                              DWAYNE
                    What's all the ruckus about?

          

                                                                  95.

          

                              NICK
                    Dwayne! Please cover yourself.

                              DWAYNE
                    You wanna play Nintendo all night?

                              NICK
                    Of course not. I'm tired. Let's go
                    to sleep.
          Nick unplugs the Nintendo and climbs into bed. Dwayne just
          sits there on the floor, naked as a clam.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - THE DEAD OF NIGHT


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    A strange night. I dreamed of
                    wrestling for what seemed like
                    hours with an amorous walrus...
          Nick squirms with an amorphous blob, they wrestle against the
          red abstract background.

          INT. NICK'S ROOM - MORNING

          Nick's bleary eyes snap open and wander to the floor, where
          his pajamas lie in a crumpled pile.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    There is only one explanation: I
                    have been Dwayned.
          A pillow whacks across a blubbery face.

                              NICK
                    Wake up! I know what you were doing
                    last night, you disgusting beast!

                              DWAYNE
                    Don't be mad, Nick. I like you.
          Dwayne throws off his sheets. Nick shudders at the sight.
          ...which is when Mrs. Crampton barges in..

                              MRS. CRAMPTON
                    Boys, time to get-- AHH! Dwayne!
                    Where's yer pajamas?

                              DWAYNE
                    Nick made me take them off, Mom. He
                    took off his too.

                              MRS. CRAMPTON
                    You leave my son alone. Don't go
                    co'rupt him with yer nastiness!

          

                                                                     96.

          

                              NICK
                    We weren't doing anything, Mrs.
                    Crampton. It was just hot last
                    night.

                              MRS. CRAMPTON
                    If you get hot, boys, open a
                    window. Don't go takin' off yer
                    pajamas. That's nasty.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          Nick dials on the phone. Behind him, Dwayne eats breakfast,
          cheerfully kicking his feet back and forth under the chair.

                               TAGGARTY (V.O.)
                    Bonjour.

                              NICK
                    Taggarty? It's Nick.

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - DAY

          Taggarty's at her desk. Her thick rimmed glasses almost make
          her look studious. WE INTERCUT.

                              TAGGARTY
                    Hey, Nick. I suppose you want to
                    talk to Sheeni.

                              NICK
                    If you please.
          Taggarty crosses to the bunks, where Sheeni is curled up
          among the sheets as if in some Renaissance portrait.

                              TAGGARTY
                    It's your would-be-lover.
          Sheeni sleepily takes the phone.

                               SHEENI
                    Nick?

                              NICK
                    Hello, My Beloved. How are you?

                              SHEENI
                    Not so well. I have been afflicted
                    with some kind of chronic fatigue.

                              NICK
                    Perhaps you are home sick. You do
                    sound rather blue.

          

                                                97.

          

                    SHEENI
          I'm not home sick, Nick. In fact,
          I'm not very happy with you.

                    NICK
          Me? What did I do?

                    SHEENI
          You know damn well, Nick. You've
          been spreading rumors about Trent.
          And he doesn't deserve it.

                    NICK
          Doesn't deserve it!?! I'd have to
          claim he has genital warts to sink
          to his level.

                    SHEENI
          Well, whatever you said to Ed
          Solomon, it was enough to get him
          to give Trent a black eye.

                    NICK
          Sheeni, I just don't get it. This
          guy has cock-blocked at every turn
          and you're taking his side?!?

                    SHEENI
          Cock-blocked?

              (SIGHS)
          We'll have to resume this another
          time, Nick. It's been an
          emotionally exhausting weekend. My
          parents are in an uproar over Paul.
          He's moved some floozie in with him
          up in the studio over the garage.

                    NICK
          Lacey's not a floozie.

                    SHEENI
          Lacey? You know her?

                    NICK
          Of course. She's my father's ex-
          girlfriend. I think that might make
          you my stepmother-in-law.

                    SHEENI
          Nick. Don't be gross.

                    NICK
          Sorry. At any rate, I'll let you
          go. We'll have plenty of time to
          settle this tomorrow.

          

                                                                     98.

          

                                SHEENI
                    Tomorrow?

                              NICK
                    Yes, Sheeni, Thanksgiving. I'll be
                    coming for dinner, of course.

                              SHEENI
                    Don't even think it, Nick. You know
                    my parents don't approve of you.

                              NICK
                    I'm confident they will learn to
                    love me. After all, I'm practically
                    family.

                              SHEENI
                    Nick, you must dismiss this
                    Thanksgiving notion from your mind.
                    I remain firm on this issue.
                    Goodbye.
          CLICK. Nick regards the phone defensively. He puts it down
          and takes a seat at the table.
          He glares at Dwayne as they eat breakfast. There comes a
          knock at the front door.

                              NICK
                    Don't move, blubber boy, I'll get
                    it.

          I/E. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY
          A POLICE OFFICER stands on the steps. Nick goes wide eyed at
          the sight of him and visibly slumps.

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    Is George Twisp in?

                              NICK
                    Uh, I'm pretty sure he's sleeping
                    off a hangover, Officer. Is he
                    under arrest?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    Under arrest? No, I'm the officer
                    working the case of his stolen car.

                                NICK
                    Ah.

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    You can tell your pop that the CD
                    he found in his car is Ravi
                    Shankar.

          

                                                                  99.

          

                                 NICK
                    Excuse me?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    Indian music. So we're a checkin'
                    the INS files, see if we can get
                    some prints that match. You
                    wouldn't know anyone who might have
                    stolen the car who listens to this
                    crap, would ya, son?

                              NICK
                    No, and I'm not sure I like the
                    implication. Ravi Shankar is
                    beloved by many Caucasian...

                              DWAYNE (O.S.)
                    What about Vijay Joshi?
          Nick stands stiff as a board. The officer peers around him at
          Dwayne sitting inside.

                              DWAYNE
                    I'm pretty sure he's Injun.
          The officer makes a note.

                              POLICE OFFICER
                        (to himself)
                    Vijay Joshi. We'll look into it.
                    Thank you, boys.
          Nick gives a weak smile and closes the door.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Mrs. Crampton complained to Dad
                    that I tried to corrupt the fat
                    pervert cohabitating with me.

          EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          Nick totes boxes of belongings from the house to the
          Crampton's dilapidated camper.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    He has deemed it strike three, but
                    is only banishing me as far as Mrs.
                    Crampton's condemned trailer.

          INT. CAMPER - NIGHT

          A view of the thin birch walls. We come to rest on Nick,
          shivering under an electric blanket. There's a blob of snot
          on his upper-lip.

          

                                                                    100.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    No matter. Tomorrow I will be
                    reunited with My Everlasting Love.
                    And I will not be stopped. Not by
                    an outbreak of the plague, nor by a
                    cruel return of the ice-age. Not
                    even by the Gods themselves.

          EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          The velvet voices of the Rat Pack come from the home.
          Nick emerges from the Camper wrapped in the electric blanket.
          He scurries into the house.

          INT. BATHRROOM - DAY

          Nick showers.
          Nick straightens his Garcia tie in the mirror. He applies
          hair gel.
          Nick examines the whitehead on his brow. He pinches and a
          glob of puss smacks the mirror.

          INT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - HALLWAY - DAY

          He emerges into the hall and dances with an invisible partner
          into the...

          LIVING ROOM
          where the phone RINGS. He flips off the stereo with the
          remote and snatches up the phone.

                              NICK
                    Twisp residence.

                                 ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    Nick?

                              NICK
                    Oh. Hey, Mom. What's up?

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    Nickie, I have some bad news!
          Nick sighs.

                              NICK
                    Okay. I'm ready. What is it?

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    I'm afraid Lance and Wally got into
                    a terrible row. He tried to arrest
                    Wally and Wally broke Lance's jaw.

          

                                                                    101.

          

                              NICK
                    What's the bad news?

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    The Berkeley police know you
                    started the fire. Lance told them
                    where you are.
          Nick glances up and sees the black and white patrol car
          pulling up outside.

                              ESTELLE (V.O.)
                    Nick, they're coming to arrest you!
          He slams down the phone.

          EXT. GEORGE'S MANUFACTURED HOME - DAY

          The window slides open and Nick comes crawling out, leaping
          to the ground. He takes off running through the woods.

          EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

          Nick pounds on the door.

                              LEFTY (O.S.)
                    Nick?
          Nick turns to find Lefty coming up the path with two bags of
          groceries under his arms.

                              NICK
                    Lefty, have you seen Vijay, today?

                              LEFTY
                    Nick, haven't you heard? Vijay's
                    been arrested.

                              NICK
                    Arrested?!?

                              LEFTY
                    For grand theft auto. They found
                    his prints in your father's car.

                              NICK
                    That's terrible. Did he go quietly?

                              LEFTY
                    No. He said you were his accomplice
                    and now the Ukiah police are
                    looking for you!
          We linger a beat on Nick's blank expression. Then -

          

                                                                   102.

          

          EXT. WOODS - DUSK

          We're off and running through the woods, trying to keep up
          with Nick as he flees.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    The day has proven to be a
                    disaster. Where did I gone wrong? I
                    have a decision to make.

          EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The spotlight from the overhead helicopter sweeps over the
          bridge and continues down the road.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    I could hit the road and spend my
                    life a fugitive with my integrity
                    nearly intact.

          UNDER THE BRIDGE
          Nick squats in the shadows. He's holding a bouquet of
          municipal flowers and dabs the sweat on his head with his
          tie.

                               NICK (V.O.)
                    It's that or risk incarceration to
                    keep my dinner date.

                        (BEAT)
                    Obviously the answer is clear.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

          Nick peers through the bushes at the mobile home across the
          street. A squad car crawls past, the rover squawking a terse
          description of a teenage white male.
          Nick emerges from the shrubs and approaches the house.
          He rings the ornate Victorian doorbell. Paul answers in an
          apron.

                              PAUL
                    Hello, Nick. Right on time. Come
                    in.

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

          Lacey floats toward him and gives him a hug.

                              NICK
                    Happy Thanksgiving, Lacey.
          She spots the sad flowers in his hand.

          

                                                                 103.

          

                              LACEY
                    What interesting flowers, Nick. Who
                    are they for?

                              NICK
                    Uh, Mrs. Saunders.
          Lacey leads him by the hand into the chintz-bedecked parlor.
          Sheeni's larger-than-life father and 5,000 year old mother
          sit cross-legged on the floor, running their hands over the
          hooked rug.

                              LACEY
                    Mr. and Mrs. Saunders, you remember
                    Nick Twisp, don't you?
          Mrs. Saunders coos and takes the flowers. Her husband squints
          up at him.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    You are very, very tall.

                              PAUL
                    No he's not, Dad. He just appears
                    tall because you are on the floor.

                              MR. SAUNDERS
                    I can feel the floor pushing
                    against me. Can you feel it too,
                    tall youth?
          Nick glances over at Mrs. Saunders who is now eating the
          flowers.

                              LACEY
                    Paul served an appetizer earlier.

                              PAUL
                    Yes, it's a recipe I picked up in
                    the Southwest. Stuffed mushrooms.
          Nick smiles with amusement.

                              TAGGERTY (O.S.)
                    Hello, Nick.
          Taggarty makes her entrance down the stairs, cloaked in a
          green cape.

                              TAGGERTY
                    How is the star-crossed persistent
                    lover?
          She greets him with a casually intimate kiss.

          

                                                                 104.

          

                              NICK
                    Okay, I guess. Where's Sheeni?

                              TAGGERTY
                    Upstairs, Nick. She saw you coming
                    and hid in her room.

          INT. SHEENI'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Nick knocks and enters to find Sheeni sprawled on the bed
          with a book.

                              NICK
                    Dinner is almost ready, My Love.

                              SHEENI
                    I do not intend to be party to my
                    brother's absurdities. He has
                    allowed you in and drugged my
                    parents.

                              NICK
                    I think they are deriving some good
                    from the experience.
          Sheeni finally looks up from her book.

                              SHEENI
                    What are you doing here, Nick? I
                    expressly asked you not to come.

                              NICK
                    To hell with that. What do I have
                    to do to prove my love to you? My
                    friends have gotten laid and I'm
                    pretty sure neither one of them was
                    beaten with a tree trunk, raped by
                    a walrus, or had to contend with
                    the likes of Trent Preston!

                              SHEENI
                    You were raped by a walrus?

                              NICK
                    Sheeni, I have shown restraint, I
                    have committed crimes, I have
                    traveled to the lengths of the
                    state and still you won't give me
                    this one little thing.

                              SHEENI
                    Sex, Nick. Why don't you just say
                    it? That's what you want. You want
                    me to have sex with you.

          

                                                                    105.

                    Well... YEAH!
          A beat as Nick's open admissions makes her consider his
          point. She sighs and shakes her head.

                              SHEENI
                    How is my dog?

                              NICK
                    Excellent. He should be coming out
                    of the oven right about now.
          She tosses the book at him, but he dodges it successfully.

                              SHEENI
                    I hate you, Nickie!
          She stands up and tries to slap him. He grabs her wrists and
          pulls her to him.

                              NICK
                    I hate you too.
          They share a long, intense kiss.
          They break away and she smiles in spite of herself.

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

          The Saunders and extended family take their seats at the
          polished mahogany table crammed with turkey, yams, mashed
          potatoes, and cranberry sauce.
          They all lower their heads and Lacey leads them in prayer.

                              LACEY
                    Dear Lord...
          Mr. Saunders emits a long, low, fog horn of a fart that ends
          badly.
          The others exchange glances but he and his wife still have
          their heads solemnly bowed.

                              LACEY
                    Dear Lord, thank you for this
                    bounty. Help us to be tolerant of
                    others - especially the boyfriends
                    and girlfriends of our immediate
                    relations. Amen.

                              EVERYONE
                    Amen.

          

                                                                 106.

          
          They begin eating. A helicopter passes by outside, search
          light briefly coming through the windows.
          Nick watches Mr. Saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes
          and apply it to his face like war paint.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS
                    Paul? Your father looks rather
                    strange.

                              PAUL
                    Well, mother, he is sitting in his
                    own bowel movement.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS
                    That's no excuse.
          Another helicopter passes overhead.

                              TAGGARTY
                    The food is delicious, Paul.

                               PAUL
                    Thank you.

                        (BEAT)
                    Sister, darling, how long has it
                    been since we all observed the
                    rituals of Thanksgiving?

                              SHEENI
                    Not long enough, Paul.

                              NICK
                    I hope it's the first of many such
                    occasions for me.
          Sheeni narrows her eyes at him.
          A long beat as they all dine in silence. Then-
          Mrs. Saunders croaks out in song.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS
                    Siiiilent night, Hooooly night/
                    Aaaall in calm, aaall is bright...
          Paul begins humming approvingly and one by one the others
          accompany her as Mr. Saunders pretends to conduct them with a
          drumstick.

                              EVERYONE
                    Round yon virgin Mother and Child/
                    Holy infant so tender and mild/
                    Sleep in heavenly peace... Sle-eep
                    in heavenly pee-eace.

          

                                                                    107.

          
          And with that, the doorbell rings. Taggarty gets up and opens
          the door.

                              TAGGARTY
                    Oh, Trent, you made it.
          Nick glances up with a start as TRENT PRESTON makes his
          entrance. He's not quite the deity Nick's expected, but
          rather a fairly plain, blond with slightly androgenous
          features and a certain flamboyance. His black eye, courtesy
          of Ed Solomon, still remains.

                              TRENT
                    Hello, Taggarty. Hello, Everyone.
          Mr. Saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the
          pitcher and pours water into his own lap.

                              SHEENI
                    Trent, darling, this is Nick.
          Trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes.

                              TRENT
                    Nick, at last we meet.

                              NICK
                    Hello, Trent.

                              TAGGARTY
                    Have a seat, Trent.

                              TRENT
                    I'm sorry, Taggarty, I can't stay.
                    I have bad news.

                              SHEENI
                    What is it?

                              TRENT
                    Bernice Lynch has tried to commit
                    suicide.
          Sheeni and Taggarty gasp. Nick swallows hard.

                              TRENT
                    She swallowed a number of sleeping
                    pills, and is now in a coma.

                              SHEENI
                    The poor girl.

                              TRENT
                    There's more. Before I left school,
                    I searched her room.

          

                                                                 108.

          

                              NICK
                    Did you obtain proper authorization
                    from the officials?

                              TRENT
                    No, Nick, I acted on my own
                    initiative. In Bernice's closet, I
                    found this letter.
          He dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket.

                              TRENT
                    In the letter, the writer
                    instructed Bernice to begin
                    sedating Sheeni with drugs he
                    himself supplied.

                              TAGGARTY
                    Nick, you didn't!

                              NICK
                    Well, you see...

                              SHEENI
                    Nick! You could have killed me!

                                MR. SAUNDERS
                    Who died?

                              TRENT
                    No one yet, Mr. Saunders.
          Mrs. Saunders points a liver spotted finger in his direction.

                              MRS. SAUNDERS

                    ARREST HIM!

                              TRENT
                    I can't arrest him. But I have
                    called the Santa Cruz Police. They
                    are on their way here now.
          Nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands.

                              NICK
                    Well, I shall be going now. Please
                    continue without me.

                              TRENT
                    Nick, I suggest you remain here and
                    face the consequences like a man.
          Nick stops in front of Trent.

          

                                                                   109.

          

                              NICK
                    Thank you for that unsolicited
                    counsel, Trent. And please, do drop
                    dead.
          The other guests murmur their shock. Nick stops in the
          doorway.

                              NICK
                    Goodbye, Sheeni. I did it all for
                    you.

                              SHEENI
                    You are completely contemptible,
                    Nick Twisp. I never wish to see you
                    again.
          With the dreadful proclamation ringing in his ears, Nick
          leaves.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Nick's silhouette figure racing through the trees.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Here I am, reviled by friends and
                    family. Relentlessly pursued by
                    three police jurisdictions.
          Nick stops at the edge of the woods to catch his breath.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    FronÃ§ois suggests we flee the
                    country. But where to go? Mexico?
                    Canada? India, perhaps?
          He looks up the road which has been blocked off by flashing
          squad cars.

          EXT. LOS ANGELES - ESTABLISHING - DAY

          The downtown high-rises protrude from the layer of smog. In
          pre-lap, someone pushes a door BUZZER repeatedly.

          INT. JOANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Joanie opens the door and finds Nick on her doorstep.

                              NICK
                    Uh, Hi, Joanie. How's it going?

                               JOANIE
                    Nick?

          

                                                                 110.

          

          INT. JOANIE'S APARTMENT - LATER


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Since my sister can see through me,
                    I'm obliged to give a relatively
                    candid and thorough review of the
                    events.
          Joanie listens gravely, shaking her head at the most gruesome
          parts of the story. Nick finishes, flopping into a chair.

                              JOANIE
                    Nick, six months ago you were just
                    another brownnosing honor student.
                    What happened?

                              NICK
                    I'm not really sure. I fell in love
                    with Sheeni. All I want is to be
                    with her. The rest is all a big
                    misunderstanding.

                              JOANIE
                    Nick, you've stolen, vandalized,
                    trespassed, and burned down
                    Berkeley. All for one girl. If
                    there's a misunderstanding, it's
                    with your insight into females.

                              NICK
                    But... But where did I go wrong?

                              JOANIE
                    Nick, boys your age are always
                    looking for the path of least
                    resistance to becoming a man. A
                    boy's whole self-esteem rests on
                    how fast he can get a girl into
                    bed.

                              NICK
                    So far, I agree.

                              JOANIE
                    Sooner or later what those boys
                    realize, is that the girls you're
                    chasing base their self-esteem on
                    how many hoops they can get the boy
                    to jump through before going to bed
                    with him.
          Nick furrows his brow. Clearly that had not occurred to him.

                              JOANIE
                    So I guess what you should ask
                    yourself is: How far are you
                    willing to go?

          

                                                                 111.

          
          Nick nods in understanding. An epiphanic smile.

                              NICK
                    All the way, Joanie. I'm willing to
                    go all the way.
          Joanie nods in amusement.

                              JOANIE
                    You can stay here a couple days,
                    but eventually they'll come looking
                    for you. I don't have much money to
                    give you, but here.
          Nick takes the wad of cash, clearly moved.

                              NICK
                    Thanks, Joanie. I... Uh... I love
                    you.

                              JOANIE
                    I love you too, you little brat.

          Nick slaps the cash on the counter and slides it under the

                    One ticket to Ukiah, please.

                    Yeah.

          Nick is crammed into the phone booth. He's wearing shades and
          a fedora. WE INTERCUT.

                    No matter, they'll get you
                    eventually.

                              NICK
                    Let me make it easy. I'll be at
                    Redwood High School tomorrow
                    morning. Round up your donut
                    dipping friends. I'm turning myself
                    in.
          Nick slams down the phone before Lance can respond.

          I/E. BUS (MOVING) - DAY
          Nick sits by the window, the suitcase on the seat next to
          him.

          EXT. UKIAH - DAY

          And the bus flies past the sign that says WELCOME TO UKIAH.

          EXT. UKIAH BUS STOP - NIGHT

          Nick steps off the bus and finds Lefty loading his belongings
          underneath.

                              NICK
                    Lefty?
          Lefty lifts his eyes and sees his friend.

                              LEFTY
                    Nick? What are you doing here?
                    Everyone and their mother's mother
                    is looking for you.

                               NICK
                    They have me soon enough. Where are
                    you going?

                              LEFTY
                    Home. I'm done being dead, Nick.
                    Heather and I are going back to
                    Oakland for Christmas. You should
                    have heard how glad my parents were
                    that I didn't kill myself. They
                    were even happier when they found
                    out I'm not gay.

                              NICK
                    That's great, Lefty.

                              LEFTY
                    Yeah, being in love is pretty
                    great. So what's your plan, Nick?

          

                                                                    113.

          
          Nick answers with only pensive silence.

          EXT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - NIGHT

          Nick is about to knock on the door when Paul opens it in
          another display of clairvoyance.

                              PAUL
                    Welcome back, Nick. We had a
                    feeling you were coming.

          INT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - LATER

          Nick sits beside Paul and Lacey on the couch as they watch
          the infamous "chicken scene" in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Paul and Lacey are kind enough to
                    share some leftover fungi to help
                    calm my nerves. That, combined with
                    yet another viewing of James Dean's
                    performance is what gives me my
                    final burst of inspiration.
          They all watch transfixed as JAMES DEAN leaps from his
          automobile just in time to escape demise.

          INT. PAUL'S HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - LATER

          As the END CREDITS of REBEL play behind them, Lacey fits a
          bombshell wig on Nick's head and finishes the last touches of
          make-up that make him...
          ...who we will come to know as CARLOTTA ULANSKY. Nick regards
          his female alter-ego in the mirror.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    FranÃ§ois of course wants no part of
                    this, and demands that we make a
                    run for the border. But I have
                    decided to veto him. It's time to
                    face the music.

          INT. BMW 325I - DAY

          Nick turns the key in the ignition and CHRISTMAS MUSIC rises
          from the speakers. And the music plays over...

          EXT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          ...where a crowd begins to form in anticipation of Nick's
          arrival.
          Nick watches from behind a tree on the ridge.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

          ...where police cars and news crews are pulling up to
          interview the students.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. REDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

          The parking lot is now filled with police cruisers and FBI
          vans, the news crews, REDWOOD HIGH STUDENTS, and an
          apparently CALIFORNIA WIDE NICK TWISP CULT FOLLOWING.
          TINA MANION, 17, speaks into a STUDENT NEWS CREW CAMERA.

                                 TINA
                       This is Tina Manion reporting live
                       at Redwood High in Ukiah where
                       local law enforcement as well as
                       the FBI awaits the promised arrival
                       of Nick Twisp.
          There comes a murmur from the crowd and Tina directs the
          student camera-man to the road on the ridge where...
          George's BMW pulls to a stop overlooking the school.

                                 GEORGE
                       Hey. That's my car!
          The crowd hushes as the door opens and Nick emerges.

          NICK'S POV
          of the parking lot below, which looks like the kind of turn
          out one would expect of a Star Wars prequel.

          ON THE VARIOUS FACES OF THE CROWD
          staring up in silence. Estelle, Wally, Vijay, Trent, Dwayne,
          George, Lacey, Paul...
          Nick gives a little wave as if he were a celebrity.
          The parking lot erupts with CHEERS of his name. A few
          Berkeley KIDS hold up a sign that reads I'M SINGLE, LET'S

          MINGLE.
          Then - shouts of warning from the megaphones.
          And as the flashers and sirens come to life, Nick jumps back
          into his father's car and peels out.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
          Nick glances in the rear view mirror as the cops bear through
          the cloud kicked up in his wake.

          

                                                                    115.

          
          Nick pops in a CD and turns up the Christmas music to drown
          out the sirens.

          EXT. COVERED BRIDGE - DAY

          He zips across the covered bridge, the train of law
          enforcement in hot pursuit.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
          He yanks the wheel hard and veers off onto the mountain road.
          A few of the squad cars miss the turn and skid side-long
          through a picket fence.
          Nick takes the switchbacks at 60 per, wheels practically
          sliding off the turns.

          EXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - DAY

          The BMW crests the hill and smashes through the chain link
          gate.

          I/E. BMW 325I (MOVING) - DAY
          As Nick watches the quickly approaching cliffs edge, he
          undoes his seat belt.
          He goes for the door handle, eyes going wide when he finds
          power lock has engaged.

          EXT. BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - DAY

          The BMW hurtles off the bluff and soars through the air,
          tires spinning, a plume of snow blowing off the hood.
          The car descends into a nose dive and flips completely upside-
          down, hitting the ice covered surface of Clear Lake with a
          thundering SMACK.
          Police cars swerve to a stop at the edge of the bluff and the
          crowd of officers and agents peer over the side at the hole
          in the ice.

          UNDERWATER
          The BMW descends toward us in a storm of air bubbles.
          As it gently touches down at the bottom of the lake, a somber
          TRUMPET SOLO comes in pre-lap and we are...

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          Where a crowd of family, friends, and fans stand around in
          mourning garb over the funeral ceremony.

          

                                                                    116.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    My only comfort regarding my
                    untimely death is knowing my
                    friends and family will do just
                    fine without me.
          We move from Lacey and Paul, the latter of which is wailing
          away on the trumpet, to Lefty, his head hung low. Heather
          pulls his head to her breasts.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    As it would turn out Heather's
                    vaginal canal is slightly
                    misshapen...

          INT. HILLS ABOVE UC CAMPUS - FLASHFORWARD - DAY

          Lefty humping Heather in the grass ala the scene in which we
          met him.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...and thus completely compatible
                    with Lefty's otherwise incongruent
                    penis.

                              HEATHER
                    A little to the right... a
                    little... RIGHT THERE! RIGHT THERE!

                    RIGHTTHERERIGHTTHERERIGHTTHERE!

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          ...where we find Vijay glancing over at Taggarty as she
          smokes a cigarette.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Vijay would eventually manage to
                    pin the car theft on me. But had
                    lost the attention of Taggarty
                    forever. Who by the way...

          INT. SHEENI'S DORM ROOM - FLASHFORWARD - NIGHT


                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...never would find her perfect A.
          Taggarty at her wall. Ed Solomon lounges in the bed behind
          her.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    And would therefore start grading
                    on a curve.
          With a quick stroke of her pen, she changes Ed's grade from a
          B minus to a B plus.

          

                                                                 117.

          

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          ...where we find Joanie sniffling.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Joanie of course would get to
                    continue to travel the world...

          INT. AIRPLANE (35,000 FT) - FLASHFORWARD - DAY

          Joanie serves up a beverage in first class.

                              NICK   (V.O.)
                    ...and she and   her breasts would
                    probably go on   to have the
                    wonderful life   that they deserve.
          The CELEBRITY she is serving looks from her cleavage to her
          eyes. She gives a little smile.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          ...where we find Estelle weeping quietly against Wally's
          shoulder.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Wally as it turns out...

          INT. JEOPARDY STUDIO - FLASHFORWARD - NIGHT

          Estelle watches from the audience as Wally scribbles at his
          podium while ALEX TREBECK hosts inaudibly.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...would go on Jeopardy and win,
                    ensuring my mother's blessed rise
                    to a higher economic status.
          The answer on Wally's screen says WHO IS ALBERT CAMUS? Alex
          Trebeck shakes his head, leaving Wally with only $1, but
          enough to best his two competitors.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          ...where we find George puffing on a cigar, Mrs. Crampton
          behind him, his hand resting on Dwayne's shoulder.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...my father, no longer burdened
                    with crippling child support
                    payments, would now be able to
                    afford the model BMW he always
                    wanted...

          

                                                                 118.

          

          I/E. BMW M6SMG - MOVING - FLASHFORWARD - DAY
          Dwayne sticks his head out the window and shouts with glee as
          his flab flaps in the wind.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    ...and would come to find the
                    surrogate son he always wanted in
                    Dwayne, the only organism alive
                    that could possibly appreciate
                    George's driving.
          As the car accelerates, we see the vanity plate reads THUNDER

          ROD.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Leaving just one last piece of
                    business.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

          And finally we arrive on Sheeni, expressionless. And as we
          continue to PAN we reach...
          Carlotta standing in the background. The bombshell haircut
          and thick glasses can barely be made out through her veil.
          Paul finishes his trumpet solo and there is a moment of
          silence to observe the open casket and the SINGLE, LET'S
          MINGLE shirt and shorts that are being buried inside.

          EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK

          Sheeni makes her way toward the line of limos and hearses.
          She approaches the distant Carlotta.

                              SHEENI
                    Excuse me. Are you a friend of
                    Nick's?
          Carlotta looks up, startled. She composes herself and shakes
          Sheeni's hand.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    A terribly old friend. Carlotta
                    Ulanksy. I'm sorry for your loss.

                              SHEENI
                    You shouldn't be, Carlotta. I am no
                    doubt culpable for Nick's actions.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Well, love does compel us to
                    desperate acts. People cannot
                    always act rationally.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA (cont'd)
                    The greater the love, the stronger
                    the passions, the more reckless the
                    crimes.
          Sheeni lets go a slight, wistful smile.

                              SHEENI
                    Yes, Carlotta. Nick had wonderful a
                    way of making me feel worthy of the
                    pursuit.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    My dear, if there's one thing the
                    demise of Nick Twisp has taught me,
                    it's that self worth comes from
                    within.
          Sheeni gives a pensive nod.

                              SHEENI
                    Would you like to stay the night,
                    Carlotta? We can reminisce of our
                    departed.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Oh, my. A kind offer, but I really
                    must...

                              SHEENI
                    It's just... I don't think I could
                    bear to be alone tonight.
          Carlotta does her best not to look conflicted, but it shows.

          INT. SHEENI'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Carlotta hurriedly finishes tucking herself in while Sheeni
          brushes in the bathroom.
          Carlotta hastily switches out the light. Sheeni emerges in a
          few small scraps of flimsy black lace.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Goodness. What an attractive
                    negligee.

                              SHEENI
                    Do you like it? I bought it in
                    Santa Rosa last fall. I had hoped
                    to wear it for Nick.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Oh, darling, I'm sure he would have
                    found it most... Appealing.
          Sheeni crawls into bed. She cuddles close.

          

                                                                   120.

          

                              SHEENI
                    I like lying here with you,
                    Carlotta.

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    You do?

                              SHEENI
                    I can't think of anyone I'd rather
                    lie here with.
          Carlotta furrows her brow.

                              SHEENI
                    Except maybe Nick. If Nick were
                    here, what do you suppose he would
                    do to me?

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Make love to you I would think.

                              SHEENI
                    Then why don't you?

                              NICK/CARLOTTA
                    Pardon?

                              SHEENI
                    Take off that silly wig and make
                    love to me!
          Sheeni tugs off the wig and tosses it across the room.

                              NICK
                    Sheeni! You knew!

                              SHEENI
                    Of course, Nick. Did you really
                    expect to fool your soul mate with
                    such a disguise?
          Nick swoons, grasping her gauze-glazed nakedness.

                              SHEENI
                    Take me darling!
          And as they engage in a feverish kiss, ROUSING HYMNS surge.
          The church chorus' joyful song rings Hallelujah.
          The two lovers are entwined before an abstract RED

          BACKGROUND.

          LAS VEGAS OF THE BODY
          Into the NICK'S PENIS nightclub where champagne bottles POP
          with the ringing in of a new era, and the Leopards ROAR, and
          the stage erupts with fireworks.

          

                                                                 121.

          

          INT. SHEENI'S ROOM - MORNING

          Nick sleeps with a grin on his face. He rouses at the touch
          of Sheeni's lips on his cheek.

                              SHEENI
                    My parents are at services. They
                    won't be back for hours.

                              NICK
                    Shall we have breakfast, my love?

                              SHEENI
                    What a lovely notion, darling. You
                    go ahead downstairs and get things
                    started.
          Sheeni hauls herself out of bed and grabs the phone off the
          cradle.

                              NICK
                    What are you doing?

                              SHEENI
                    Calling Taggarty to report that you
                    are not completely incompetent in
                    the bedroom.

                              NICK
                    Do I get to stay and hear my grade?

                              SHEENI
                    Not a chance, Mr. Twisp. Such
                    things are reserved for girl talk
                    only. And for good reason.
          She smiles at him and he smiles back.

                              NICK
                    Very well, Sheeni. Don't be long.

          INT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          Nick prances into the living room in his underwear.
          He starts to head into the kitchen when he catches sight of
          the full length mirror out of the corner of his eye. He stops
          in front of the mirror and flexes his biceps. Admires
          himself.
          FranÃ§ois appears in the mirror behind Nick, Thompson slung
          over his shoulder.

                              NICK
                    Well, good morning, FranÃ§ois. What
                    do you think?

          

                                                                 122.

          

                              FRANÃOIS
                    What do I sink? I sink now's are
                    chance to run for ze hills.
          Nick lowers his arms and furrows his brow.

                              NICK
                    What do you mean?

                              FRANÃOIS
                    Nick, we are young, yes? Is the
                    world not our oyster? Beaucoup des
                    filles. Do you not want to know
                    what it is like to make love to
                    another girl?

                              NICK
                    I do, but... We've come so far.
                    What about Sheeni?

                              FRANÃOIS
                    Forget Sheeni. Yes, she will always
                    be ze first conquest, but all zis
                    time you saught zis was ze end, ze
                    one and only, when in fact it is
                    only ze beginning.
          Nick lifts his eyebrows with dawning epiphany.
          In the reflection we can see behind Nick as Albert leaps onto
          the love seat and barks at the sound of approaching sirens.
          Nick runs to the window just in time to see half a dozen law
          enforcement vehicles pull up.

                              NICK
                    Sheeni, the police are here!
          He ducks down from the window as a chopper buzzes overhead.

                              NICK
                    Quick! Maybe I can sneak out the
                    back!

                              MEGAPHONE (O.S.)

                    NICK TWISP! WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED!

                              NICK
                    I don't understand. How do they
                    even know I'm alive?

                              SHEENI (O.S.)
                    Well, I called them of course.
          Nick spins to face her. She's standing in the doorway and
          there's not a hint of wrong-doing in her face.

          

                                                                  123.

          

                              NICK
                    Well, thanks a pantsful!

                              SHEENI
                    But, Nickie, it had to be done.

                              NICK
                    But... but why?

                              SHEENI
                    I can't very well marry a wanted
                    man, honey. Look at it this way, in
                    a few months you'll be a free man
                    and we can be together in Paris.
          Nick looks to FranÃ§ois in disbelief. But the Frenchman just
          rolls his eyes.

                               FRANÃOIS
                    You might as well break it to her
                    now, Nick.
          A long pensive beat as Nick contemplates telling her he may
          never see her again. But behind Sheeni's air of control, Nick
          finally sees the vulnerability he's had in his hands all
          along.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    FranÃ§ois is right of course, but on
                    the other hand, why be cruel? After
                    all, Sheeni had managed to give me
                    hope every step of the way. And if
                    hope is what Sheeni would now need
                    to go on, well then...

                              NICK
                    As always, you are right, my love.
          Sheeni beams. FranÃ§ois smacks his forehead with hand.

                              FRANÃOIS
                    Merd.
          The Frenchman in the mirror sticks the barrel of the Thompson
          in his mouth and blows himself OUT OF FRAME just as...
          ...the front door bursts open and the FBI AGENTS surround
          Nick.

          EXT. SAUNDERS' MOBILE HOME - DAY

          The agents lead Nick to the caravan of law enforcement parked
          in the road.

          

                                                                   124.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Arrested? Ha. It may not appear so,
                    but the truth is... I've got the
                    world on a string.
          Sheeni emerges from the home, Albert barking in protest.
          Nick strains against his cuffs to look over his shoulder at
          her.

                              SHEENI
                    Write often, Nickie.

                              NICK
                    I will, darling.

                              SHEENI
                    And don't worry about Albert. He'll
                    be waiting for you too.

                               NICK (V.O.)
                    As FranÃ§ois would remind me, I'm
                    intelligent, healthy, virile, not
                    violently ugly... On the whole I am
                    splendidly equipped for this great
                    adventure we call the human
                    existence.
          The FBI agents shove Nick into the back of their black
          Saturn.

          INT. SATURN(MOVING) - DAY

          Nick watches out the back window as the car pulls away. A
          view of Sheeni waving in the road, Albert at her feet.

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    Besides, what jury would convict a
                    teenager who acted out of love?
                    And even if I do get to spend the
                    next few months of my youth getting
                    Dwayned by the inmates of the
                    California Juvenile Correctional
                    System, I did get my thirty two
                    minutes of lovemaking with one of
                    the most outstanding girls of this
                    or any other epoch.
          Nick turns to face the front while behind him the waving
          figure gets ever more distant. A pensive moment as he
          actually questions...

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    But was it all worth it?
          Nick revisits those thirty two minutes in his mind and it
          brings a smirk to his face.
          

                                                                  125.

          

                              NICK (V.O.)
                    You bet your left nut it was.
          And as Tom Jones' SHE'S A LADY kicks in, we...
          

                                                             THE END

          EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
          
          Mist. Dark trees.     Dripping vines.        An ENGINE RUMBLES in the
          distance.
          
          The full moon shimmers on a puddle.          A FROG SPLATS IN,
          splashing a one man pup tent.
          
          INSIDE THE TENT
          
          LUKE's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen
          asleep reading by flashlight. He's nineteen, still slightly
          awkward and unaware he's growing handsome.
          
          He listens as the ENGINE RUMBLES LOUDER, closer.
          
          He peers out through the tent flap. Glaring head lamps ROAR
          toward him. Scrambling out of his sleeping bag, he HURLS
          himself against the side of the tent, as...
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          an RV CAMPER nearly plows down the tent, skidding to a stop
          in the mud.
          
          Stillness.
          
          Luke extricates himself from the tent.          He runs to the driver-
          side window of the RV.
          
                                 LUKE
                       Are you all right?
          
          Inside, ALEXA, thirties, earthy, looks up at him bleary-eyed.
          She nods 'yes.'
          
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                       How did you even get here?       There's
                       no road.
          
                                    ALEXA
                       I'm sorry.     I'm from Utah.
          
                                    LUKE
                       It's okay.
          
                                 ALEXA
                       Are you alone out here?
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          
          He nods 'yes.'    She bursts into TEARS.
          
                              ALEXA (CONT'D)
                    My husband. Bastard. I've been
                    driving for days. I don't even
                    know where I'm going.
          
                                LUKE
                    Oh, wow.    I'm really sorry.
          
          She gathers herself, sniffling.
          
          
                    I have warm apple kringel in the
                    camper. Would you like some?
          
                              LUKE
                    Uh, what is it?
          
                                ALEXA
                    Pastry.
          
          
          INSIDE RV CAMPER
          
          Luke stands at the RV's tiny kitchen counter, wolfing pastry
          off a paper plate.
          
                              ALEXA
                    So, this "Survival Quest" is your
                    vacation?
          
                               LUKE
                    Yeah. It's my third try.     Kind a'
                    lame, huh?
          
                              ALEXA
                    No. Seven days alone in the
                    wilderness?   I'd be afraid.
          
                              LUKE
                    It's just something I really wanted
                    to do.
          
          Luke notices an odd pile of stuff by the sink.
          
                              ALEXA
                    His shoes. Fishing lures.        The
                    electric drill.
          
                                LUKE
                    Good.
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
          
          She smiles, grateful, eyeing his torn t-shirt and shorts.
          
                              ALEXA
                    You're all wet and muddy. Why
                    don't I hang those up to dry?
          
                                LUKE
                    Thanks.    I'm okay.
          
                              ALEXA
                    I'm propositioning you.
          
                                LUKE
                    Oh...
                    Oh, wow.
                    You are?
          
          He considers, fearful, but thrilled.
          
          
          EXT. LANGFORD UNIVERSITY - MORNING
          
          Students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle.
          
          The huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old
          SEMI-TRUCK RUMBLES up to the curb. It's the cab only, like
          the sliced-off front of a train engine.
          
          Luke hops down, startling his friends, KEENAN and JANINE,
          passionately making out on the sidewalk.
          
          Twenty, brainy and athletic, Janine adjusts her glasses, the
          only remnant of a bookish past, as she thoughtfully considers
          Luke's massive truck.
          
                              JANINE
                    It's remarkable. Sort of retro. I
                    thought you were gettin' a pickup?
          
                              LUKE
                    I changed my mind.
          
          Hoping for a more enthusiastic response, he turns to Keenan,
          who climbs up and peeks inside the cab. He's rugged,
          streetwise, perpetually bemused, -maybe Ed Norton and Bill
          Murray had a son...
          
                              KEENAN
                    It's awesome. It's pleather.
          
                                LUKE
                    Fuck you.    You think it's stupid.
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
          Janine stares at him.
          
                                LUKE (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
          She shrugs, trying to put her finger on it, and when Luke
          rolls up his T-shirt sleeves, she grins.
          
                                LUKE (CONT'D)
                    What?!
          
                              JANINE
                    Oh my God. You got laid.
                    Finally! Who is she?
          
          Luke glares at Keenan.
          
                              KEENAN
                    I didn't say a word! I swear!     You
                    know Janine. She's got X-ray
                    vision.
                        (to Janine)
                    Camping! A total stranger.
          
                              JANINE
                    I knew that whole "waitin' to meet
                    the right girl" thing was crap.
                    Congratulations! I have to get to
                    Physics. The truck's great.
          
                              KEENAN
                    See ya', hottie.
          
                              JANINE
                    Could find something to call me,
                    other than what every guy in the
                    world would say?
          
                              KEENAN
                    "Sweetheart?" "Babe?"
                    "Aphrodite?"
          
          Janine sneers.    At a loss, Keenan grabs her and kisses her
          passionately.
          
          She walks off rolling her eyes, but secretly loves it.
          
          Keenan climbs up into the cab.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    So this is gonna' be like your car?
          
                                                                      5.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Look, I know it's dopey. But don't
                    you recognize it? It's painted and
                    the muffler's switched out, -but
                    this was my dad's.
          
          Keenan looks around with fresh eyes. He reaches an arm way
          up under the glove box and GRINS, pulling out a small stash
          of weed.
          
                                 KEENAN
                    Ten years.     A little dried out.
          
          
          EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY
          
          The truck barrels along through the trees.     Luke and Keenan
          share a joint.
          
                              LUKE
                    First off, that woman. We didn't
                    go all the way, you know?
          
                               KEENAN
                    Yeah?   Okay, so?
          
                              LUKE
                    You think technically I'm still a
                    virgin?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Were you inside her?
          
                                 LUKE
                    Yeah.
          
                                 KEENAN
                    It counts.     Next.   ...What?
          
                              LUKE
                    I been havin' this weird dream.
                    The thing is, I think maybe the
                    dream's real. Forget it. No way
                    I'm tellin' you.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You know enough of my secrets to
                    get me shot. Sharon's mom on
                    Thanksgiving? What the fuck dream
                    is there you can't tell me?
          
                                                                      6.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    It's about part of me gettin'
                    smaller. An important part.
          
          Keenan looks over warily, then busts out LAUGHING, then
          realizes Luke's serious.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You have gotta' be fuckin' kiddin'
                    me. You're not thirteen!
          
                                 LUKE
                    Screw you.     Maybe I caught
                    something.
          
                              KEENAN
                    I think it's good you bought this
                    truck.
          
          They both LAUGH.
          
          
          INT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - DAY
          
          A small, run-down service garage, crammed with tires, tools
          and discarded car parts.
          
          Luke's truck idles in the service bay, billowing smoke.
          
          MAX, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder-length hair
          and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag.
          
          Dripping with masculinity, he swaggers around the truck,
          chewing gum, wielding a pneumatic torque-wrench, which he
          occasionally REVS for emphasis.
          
                              MAX
                    I can do the gasket for twenty
                    bucks. But new T-sprocks, for this
                    thing? Two, three hundred, maybe?
          
                                LUKE
                    Shit.    Can I hold off on that?
          
                              MAX
                    No skin off my ass. But a few
                    days, weeks, your whole
                    transmission could blow.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Ah, Jeez.     I shouldn't got this.
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
          
          Max considers, sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and
          SIGHS.
          
                              MAX
                    Four hundred seventy-five
                    horsepower. Twenty-eight inch
                    wheels. It's a classic. Let me
                    dig around out back. Maybe we got
                    a used set.
          
                              LUKE
                    That'd be great.   Thanks.
          
          Max disappears through a squeaky door at the back.
          
          Luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender.
          
          He sits, impatient for Max to return.
          
          He examines Max's cap, tries it on. He picks up the torque-
          wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner
          of Max.
          
          He spins around and REVS the wrench, catching sight of
          MICHELLE, twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and T-
          shirt, with warm, confident eyes.
          
          Luke swallows, wide-eyed, a deer in headlights.   He sets
          down the torque-wrench.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    It's not my wrench. It's my truck.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    What's wrong with it?
          
                              LUKE
                    Oh, just needs a new gasket and a
                    couple T-sprocks. The flanges are
                    sheared off.   No big deal.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    You have to watch my brother, Max.
                    He's sellin' you "T-sprocks?"
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah?
          
                              MICHELLE
                    There's no such thing. Last week
                    he sold Mrs. Gustafson a whole set:
                    six hundred bucks. My name's
                    Michelle.
          
                                                                     8.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    From New York. Poli-Sci transfer.
                    I sort of asked around campus.
          
                               MICHELLE
                    You did?
          
                              LUKE
                    You've prob'ly already got a
                    stalker, huh?
          
                               MICHELLE
                    No.
          
          Luke stares, awkward.
          
                              LUKE
                    You heard about Cafe Lunizia?
                    Italian? They got New York style
                    pizza. Make you feel at home.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    You askin' me out?
          
                              LUKE
                    Oh, well, uh, -definitely!
          
          An SUV pulls up at the gas pump, stuffed with Keenan and
          OTHER GUYS. CHAD, exuding supreme self-confidence, calls
          over to Luke as he pumps gas.
          
                              CHAD
                    Hey, Spanky, let's go! Look
                    forward to kickin' your puck ass.
          
                               LUKE
                    My ride.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Your name's "Spanky?"
          
                              LUKE
                    No, Puck Ass, but people just call
                    me Luke. We're beatin' his frat
                    boy team in street hockey. Pisses
                    'em off.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    I'll talk to Max. Tell him to just
                    replace the gasket.
          
          Luke's BREATHING grows HEAVIER.
          
                                                                       9.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Thanks. So, what do you think?
                    I'll just sit there while you eat.
                    I won't even talk.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Look, I just split up with this
                    total amoeba.
          
                              LUKE
                    Oh, I'm a paramecium. That's way
                    more evolved. I'm practically pond
                    scum.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Maybe I'll give you a call when the
                    truck's ready.
          
                               LUKE
                    Great.    You mean to go out, right?
          
          Michelle smiles, and walks out through the squeaky door at
          the back. Keenan approaches.
          
                              KEENAN
                        (a whisper)
                    Whoa. That was her!     Jesus, you're
                    sweatin' like crazy.
          
          Luke sits, nods 'yes,' wipes BEADS of SWEAT from his brow.
          
                              LUKE
                    We're goin' out.
          
          Keenan gives him a high-five.    Luke smiles, catching his
          breath.
          
          
          INT. LUKE & KEENAN'S PLACE
          
          A small, run-down house. Hockey gear, dirty laundry and
          Keenan are strewn across the garage-sale sofa. He munches a
          burrito while watching the game.
          
                               LUKE (O.S.)
                    KEENAN!   COME HERE, QUICK!!!
          
          Keenan leaps up.
          
                               KEENAN
                    WHAT?!
          
          He races down the hall, sliding on the linoleum.
          
                                                                     10.
          
          
          
          BATHROOM
          
          Luke, a towel around his waist, stares at himself in the
          mirror, horrified.
          
                                LUKE
                     Look!   My chest!
          
          Keenan looks, clueless, a little uncomfortable now.
          
                                 KEENAN
                     Yeah?
          
                               LUKE
                     I had hair. Come on! Not a lot,
                     but you've seen me -some- right?
          
                               KEENAN
                     Okay, I don't know.    So?
          
                               LUKE
                     Well, where'd it go?
          
          Keenan takes a bite of the burrito in his hand, now mashed.
          
                               KEENAN
                     I really thought you gettin' laid
                     was gonna' help. What is it with
                     you, man? I mean, you're smarter
                     than me, you're better lookin' than
                     me.
          
                                 LUKE
                     I am not.
          
                               KEENAN
                     I know. But I'm just sayin', you
                     can get any girl you want.
          
                               LUKE
                     Easy for you, you've got Janine.
          
                               KEENAN
                     I'm still workin' on my GED. How
                     long you think Brainiac's gonna'
                     wanna' hang with that?
          
                               LUKE
                     She worships you.
          
                                                                  11.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    Man, I'm gonna' be that wild fling
                    she had with the local dude from
                    the bike shop. "God, what was his
                    name?"
          
                              LUKE
                    You're crazy.
          
          Keenan gives him a look of "I'm crazy?"
          
                              KEENAN
                    You're gonna' have a great time
                    with her tonight. Just be
                    yourself. ...Mostly.
          
          
          EXT. CAFE LUNIZIA - NIGHT
          
          Cheap elegance. Luke and Michelle dine on the patio, strung
          with far too many white lights.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    I caught him with my best friend.
                    Former. Such a cliche'.
          
                                LUKE
                    Sorry.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Winthrop Hawkins. "Hawk." From
                    this Park Avenue family. He'd know
                    what kind of mushrooms those are,
                    what the best wine is.
          
                              LUKE
                    The best wine is beer.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    I'm such a moron.
          
                              LUKE
                    You're not.
          
                                MICHELLE
                    No, I am.    I have incontrovertible
                    proof.
          
          She kicks off her shoe and sticks her bare foot on the table,
          a TATTOO of a GREEN BIRD on her ankle.
          
                                                                  12.
          
          
          
                              MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    It's a hawk. Get it? "Hawkins?"
                    See, you're smirking!
          
                               LUKE
                    I'm not.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    And it's GREEN! That's the one
                    color tattoo they can't REMOVE!
          
                               LUKE
                    Oh.   Bummer.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    I'm considering a prosthetic foot.
          
          She smiles.
          
          They sip from their glasses and drink each other in.
          
          Luke contemplates a kiss,...
          
          but his breathing grows shallow, he GASPS.
          
                              MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    What's the matter?
          
                              LUKE
                    Nothin'. Maybe just kind a' hot
                    out here. You want moron? When my
                    dad died, -it's okay, I was nine.
                    I barely knew what was goin' on-
                    But I thought the tombstone was
                    really sad looking, so I painted
                    smiley faces and fish all over it.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    That's sweet.
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah, I'm sure dad would've loved
                    that.
          
          His face REDDENS. Overheated, Luke tugs at his shirt,
          brushes SWEAT from his brow.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    So, what do you think makes a good
                    relationship?
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    For real? I don't know.
                    Friendship. Great sex. Knowing
                    you want to be there even when it
                    gets scary or bloody.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                    Whoa.     Where'd that come from?
          
                                 LUKE
                    Sorry.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    No, it's just not the usual guy
                    thing. ...You're great, you know?
          
          Luke puts his hand on his chest, FEELS something.
          
          He stands, puts on his jacket.
          
                              LUKE
                    Will you excuse me a sec'?
          
          
          NEAR THE KITCHEN
          
          HYPER-VENTILATING, his arms CLUTCHING HIS CHEST,
          
          BEADS OF SWEAT on his forehead,
          
          Luke checks the Men's Room door: LOCKED.
          
          He ducks out the service entrance.
          
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT
          By the dumpster, Luke reaches behind his head, WHIPS off his
          jacket and shirt, and looks down...
          
          His eyes GO WIDE.
          
                                 LUKE
                    -AAH!
          
          On his chest: FEMALE BREASTS.
          
          Two WAITERS come outside for a smoke.
          
                              FIRST WAITER
                    Table twenty-nine. Like to bring
                    her the cannoli special.
          
                                                                  14.
          
          
          
          Luke peers over the dumpster, down at his breasts, with a
          HIGH FEVER, and PASSES OUT, slumping to the ground.
          
          BEHIND THE DUMPSTER - LATE NIGHT
          
          Luke's eyes open, dilated, disoriented. He's lying on the
          ground, shirtless among bits of garbage.
          
          He watches bleary-eyed, as a MOUSE peers at him from inside
          an empty milk carton. The mouse runs over and sniffs at a
          canteloupe, which triggers Luke's memory:
          
          He GRABS his chest, relieved to find it's back to normal.
          
          He stands, dizzy, surveying the dark, locked restaurant, and
          staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck.
          
          
          EXT. WOODED HIGHWAY - LATE NIGHT
          
          Luke's Semi THUNDERS along.
          
          INSIDE THE CAB
          
          Luke stares out in shock.
          
          He hears HEAVY BREATHING, MOANS, VOICES.
          
                               FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Oh yes!   Don't stop!
          
          He looks around for the source of the sounds, glances over.
          
          RIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR
          
          in it's reflection a leering male, stripped to the waist.
          
                              MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    Lie down for me, baby!
          
          The HEAD LAMPS of an oncoming car FLASH at him.
          
          As he glances out the driver-side window, MUSIC BLARES from
          the passing car.
          
          INSIDE THE CAR
          
          A glimpse of what might be an ORGY of BODIES intertwined.
          
          The FEMALE DRIVER - GRINS MANIACALLY UP at Luke as the CAR
          HORN SCREAMS by.
          
          Luke CAREENS to one side, glancing at the truck's
          
                                                                    15.
          
          
          
          LEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR
          
          The car recedes in the distance, but the Female Driver
          appears CLOSE in the mirror's reflection, LEERING. She LICKS
          THE MIRROR from the inside, and disappears.
          
          THROUGH THE TRUCK WINDSHIELD
          
          Luke stares out, EYES GLAZED.
          
          
          INT. KEENAN AND LUKE'S GARAGE
          
          The decrepit old garage looks as if it may collapse any
          second. Barbells on the floor. Luke dodges and weaves,
          slugging a makeshift punching bag.
          
          Keenan appears, wiping sleep from his eyes.
          
                              KEENAN
                    We takin' up boxing?
          
                              LUKE
                    I don't know. I am.
          
                              KEENAN
                    What's goin' on? You competin' for
                    Mr. Universe this week?
          
                              LUKE
                    Everyone should just mind their own
                    fucking business!
          
          Keenan recoils at the attitude.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Didn't go so great, huh?
          
          Luke punches the bag, harder and faster, a near SEIZURE: ROAD
          RAGE.
          
          He collapses in a heap.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Dude.
          
                              LUKE
                    It was goin' great. She's amazing.
                    Funny. And really smart.    And the
                    way she eats ravioli, like 'aah.'
          
                              KEENAN
                    Cool.
          
                                                                  16.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Then I started feelin' all weird
                    again, and,... oh, man, you'll
                    think I'm nuts... Keen, I had
                    breasts. I felt 'em.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Whoa, first date.     Definitely the
                    'new Luke!'
          
                                 LUKE
                    No!     On me.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You're startin' to creep me out.
                    Listen, I think I know what's goin'
                    on, okay? "Acute Adolescent
                    Anxiety." It's from the stress of
                    college, girls, grades. It's
                    really common.
          
                              LUKE
                    I'm not an adolescent.    Where'd you
                    get this crap?!
          
                              KEENAN
                    The Net. I found all the symptoms
                    right off: panic attacks,
                    "Localized Alopecia" -that's hair
                    loss. This doctor wrote back, "Any
                    chance your friend, Luke, just lost
                    his virginity?"
          
                              LUKE
                    You told, -you gave him my name?!
          
                              KEENAN
                    He's a doctor, back East. He's
                    sending this information pack.
                    Look, I started thinkin' you're
                    goin' bipolar on me or somethin'.
                    Come on, man, BREASTS?!
          
          Luke considers.
          
          
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING
          Luke hops down from the truck cab, fixes his shirt and hair,
          trying to look nonchalant as he rings the doorbell.
          
          Hearing something behind him, he turns as Max PUNCHES him in
          the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.
          
                                                          17.
          
          
          
                              MAX
                    You son-of-a-bitch, stay the hell
                    away from my sister!
          
          Luke GASPS for air.
          
                              MAX (CONT'D)
                    You don't say a word?! You just
                    leave her sittin' there?!
          
                              LUKE
                    I came to apologize.
          
          Max shoves him across the yard.
          
                              MAX
                    Get out a' here!   She's not home,
                    anyway.
          
                              LUKE
                    Will you tell her I came by?
          
                              MAX
                    No. She's honest with you, so you
                    bolt? And then what, you wake up
                    feelin' sorry for her?
          
                              LUKE
                    No! Is that what she thinks?   I
                    left 'cause a' what she said?
                    That's crazy! She's like the most
                    incredible girl I ever met!
          
          Max sneers, skeptical.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I had this 'pasta quattro funghi' -
                    four mushroom. It took me a while
                    to even figure it out, but I think
                    someone put shrooms in it, or
                    somehow they got in there by
                    mistake. I was hallucinating and
                    everything.
          
                              MAX
                    Amazes even me, a guy's capacity to
                    be a world-class asshole.
                    Fortunately, I'm familiar with the
                    cause.
          
                                                          18.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Will you please just tell her I
                    came by? Forget it. I'll catch up
                    with her on my own.
          
                                MAX
                    No.    You won't.
          
                              LUKE
                    Look, I'm gonna' see her again, -if
                    she'll see me. I don't care what
                    the fuck you say about it.
          
                              MAX
                    Oh, really?
          
          They face off.
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah, really.
          
                              MAX
                    You get near her, I'll feed your
                    nuts to the neighbor's dog!
          
                              LUKE
                    What kind a' dog is it?
          
                                MAX
                    Huh?
          
                              LUKE
                    I mean, is it a pitbull, or what?
          
          Caught off guard, a smile escapes Max.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I'm crazy about her.
          
                              MAX
                    Shrooms, huh?
          
          Luke nods 'yes.'
          
                              MAX (CONT'D)
                    I'll tell her you came by.
          
          Luke nods, appreciative.
          
                                                                     19.
          
          
          
          EXT. MUDDY WATERS' MINI-MART - NIGHT
          
          A tanker truck QUAKES past. Surrounded by fir trees, the
          eerily empty mini-mart glows with fluorescent junk food.
          
          INSIDE MINI-MART
          
          Luke stands behind the cash register, leafing through "The
          Outdoors Man."
          
          The CHIME BINGS and SYDNEY enters, early thirties, elegant in
          thrift-store chic. She's cool and in control, ...at least on
          the outside.
          
          She surveys random candy bars, stealing glances at Luke.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Had a sudden intense craving for a
                    cherry popsicle.
          
                              LUKE
                    You can check in that freezer.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    What a relief. I'm Sydney.    You?
          
                                 LUKE
                    Luke.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Workin' late, huh?   Luke?
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah, four AM. It sucks.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Sometimes you guys are just
                    unfathomably stupid.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Excuse me?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Why in the world do guys say "it
                    sucks" as if it were a bad thing?
                    I mean, every guy's dying to get a
                    blow job, right? So, you think
                    they'd treat those words with
                    profound respect, like holy
                    scripture. "What an unbelievable
                    sunset, honey: doesn't it just
                    SUCK?,"... "You won an Olympic Gold
                    Medal?!, that BLOWS!"
          
                                                                  20.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    I guess you're right.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    It must be great at your age. That
                    river of testosterone coursing
                    through your veins, the damn about
                    to burst! How about we just lock
                    this place up and go for an Olympic
                    Gold?
          
                                 LUKE
                    No thanks.     Jeez, lady.
          
          Disappointed, she checks her reflection in the freezer door.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I ought to dye my hair.      Don't you
                    think?
          
                              LUKE
                    Uh, I don't know.    Looks fine.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Your hair is such an incredible
                    color.
          
                              LUKE
                    It's brown.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I love it. Do you think I could
                    cut just a little piece? Match the
                    color? It really "sucks."
          
                              LUKE
                    Nah, c'mon. You're messin' with
                    me.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I'm not. I love it. You really
                    should get rid a' that thing,
                    anyway. I have clippers in my bag.
          
                              LUKE
                    What thing?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Cowlick. Right here.     See?   I can
                    just snip it off.
          
          She SNIPS his hair.    Luke pulls away.
          
                                                                     21.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Hey.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    What's the matter? Don't you like
                    being touched? Don't you like
                    being a guy?
          
                              LUKE
                    No. I mean,... What?      Sorry, but
                    you're just bizarre.
          
          She CHUCKLES, lays money on the counter.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    May be. But I learned long ago,
                    you can't change your true nature,
                    even if it can change you.
          
          As she leaves, she takes a provocative bite of the popsicle.
          
          
          EXT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DUSK
          
          Acres of yellowing corn surround a dilapidated farmhouse
          converted into a pool hall. The windows glow from warm
          lights inside.
          
          Parked along the gravel driveway are pickup trucks, cars, and
          Luke's Semi.
          
          INSIDE POOL HALL
          
          Smoke, ROWDY MUSIC and the CLACK of cue balls.
          
          Keenan and Luke snake their way through the pool tables.
          
                              LUKE
                    Holy shit. It's that lady from the
                    store! Grey and black at the bar.
          
          Keenan looks over at Sydney, finishing off a bourbon.
          
          RENTAL COUNTER
          
          Janine and Michelle check out a rack of billiard balls from
          the worldly British owner, POLLY.
          
          She runs the place like a wild west saloon, with such ease
          and confidence, it suggests there may be a shotgun under the
          bar.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
          
                                 POLLY
                       That boy, Keenan, still giving you
                       trouble?
          
                                 JANINE
                       Actually, I tried exactly what you
                       said.
          
                                 POLLY
                       And...?
          
                                 JANINE
                       Unbelievable! Thanks.
          
                                 POLLY
                       Works every time.
                           (to Michelle)
                       Nice to meet you, darling. I hope
                       you'll find not too many rules
                       here, and the drinks not too dear.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Yeah, thanks. It's amazing.
          
          Polly moves off.
          
                                 JANINE
                       Isn't she great? Guys drive across
                       the state just to buy a beer from
                       her. Total loner, though.    No
                       one's ever seen her with anyone.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       What did she tell you to try?
          
          Janine whispers in her ear.
          
          Michelle's jaw drops open, scandalized.
          
          They LAUGH.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Luke hands his keys to JEREMY, the handsome bartender, in
          exchange for a full pitcher of beer.
          
                                 LUKE
                       Thanks, man.
          
                                 KEENAN
                       Oh, God. She's eyeing you.    I
                       think she's comin' over.
          
                                                            23.
          
          
          
          Sydney saunters up.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Can I buy you a drink?
          
                              LUKE
                    Uh, no thanks. We're already here
                    with dates and stuff.
          
                                SYDNEY
                    You are?    Who? Where is she?
          
                              KEENAN
                    They're around somehwere.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Luke, if you like this girl, we
                    better talk.
          
                                LUKE
                    What?
          
          Sydney glances around, talks quietly.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Anything happen since we last
                    spoke? Hot flashes? Pressure in
                    your chest?
          
          Luke pales.
          
                                LUKE
                    No.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Who are you?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Dr. Sydney Catchadourian.     Keenan,
                    right?
          
                              LUKE
                    You know him?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    We exchanged E-mail.    I came right
                    away.
          
          Luke gives Keenan the evil eye.
          
                              KEENAN
                    From Philadelphia?   Why?
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Your friend here has an extra
                       chromosome.
          
          The little remaining color in Luke's face now drains away.
          He shakes his head 'no.'
          
                                 LUKE
                       Someone put mushrooms in my
                       mushroom sauce.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       I tested your hair.
          
                                 LUKE
                       You're like some whack job.   Get
                       the hell away from me.
          
          Luke moves off, sloshing beer.     Sydney sighs.
          
                                  SYDNEY
                       Denial, denial, denial. Always the
                       first step. Keep him away from
                       that girl.
          
                                 KEENAN
                       What're you talkin' about?
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Chromosomes. Most people have
                       forty-six: Two X if you're a girl,
                       an X and Y if you're a guy. He's
                       got forty seven: An X, a Y, and a
                       Z.
          
          POOL TABLE
          
          Janine and Michelle select pool cues.
          
                                 JANINE
                       We've only been together six
                       months. And he's such a guy's guy,
                       everyone's buddy, but, alcoholic
                       parents, six months in "Juvey."
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Wild past, huh?
          
                                                                  25.
          
          
          
                                 JANINE
                       I think the only reason he's even
                       alive right now, is okay, partly
                       'cause he's so damn smart, but
                       mostly 'cause there's this one
                       person, he knows, absolutely, no
                       matter what, won't bale on him.
          
                                  MICHELLE
                       You.
          
                                JANINE
                       No. He doesn't trust me at all.
                       Luke. He's a rock.
          
                                  MICHELLE
                       Yeah?
          
                                 JANINE
                       So, yes, you can trust him. I'm
                       hoping Keenan's the same way.
                       'Cause believe me, I'm not used to
                       rocks, I'm used to pebbles.
          
          Michelle LAUGHS.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Grains of sand.
          
          Luke rejoins them with the pitcher of beer, glancing back
          toward the bar. Keenan comes too, with a look of concern.
          
                                 JANINE
                       Everything okay?
          
                                  KEENAN
                       Sure.   I need a drink.
          
          Keenan steals glances at Luke, trying to sort it all out.
          
                                 KEENAN (CONT'D)
                           (aside to Luke)
                       That lady's nuts.
          
          Luke nods.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Sydney sits at a bar stool, keeping an eye on Luke and
          Michelle. Jeremy lays out a cocktail napkin, speaks with a
          slight Texas drawl.
          
                                                                  26.
          
          
          
                              JEREMY
                    Another round?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Please. You see that couple over
                    there? I don't get it. What's he
                    see in her?
          
                              JEREMY
                    The brunette? You kiddin'? I'd
                    give my left one to be with her.
          
                               SYDNEY
                    Yeah?   So could he.
          
          POOL TABLE - LATER
          
          Now alone with Michelle, Luke lines up his cue stick, then
          catches Michelle's admiring eyes.
          
          She smiles, glances over at Keenan and Janine, making out by
          the jukebox.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Your friends sorta' like each
                    other, huh?
          
                              LUKE
                    Super-glue. Thirty seconds
                    together, you can't pull 'em apart.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    How'd they meet?
          
                              LUKE
                    Keenan sold her a bike. I don't
                    think they've been apart more than
                    six hours since.
          
          Luke peers over the corner pocket, and watches Michelle shoot
          and sink the ball.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I never thought in a million years
                    you'd go out with me, let alone
                    twice.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    You're not s'posed to say that.
                    That's a total pathetic, loser
                    thing to say. But I'm gonna' take
                    it as a huge compliment.
          
                                                                  27.
                                 MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                       Okay, two word answers only. Why'd
                       you ask me out in the first place?
          
                                 LUKE
                       Beautiful. Unpretentious.     Why'd
                       you say 'yes?'
          
                                  MICHELLE
                       Gentle.
          
          Luke sneers, not his favorite compliment.
          
                                  MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                       ...Hot.   Deep.   Three words.
          
          He smiles.
          
                                 LUKE
                       Okay, two words. What're you most
                       passionate about?
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Friendship. Trust.     You?
          
                                  LUKE
                       Hockey.   ...Hockey.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       So much for "deep."
          
          They LAUGH.
          
                                  LUKE
                       You.
          
          The electricity between them charges the air.
          
          Luke maneuvers himself closer.
          
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                       Okay, I'm gonna' take a wild shot.
                       Ricochet off the back, over here,
                       then straight into that side
                       pocket. What are my chances?
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Point zero zero zero one.
          
          Luke takes his shot,...
          
          and KISSES HER.
          
          The ball ricochets off the back, across the table, and sinks
          in the pocket at the side.
          
                                                                        28.
          
          
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Jeremy looks on, aroused.        Sydney squints, dismayed, barely
          able to watch.
          
                                JEREMY
                       Damn. Will you look at that tonsil
                       hockey?
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       I'd prefer not. This could get
                       bad.
          
                                 JEREMY
                       You've been staring at him all
                       night. You got a thing for him, or
                       what?
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Actually, I'm hoping he's got one
                       for me.
          
          POOL TABLE
          
          Keenan and Janine rejoin Luke and Michelle, all four elated.
          
                                 KEENAN
                       Looks like you two are gettin' on
                       okay. Should we rack up another
                       game?
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Definitely! I'd like to get good
                       at this pool thing.
          
          Luke racks up the balls as Michelle lines up the cue.
          
                                 MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                       Okay, I'm gonna' break this wide
                       open!
          
                                    LUKE
                       Go for it!
          
          Before Keenan has lifted the wooden triangle rack,
          
          Michelle HAMMERS the cue ball.
          
          It CRACKS off the rack,
          
          ROCKETS off the table,...
          
          and CANNONBALLS Luke in the CROTCH.
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
          
          Keenan, Michelle, and Janine ALL GASP.
          
          They CRINGE, poised, waiting for Luke to react.
          
                                   MICHELLE
                       God.    Sorry.
          
          Luke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the
          table.
          
          He sees them watching him.
          
                                   LUKE
                       What?
          
                                 KEENAN
                       Man, I'd be on the floor cryin'
                       like a baby.
          
                                 LUKE
                       No, I'm all right.
          
          Surprised, they return to the game.
          
          Michelle lines up the cue ball again, as Luke considers,...
          
          with a slow-dawning realization that something, somehow, just
          isn't right.
          
          He casually touches his hand to his pants.
          
          He pales slightly.
          
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                       Would you excuse me a sec'?
          
          He looks to Keenan for help.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Sydney watches as Keenan and Luke cross the hall toward the
          back.
          
          She flags Jeremy.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Jeremy! Bourbon. Fast!
                           (a glance at Luke)
                       Better give me the whole bottle.
          
                                                                  30.
          
          
          
          OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM
          
          Luke tries the men's room door, locked.
          
                                 KEENAN
                    In here.
          
          Keenan opens another door that leads them into a store room.
          Luke follows, with a look of concern.
          
          INSIDE STORE ROOM
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    I mean, it was like a precision-
                    guided missile.
          
          Luke unzips and gently digs in his trousers.
          
          He looks down, SHUDDERS,...
          
                                 LUKE
                    Uh- ah-
          
          Luke's face CONTORTS, terrified.
          
                              KEENAN
                    I'll get some ice.
          
          Luke shakes his head "no," points toward his crotch, GASPS,
          barely able to make a sound...
          
                                 LUKE
                    It's-!     Look!
          
          Keenan gives him a look, repelled, perplexed...
          
                                 KEENAN
                    What?
          
          then takes a look,...
          
          His EYES GET HUGE.
          
                                 KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    DUDE!!!
          
          Sydney BURSTS in with the bottle of bourbon.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I was afraid a' this!
                        (to Keenan)
                    Make sure no one gets in!
          
                                                                   31.
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                        (to Luke)
                    Now, will you listen to me?!
          
          Luke, slack-jawed, keeps checking himself.   Each time the
          horror of it grows more intense.
          
                               LUKE
                    Oh, GOD!
          
          Sydney uncaps the bourbon and drops capsules in from a
          prescription bottle.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    It's gonna' come back.    Drink this!
          
                              LUKE
                    What're you givin' me?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Valium. Flexeril. And a shitload
                    of Darvon. You gotta' calm down.
          
                              LUKE
                    "Caaalm Down?!!!!!!"
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Here we go...
          
          He and Sydney have to yell to hear over Luke's escalating
          MANTRA...
          
                              LUKE
                    "CAAALM DOWN?!!!"
          
                              KEENAN
                    What's wrong with him?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    He's a Zerophiliac.
          
                              KEENAN
                    A what?! I'm gettin' a doctor!
                    This isn't right!
          
          Sydney GRABS Keenan, SHOVES him against the wall.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I am a doctor! You breathe one
                    word, anyone else sees him like
                    this, and he's fucked! Pictures
                    all over the net, tabloids,
                    television!
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    TELE-VISION?!!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    No!  We're gonna' get it back!
                        (to Keenan)
                    You let me help him, he gets a
                    normal body, lives a normal life.
                    Now, you his friend or not?!
          
          Keenan nods that 'yes, he is.'     Sydney releases him.
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Hang onto him. So he doesn't get
                    hurt when he passes out.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Now just wait a sec'?     Is it
                    CONTAGIOUS?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    There are no recorded incidents of
                    transmission from physical contact.
          
                              KEENAN
                    "Recorded incidents?!!"
          
                              LUKE
                    Oh, PLEASE God!     What did I DO
                    WRONG?!
          
                               SYDNEY
                    Nothing.   You're a Z.
          
                              KEENAN
                    "RECORDED INCIDENTS?!"     Oh my God,
                    I used his deodorant!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Oh, will you calm down?
          
                               KEENAN
                    "C A L M    D O W N ?!!!"
          
                               LUKE
                    "C A L M    D O W N ?!!!"
          
          Luke's eyes glaze over...
          
          He weaves, losing his balance...
          
                               SYDNEY
                    Finally.
          
                                                                    33.
          
          
          
          Sydney helps Luke FLOP DOWN on the floor.    He passes out.
          
                               SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    He'll be alright. He didn't go all
                    the way. When you fall asleep or
                    pass out, a Z almost always reverts
                    back. It's called a Nocturnal
                    Remission.
          
          Keenan approaches Luke, then steps back.
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, relax, it's not contagious.
          
          Keenan grabs the bourbon-Darvon concoction from Sydney, wipes
          the rim of the bottle just in case, then takes a big swig.
          
          
          INT. SYDNEY'S BED & BREAKFAST - LATE NIGHT
          
          On a corner table sits high-tech laboratory equipment.
          
          Keenan and Luke gulp beers, still in shock.   Luke keeps one
          hand down his pants for reassurance.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    In the world?   A hundred. A
                    thousand. There's no way to know.
                    It doesn't show up in any normal
                    DNA test. It's triggered when you
                    first have sex.
          
                              LUKE
                    The woman in the RV!
          
                                 KEENAN
                        (dark)
                    From Utah.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Now, you're Morphescent whenever
                    you're aroused.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You tellin' me this is gonna'
                    happen any time he gets the hots
                    for a girl?
          
          Keenan looks over at Luke...
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Man, this could be a problem.
          
                                                           34.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Is there a cure?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    It's not a disease!    But there are
                    steps you can take.
          
                              LUKE
                    Well, what are they?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Take it easy. You can't rush this.
                    Before anything, you need to try
                    going all the way.
          
                              KEENAN
                    "All the way?"
          
                              SYDNEY
                    You need to turn all the way into a
                    female.
          
                              LUKE
                    You out of your mind?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    You have to give it a try.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Maybe we should get a second
                    opinion.
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah, may be! 'Cause you can
                    FORGET THAT!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Fine, but I warn you, they've never
                    seen this before. First, they'll
                    try a barrage of antipsychotic
                    medications, surgery, electroshock
                    therapy, -god knows what.
          
                              KEENAN
                    If he were to try goin' all the
                    way, then what?
          
          Luke glares at him.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm just askin'.
          
                                                                35.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    It ain't gonna' happen!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Oh, for Chris' sake! I'm trying to
                    help you. That Z chromosome's not
                    latent anymore! You don't get
                    control a' that thing, you don't
                    know when it's going to kick in,
                    what it's gonna' do! You want to
                    end up with three left breasts,
                    behemoth hips and one testicle?!
          
          Luke and Keenan swallow, wide-eyed at the prospect.
          
          Sydney calms herself down.
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Now, there's no reason for that to
                    happen. Sorry. You're not the
                    only one who didn't get any sleep.
                    Now, are you going to let me help,
                    or not?
          
                              KEENAN
                    How would he even do that?   Go all
                    the way, I mean?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    He's a Z.
                        (to Luke)
                    You become Morphescent when you get
                    turned on. You can change all the
                    way when you have an orgasm.
          
                                LUKE
                    With who?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I'm available.
          
                                LUKE
                    No way!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Well, excuse me. Truth is, at this
                    stage, you don't really need anyone
                    else.
          
                                LUKE
                    Huh?
          
                                                                 36.
          
          
          
          Sydney wearily sips a highball. She looks to Keenan for
          help. Keenan flashes the international sign for jacking off.
          
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                    Oh.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    It's a lot to absorb, I know. When
                    you're ready, give me a call. Your
                    first time, you shouldn't be alone.
          
          
          EXT. CEMETERY - DAWN
          
          A deserted, hilltop cemetery. Luke sits on the manicured
          lawn, across from a gravestone with vestigial images of
          brightly colored smiley-faces and fish.
          
                              LUKE
                    Michelle. And I really like her,
                    dad. But,...
          
          He bounces a soccer ball against the headstone.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    You know, I always thought your
                    dying was the worst thing that ever
                    happened to me, and that happened
                    more to you than it did to me... I
                    mean, a lot more, really.
          
          Luke paces nervously.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    Look, every day I wish you were
                    around, but I swear, if I tell you
                    this, you damn well better stay
                    dead!
          
          He glances at a burial ceremony, half-mile away.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    And I swear to God I'm gonna' beat
                    this thing. No matter what it
                    takes. Before I tell you, I just
                    want to make sure you know that,
                    okay?
          
          A hushed voice...
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I think I might be a Zerophiliac.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
          
          EXT. LUMBER MILL
          
          Keenan and Luke spar on roller blades, hockey sticks in hand.
          Luke WHACKS the hockey puck with such intensity, it may land
          on Mars.
          
                              LUKE
                    I'm not doin' it. I don't care
                    what she says! I can control this
                    thing.
          
                                KEENAN
                    How?
          
                              LUKE
                    I didn't know what was goin' on
                    before. I do now, so, it's not
                    gonna' be a problem. I just need
                    to stay focused!
          
                              KEENAN
                    You mean, keep yourself from
                    getting turned on? How're you
                    gonna' do that? You get turned on
                    by two scoops of ice cream.
          
          Luke glares at him.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm just sayin'. I mean, you think
                    Larissa, the horse-faced girl's got
                    her good points.
          
          Michelle and Janine ride up on their bikes.
          
                              JANINE
                    I knew we'd find 'em here.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    We just wanted to know if you're
                    alright. After last night.
          
                                LUKE
                    Yeah.    I'm fine.   Thanks.   Perfect.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Good.
                        (slightly suggestive)
                    Good.
          
          Luke smiles, his face REDDENS.
          
                                                                    38.
          
          
          
                                MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                      I had a really good.
          
                                 LUKE
                      Me too.
          
          Luke smiles, nods, followed by a look of PANIC.
          
                                LUKE (CONT'D)
                      Will you excuse me a sec'?
          
          He ducks away.
          
                                JANINE
                      What is goin' on?!
          
                                KEENAN
                      We just need to be alone.   We got
                      a big game tomorrow. Sometimes
                      guys just need to hang with the
                      guys, you know? No distractions?
          
          Janine gives him a look of "What the hell are you talkin'
          about?"
          
          Keenan stares back, PLEADING.
          
          Janine relents, despite herself.
          
                                JANINE
                      C'mon, Michelle. Let the boys play
                      with their pucks.
          
          BEHIND STACKS OF LUMBER
          
          Luke leans against the logs, wipes sweat from his brow, and
          realizes...
          
          SOMETHING'S HAPPENING AGAIN.
          
          Panicked, he grabs his crotch, feels it,
          
          Everything's normal.
          
          Or is it?
          
          He frantically unbuttons his shirt and peers inside,...
          
          He slumps back against the logs,
          
          WAVES OF RELIEF.
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          
          INT. LUKE'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Luke storms through the house, trying to evade Janine, who
          enthusiastically follows. Keenan traipses after.
          
                              LUKE
                    You TOLD HER?!
          
                              KEENAN
                    I had to. You know Janine.   She
                    knew somethin' was up.
          
                              JANINE
                    I've read about this kinda' thing,
                    but I didn't think it was real.
                    It's so cool!
          
                              LUKE
                    It's disgusting!
          
                              JANINE
                    How can you say that? If I had a
                    chance to be a guy for a day, I'd
                    jump at it. Seriously, Keen,
                    wouldn't you want to get inside a
                    girl's body?
          
          Realizing she just handed him the perfect straight line...
          
                              JANINE (CONT'D)
                    Don't EVEN go there!
                        (rolling her eyes)
                    Fine. You're boys. Still, isn't
                    it every guy's dream to have a pair
                    of boobs to play with anytime he
                    wants?
          
                              LUKE
                    Not my own!
                        (to Keenan)
                    Man, how could you tell her?!
          
                              KEENAN
                    She should be here. It's just
                    weird, two guys alone, one turnin'
                    into a girl.
          
                              JANINE
                    Yeah, I can't wait. Not exactly
                    something you get to see every day.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Forget it!
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          
                              JANINE
                    What, HE gets to, and I don't!
          
                              LUKE
                    No one gets to!
          
          Luke goes in the bedroom, SLAMS the door.
          
          Keenan and Janine take up residence outside.
          
          Janine tries to peek through the keyhole, beneath the door.
          
                              JANINE
                    Should we put on some soft music?
          
                              KEENAN
                    You want a magazine in there?
          
                                LUKE (O.S.)
                    Shut up!
          
          LATER
          
          Janine keeps an ear held close against the door.
          
                              KEENAN
                    How 'bout a couple beers?
          
                              JANINE
                    Maybe you want to take a bath?
          
                              LUKE (O.S.)
                    Will you PLEASE shut up?!
          
                              JANINE
                    Does he sound different?
          
                                KEENAN
                    Think so.
          
                               LUKE (O.S.)
                    Oh God!
                        (lewd)
                    Oh, my God!
                        (rising in pitch)
                    Oh my GAWD!
          
          Keenan and Janine exchange a worried look.
          
                                                                   41.
          
          
          
          INSIDE THE BEDROOM
          
          Now approaching the mirror, in awe, ...gently raising a hand
          to touch the exquisite FEMALE FACE reflected there, stands a
          real female, an absolutely FEMALE LUKE.
          
          OUTSIDE THE DOOR
          
          Janine knocks.
          
                                JANINE
                    Luke?    You alright?
          
          The door opens, revealing Female Luke, wrapped in a sheet.
          
          Keenan clutches Janine.
          
          They STARE, AT A TOTAL LOSS, INCREDULOUS...
          
                                KEENAN
                    Whoa.
          
                                JANINE
                    Dude.
          
          Female Luke speaks, with an unmistakably female voice.
          
                              FEMALE LUKE
                    Happened fast, huh?
          
                              JANINE
                    Can we see?
          
          Female Luke hesitates.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Come on. It's not like I haven't
                    seen you naked a hundred times.
                    And she's a girl!
          
          Female Luke shyly parts the sheet, revealing her stunning
          naked torso.
          
                                KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Whoa.
          
                              JANINE
                    Dude.
                        (exasperated)
                    Of course they're perfect. I
                    couldn't have tits like that?
          
          Female Luke checks herself out in the mirror.
          
                                                                    42.
          
          
          
                                 FEMALE LUKE
                    Oh, God.     Look at me.
          
          Keenan and Janine sit on the edge of the bed, in shock.
          
                              FEMALE LUKE (CONT'D)
                    What's the matter?
          
          Keenan, afraid to answer, looks to Janine.
          
          They both have the same reaction...
          
                              JANINE
                    You're really hot.    Victoria's
                    Secret hot.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Sports Illustrated Swimsuit
                    edition.
          
                              JANINE
                    Latvian Lesbians' Hidden Camera
                    Chronicles.
                        (to Keenan)
                    Don't look at me, -it's your tape.
          
          Keenan keeps his distance from Luke, embarrassed, if turned
          on.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Look, I just wanna' get one thing
                    straight. No way I'm gonna' sleep
                    with you.
          
                              FEMALE LUKE
                    Man, even as a joke, that's just
                    SICK!
          
                              JANINE
                    I will. I'm definitely not into
                    the butch hair thing, though.   You
                    gotta' do something about that.
          
          Keenan looks at her shocked.
          
                              JANINE (CONT'D)
                    I thought you're into watchin' two
                    girls?
          
          Keenan's speechless.
          
          Female Luke can't stop gazing at herself in the mirror.
          
                                                                     43.
          
          
          
                              FEMALE LUKE
                    This is too weird. This is
                    freaking me out.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Should we call Dr. Catchadourian?
          
                              FEMALE LUKE
                    What for? I did it. Now, I can
                    switch back. Get outta' here.
          
                                 JANINE
                    Already?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Yeah, okay, yeah.
          
                              JANINE
                    Will you stop starin'?!
          
          Janine rolls her eyes, as she and Keenan back out of the
          room, their eyes locked on her amazing body.
          
          
          OUTSIDE BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Janine and Keenan are sprawled on the nearby couch.
          
          Luca opens the door.
          
                              FEMALE LUKE
                    Janine? It's like I can't get in
                    the right mood or something.
          
                              JANINE
                    Welcome to my world. Oh, honey, no
                    one could in this situation.
          
                               FEMALE LUKE
                    You gotta' help. I need to do this
                    right now!
          
                              JANINE
                    You can't force these things.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Some girls go half their lives
                    before they even have one.
          
                              JANINE
                    Okay, Studly, what do you suggest?
          
                                                                       44.
          
          
          
                                 KEENAN
                       She likes it when I tell her stuff.
          
                                    JANINE
                       Like what?
          
                                 KEENAN
                       "You're so beautiful,"
                       "I love your smile,"
                       "The English Patient was my
                       favorite movie too."
          
          Janine and Female Luke both roll their eyes.       Female Luke
          swings the door shut.
          
          The DOORBELL CHIMES.
          
                                 FEMALE LUKE (O.S.)
                       Who's that?!
          
                                  KEENAN
                       Pizza!   Figured you'll want some
                       after.
          
          FRONT DOOR
          
          Janine throws it open, Max stands outside.
          
                                    MAX
                       Hey.
          
                                 JANINE
                       Can I help you?
          
                                 MAX
                       I was lookin' for Luke.
          
                                 KEENAN
                       Hey, man. He's not around right
                       now. What's up?
          
          Female Luke comes out of the bedroom, wrapped in a sheet.
          
                                    FEMALE LUKE
                       Thank God.     I'm starving!
          
          She stops in her tracks, stares at Max.
          
          Max stares back, intrigued.
          
                                 MAX
                       How ya' doin'?
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          
          Female Luke nods 'okay.'
          
                                MAX (CONT'D)
                    I'm Max.    You live here too?
          
          Janine, Keenan, and Female Luke are momentarily speechless.
          
                               JANINE
                    No.   She's just visiting.
          
                              KEENAN
                    She's Luke's cousin.
          
                                JANINE
                    Luca.
          
          Keenan and Luca GLARE at Janine.
          
          Max gazes at Luca, spellbound.
          
                              MAX
                    I always thought "Luca" was a guy's
                    name? Italian or something.
          
          Luca wraps herself more tightly in the sheet.
          
                              LUCA
                    I'm part Italian.
          
                              MAX
                    Cool. I'm part Italian too. The
                    important part.
                        (perfect Italian)
                    Lei sono una bella donna. Amerei
                    per mostrarlo il che inclinando
                    torre di pisa.
          
                              LUCA
                    What's that mean?
          
          His eyes fixed on Luca, he smiles.
          
                              MAX
                    You in town for a while?
          
                              JANINE
                    No, just a few weeks.
          
                                LUCA
                    'Weeks?!'
          
                                KEENAN
                    Days.
          
                                                                   46.
          
          
          
                              LUCA
                    I'm leaving today!    Now!
          
                               KEENAN
                    Is there anything you want me to
                    tell Luke?
          
          Max gets fluid, scanning the room for a toehold, infatuated
          by Luca. He seizes on a hockey stick.
          
                              MAX
                    I'm way into hockey. I was hopin'
                    Luke could show me the ropes. Is
                    he as awesome as I've heard?
          
                                 LUCA
                    Yeah.     He's alright.
          
                              MAX
                    Do you play?
          
                              LUCA
                    Uh, I don't know.
          
                              JANINE
                    She's gotta' pack.    You need to go.
          
                              MAX
                    Really nice meeting you.
          
          Janine ushers Max out the door and shuts it on him.
          
          Luca ducks into the bedroom, shuts the door.
          
          INSIDE BEDROOM
          
          Luca at the window, peers out between the curtains, watching,
          as Max walks away.
          
          OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
          
          As Max gets to the end of the driveway, he stops and turns
          back, sporting a charming smile.
          
          INSIDE THE BEDROOM
          
          Luca jumps away from the window, smacking into Janine.
          
                              JANINE
                    Are you okay?
          
          Luca just stares back at her, nonplussed.
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          
                              JANINE (CONT'D)
                    What is it? What's
                    the matter?
                        (beginning to get it)
                    Oh...
          
                                 LUCA
                    "Oh" what?     What do you mean, "oh?"
          
                              JANINE
                        (shrugs)
                    He's a hunk.
          
                              LUCA
                    I got to switch back.    Right now!
          
                              JANINE
                    What's the big deal?
          
                              LUCA
                    Get out of here!     Just GET OUT!
          
                              JANINE
                    Okay, okay.
          
          OUTSIDE BEDROOM
          
          Janine emerges from the bedroom to join Keenan.    He looks up
          at her, questioning.
          
                              KEENAN
                    What's goin' on?
          
                              JANINE
                    It's a girl thing.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Does he need any help in there?
          
                              JANINE
                    Not from you.
          
          
          OUTSIDE BEDROOM DOOR - LATER
          
          Keenan and Janine sprawled out, leaning against the door,
          half-eaten pizza between them on the floor, WEARY.
          
          BUZZING emanates from inside the bedroom.
          
                              LUCA (O.S.)
                    This is good!
          
                                                            48.
          
          
          
          Keenan and Janine PERK UP.
          
                                KEENAN
                    Finally.
          
                              JANINE
                    Alright, okay, now open those
                    little levers on the sides,... and
                    flip that center thingy back...
          
          Keenan finds this particularly unsettling.
          
                              LUCA (O.S.)
                        (enthused)
                    Did you get this thing at the mall?
          
                                JANINE
                    No.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Janine wouldn't have one a' those.
          
                              JANINE
                    Please. And mine's got way more
                    features than that one.
                        (Keenan's crotch)
                    Or that one.
          
          Keenan gives her the evil eye.
          
                              LUCA (O.S.)
                    So, where'd you get it?
          
                              JANINE
                    It was Larissa's.    My roommate.
          
          Inside the bedroom, the BUZZING STOPS.
          
                                LUCA (O.S.)
                    GROSSS!!!
          
          OUTSIDE DOOR
          
          Keenan grabs the last bottle from his six-pack.
          
                              KEENAN
                    I'm just sayin', he's not that
                    experienced with girls.
          
                              JANINE
                    Oh, and you are?
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    I'm startin' to wonder if you are?
          
                              JANINE
                    I'm not gonna' feed your fantasies.
          
          Keenan flips the TV remote, disturbed.
          
          INSIDE THE BEDROOM
          
          Luca sits on the edge of the bed, frustrated.
          
                                JANINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Luca?
          
                              LUCA
                    Don't call me that!
          
                              JANINE (O.S.)
                    You gotta' just think about
                    whatever turns you on. No matter
                    what it is.
          
          Luca considers, she goes over to the window, peers out
          momentarily, then draws back.
          
          OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM
          
          Janine lies down on the floor.
          
                              JANINE (CONT'D)
                        (last ditch)
                    Okay, pretend you're thrown on your
                    back, pinned against the bed...
          
          Spread eagle, eyes closed, she fantasizes, as she directs...
          
                              JANINE (CONT'D)
                    You can't move an arm, a leg,
                    nothing, even an inch!
          
          Keenan glances over, taken aback at her tone...
          
                               JANINE (CONT'D)
                    And two strong hands feel your
                    thighs,...
          
          Keenan watches, getting turned on...
          
                               JANINE (CONT'D)
                    creeping firmly, slowly toward your
                    breasts...
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          
          Keenan lunges for Janine.
          
                                JANINE (CONT'D)
                    Keen!
          
                              KEENAN
                    Babe, every time I look at you, I
                    get the shivers! I just want to
                    rip your clothes off, and throw you
                    down...
          
                                JANINE
                    Oh, Keen!
          
          They're kissing, ROLLING AROUND TOGETHER now,...
          
                              KEENAN
                    I want to envelop every inch of
                    you, that incredible curve along
                    your side,...
          
          They roll on the floor, clothes torn...
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    I want to pin your arms over your
                    head, and make mad, passionate...
          
                                LUCA (O.S.)
                    AAAHHH!
          
          Keenan and Janine RECOIL.
          
          Whether agony or ecstasy, it's a frightening sound.
          
          The door opens.
          
          Luke stands in his shorts, ALL MALE.
          
                              JANINE
                    You're a screamer.
          
          
          EXT. LANGFORD STATUARY SUPPLY - NIGHT
          
          Sydney makes her way through a barbed-wire fence, past a "No
          Trespassing" sign. A lone DOG HOWLS in the distance.
          
          Life-size replicas of Greek Gods, Venus and David, all face
          one way in the mist. Their cold stone bodies press up
          against each other; nude, indifferent.
          
          A figure peers out between the statues in a long black coat,
          a baseball cap over his eyes: Luke.
          
                                                           51.
          
          
          
                              SYDNEY
                    What are we doing here?
          
                              LUKE
                    Didn't want anyone around.   So, I
                    did what you said.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Amazing, huh?
          
                               LUKE
                    Weird.   Awful.
          
                             SYDNEY
                    Hmm. Was it difficult making the
                    switch?
          
                              LUKE
                    No. It was hard gettin' back.      I
                    need an owner's manual.
          
          Sydney smiles, nods in agreement.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    A lot of guys could use one of
                    those.
          
                               LUKE
                    So, what now? Do I take pills or
                    something?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    No, it doesn't work like that.
                    This may sound odd, but I need to
                    know if you're attracted to me.
          
                                   LUKE
                    What?    No.
          
                                SYDNEY
                    Hmm.    You're not gay, are you?
          
                              LUKE
                    NO! Jeez! I'm just not attracted
                    to you like that.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Okay, calm down. This could be a
                    problem. Right now, you can go
                    either way anytime you want. It's
                    a very special and critical time
                    for a Z, something you'll
                    experience only once in life.

                      LUKE
          Good.
          
                    SYDNEY
          You need to use this incredible
          opportunity you've been given, to
          figure out which you're supposed to
          be: male or female.
          
                      LUKE
          What?
          
                    SYDNEY
          Don't you see? You get to choose.
          
                    LUKE
          I don't want to choose.   I want to
          be a guy.
          
                    SYDNEY
          Yes, well, the thing is, sometimes
          your desires can conflict with your
          desires. It's important to know
          for sure.
          
                    LUKE
          Believe me, I know.
          
                    SYDNEY
          I think you need to try again.
          
                      LUKE
          No way!
          
                    SYDNEY
          Why're you so resistant? If the
          truth is, you want to be a guy,
          great, but if not...
          
                    LUKE
          Don't even say that!
          
                    SYDNEY
          Well, clearly some part of you
          feels differently. You couldn't
          change if you didn't want to.
          
                      LUKE
          What?!    That's crap!
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          
                              SYDNEY
                    That's the thing about the truth.
                    It'll set you free, but first it
                    can really piss you off.
          
          Sydney moves to leave.
          
                              LUKE
                    This is nuts! I'm supposed to be a
                    guy!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Then what's the problem?   You are
                    one.
          
          Sydney turns to leave.
          
                              LUKE
                    You're not gonna' help?!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I will, the moment you're ready to
                    try again. You can come back to my
                    place right now if you want.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Forget it!
          
          
          EXT. LUMBER MILL - DAY
          
          Bikes and SUV's outside the shut down mill.    Abandoned timber
          surrounds an asphalt clearing.
          
          Luke, Keenan, Chad, Jeremy, and OTHER GUYS in the midst of a
          friendly, if brutal roller hockey game.
          
          Luke glances over and spots Max high up on a pile of logs,
          cheering them on.
          
          Jeremy passes the puck off to Luke who drives it MANIACALLY
          to score the winning GOAL.
          
          The Guys CHEER.
          
                              CHAD
                    Well, ain't we a basket a'
                    biscuits?
          
                              JEREMY
                    Yeah, Luke, what got into you
                    today?
          
                                                                  54.
          
          
          
                                    LUKE
                    The Force.
          
          AFTER THE GAME
          
          The guys gather up their belongings near the cars.
          
          Luke sits on the running board of his truck, unlacing his
          skates.
          
          Max comes over.
          
                                MAX
                    Hey.    Good game.
          
                                    LUKE
                    Yeah.
          
                              MAX
                    I dropped by your place. Any chance
                    you could give me a few pointers.
          
                                    LUKE
                    Me?
          
                              MAX
                    You're awesome out there. And
                    according to my sister, you walk on
                    water.
          
          Luke grunts, a smile.
          
                              MAX (CONT'D)
                    Truth is, I uh, met your cousin.
                    Luca.
          
                                    LUKE
                    Oh.     Yeah?
          
                              MAX
                    You both have practically the same
                    name?
          
                              LUKE
                    We were both named after our Uncle.
                    Locasto.
          
                              MAX
                    Well, she's cool. Actually, she's
                    hot. I was hopin' maybe you could
                    hook me up.
          
                                                                   55.
          
          
          
                                 LUKE
                    Huh?   No.    Not a chance.
          
                                 MAX
                    Boyfriend?
          
                              LUKE
                    No! She just wouldn't be
                    interested!
          
                              MAX
                    She a Lesbian?
          
                              LUKE
                    No! Of course not.     Jesus!   She's,
                    -my cousin!
          
                              MAX
                    Yeah, okay. So? Michelle's my
                    sister. You gonna' tell me you
                    wouldn't like to do her?!
          
                              LUKE
                    FUCK YOU, man!
          
          Luke SHOVES Max, who SHOVES him right back.
          
                              MAX
                    What is your deal?!
          
                              LUKE
                    You ASSHOLE!
          
          Luke lunges for him.
          
          They go at it, wrestling FIERCELY.
          
          Max gets the upper hand, and pins Luke down to the ground.
          
          Luke surges with RAGE, breaks free. Grit teeth, ripped
          clothes, they roll on top of each other, two rabid pitbulls.
          
          Keenan and the Other Guys rush in, pulling them apart.
          
                              MAX
                    Keep the fuck away from me!     And
                    Michelle too!
          
                              LUKE
                    You can fuck off!
          
                              CHAD
                    What the hell's goin' on?!
          
                                                                      56.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                        (to the guys)
                    Luke's datin' his sister.
          
                              VARIOUS GUYS
                        (recognition)
                    Aaaah!
          
                              LUKE
                    Oh, you can all fuck off!
          
          Luke breaks free of the guys, and moves off.
          
          
          INT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - DAWN
          
          Sydney stands at the bar with a cup of coffee, chatting with
          Jeremy.
          
                              JEREMY
                    This shirt? I've had it for years.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Well, it's very sexy. I love men's
                    clothes. What else have you got in
                    your closet?
          
          Jeremy smiles, unsure what she means. When Polly approaches,
          her eyes a little red, Jeremy pulls her aside.
          
                              JEREMY
                    Polly, are you alright?   Didn't
                    mean to walk in on you.
          
                             POLLY
                    Oh, hon. I'm fine, thanks. Love,
                    tears. That's the trade-off.
          
          She puts a hand to his cheek, reassuring.    Jeremy ducks
          behind the bar.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    My God, he's gorgeous.
          
                              POLLY
                    Yes, he's a Michelangelo. And the
                    sweetest boy in the world. Sorry,
                    darling, I'm afraid you'll find
                    he's not your type.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Oh, we'll see about that.
          
                                                                  57.
          
          
          
                              POLLY
                    I think he may prefer men.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I certainly hope so.
          
          Keenan and Janine enter.
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    You two better have a seat.
          
                              JANINE
                    Is Luke alright?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    He should have full control over
                    this now. Something must be really
                    confusing him. The only thing I
                    can think of...
          
                               KEENAN
                    What?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    When he became Luca, was he
                    attracted to one of you? You can
                    get really thrown by that. Janine?
          
                               JANINE
                    No.   Not me.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Well, he sure as hell wasn't
                    attracted to me.
          
                               JANINE
                    No.   Definitely not.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Wasn't it just the two of you?
          
                              JANINE
                    Not exactly.
          
          Janine glances to Keenan, as his eyes GO WIDE, grossed out.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Oh, give me a break! No way!
                    Max?! They just had a huge fight.
                    He tried to beat the crap out of
                    him!
          
          Janine and Sydney exchange a knowing look.
          
                                                         58.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Oh, Christ, Luke's not queer!   He
                    was just turnin' into a girl!
          
                               JANINE
                    Exactly.   He was a girl.
          
                               KEENAN
                    Oh!   This is just wrong.
          
                              JANINE
                    Would you rather she was attracted
                    to me?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Would you?!
          
                              JANINE
                    Maybe I would!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Whoa! HANG ON! Right now, Luke
                    needs your help. He needs to know
                    you're behind him, no matter what
                    he wants.
          
          Janine nods.
          
                              JANINE
                    So, what's all this mean?
          
                               SYDNEY
                    Bottom line? Maybe Luca really
                    likes this boy, -enough to want to
                    be female.
          
                              JANINE
                        (to Keenan)
                    Don't sneer!
          
                              KEENAN
                    Oh, come on! I know the guy.
                    We've done all kinds a' shit
                    together: Hoops, hockey!
          
                              JANINE
                    Oh, and girls can't play sports?!
          
                              KEENAN
                    Oh, -whatever! Christ, Janine!
                    Why the hell would he want to be a
                    girl?!
          
                                                                   59.
          
          
          
                              JANINE
                    That's so hard to imagine?!
          
                                 KEENAN
                    Uh, -YEAH!
          
                              SYDNEY
                    HEY! LISTEN UP! I know what I'm
                    talking about. You see this?
          
          Sydney pulls out a SNAPSHOT, shows it to Janine.
          
                                 JANINE
                    Who's he?     An Ex?   ...Oh, my God.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                    Ex me.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You're one too?
                    You're a Z?
                    You're a guy?!
          
                               SYDNEY
                    Was.   I made a terrible mistake.
          
          She and Keenan keep staring at the photo...
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    And once you finally figure out who
                    you are, it's a horrible thing not
                    being yourself. That's why it's
                    crucial we help Luke.
          
          Janine nods, grasping the significance.
          
          Keenan keeps looking from the photo to Sydney and back again.
          
                              KEENAN
                    You musta' worked out.
          
          
          EXT. CAMPUS - OUTSIDE DORM
          
          Luke sits, waiting on the steps of a campus dormitory.
          
          Janine approaches, grinning, carrying a box tied with a bow.
          Keenan trails behind, straddling his bike.
          
                              LUKE
                    What's this all about?
          
          Janine hands him the box.
          
                                                                      60.
          
          
          
          Keenan sneers, cringes.
          
                              JANINE
                    It's just a little something we
                    thought you might want.
          
          Luke opens it, pulls out a BLUE DRESS.
          
                              LUKE
                    What the hell is this for?
          
                              KEENAN
                        (elated)
                    I told her.
                        (to Janine)
                    I told ya'. What a stupid ass
                    idea!
          
                              JANINE
                    Keen! Don't! We just want you to
                    know, whatever you decide, it's all
                    right with us.
          
                              LUKE
                    Decide?! WHAT?! No, it's not!
                    Get this thing away from me! JUDAS
                    PRIEST!
          
          Luke HURLS the box out to the curb.    Keenan gives him a
          thumbs up!
          
                              KEENAN
                    Sorry, man. Think she wishes
                    everyone was female.
          
                              JANINE
                    What's that s'posed to mean?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Oh, Christ, Janine! It means he
                    doesn't want to be girl!   Like
                    he'd have to think about THAT!
          
                              JANINE
                    There happen to be millions of us
                    out there that like being female!
          
                              LUKE
                    Well, bully for YOU!
          
          Janine walks over to pick up the box.
          
                                                          61.
          
          
          
                              JANINE
                    NO! I want to know! Just exactly
                    what's wrong with being a girl?!
          
                               LUKE
                    Nothin'! It's great!    It's
                    fuckin' PHENOMENAL, if you happen
                    to BE one!
          
                              JANINE
                    Maybe we should've had this
                    conversation the other afternoon?!
          
                              LUKE
                    That wasn't my choice!
          
                              JANINE
                    I sure as hell didn't make you do
                    it!
          
                              KEENAN
                    Janine, will you just let me talk
                    to him for a sec'?
          
                              JANINE
                    Oh, what?! It's a 'GUY THING?!'
                    Give me a fuckin' break!
          
          Janine storms off with the box.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Sorry, man. She talked me into it.
                    You know Janine.
          
          Keenan picks up his bike, gets on.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Look, uh,... you do like bein' a
                    dude, right?
          
                               LUKE
                    Asshole!
          
          Keenan GRINS, rides off.
          
                              KEENAN
                        (calling back)
                    You should thank me.    The one she
                    picked out was PINK!
          
                                                                    62.
          
          
          
          UP THE WALKWAY
          
          Luke passes a sidewalk trash can and notices the gift box
          mangled inside.
          
          Glancing around to make sure no one's watching, he pulls the
          dress out, brushes off some dirt.
          
          He shoves it back in the trash, stares at it.
          
          
          INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT
          
          Luke kneels on the floor, stocking candy shelves.
          
          The CHIME BINGS.
          
          He peers over the aisle, looks around, no one in sight.
          
          Michelle appears by the soda dispenser, wary of him.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                    Hi.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Hey.     How are you?
          
                                 MICHELLE
                    I'm okay.     You?
          
          As they talk, Michelle maneuvers to get closer.
          
          Luke maneuvers to keep his distance.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Okay.     You look really nice.
          
                                MICHELLE
                    Thanks.    I was hopin' you might
                    call.
          
                              LUKE
                    I was going to.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    There's something I need to talk to
                    you about. -But did I do something
                    wrong?
          
                              LUKE
                    No. Nothin' like that. There's
                    just some stuff I've got to sort
                    out.
          
                                                                  63.
          
          
          
                                 MICHELLE
                    Like what?
          
          They gaze at each other across the magazine rack,
          
          a mountain range of silence between them,...
          
                              MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    There's nothing you can't tell me.
          
                              LUKE
                    Me too. What did you want to talk
                    to me about?
          
          They stand silent, beneath the hum of fluorescent lights.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Nothing really.   So, heard you and
                    Max really got into it?
          
                               LUKE
                    Yeah.   I kind a' lost it.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    He knows how to push buttons, huh?
                    What exactly did he say that got
                    you so pissed off?
          
                              LUKE
                    I don't know. We'd just finished a
                    game. I was all revved up.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    He's actually a really nice guy.
          
                              LUKE
                    Not sure he's too crazy about me
                    seein' his sister.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Did he scare you off?
          
                              LUKE
                    No, he doesn't "scare" me. What,
                    his struttin' around, thinkin' he's
                    such a bad ass, with his shirt
                    hangin' open half the time?
          
          Luke's surprised and embarrassed by his own words.
          
          Michelle steps away, confused.
          
                                                                    64.
          
          
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       It's just an act. He likes
                       pretending he's Joe Cool. Always
                       says you gotta' just be whatever
                       you want, and fuck 'em if they
                       can't take a joke.
          
                                 LUKE
                       Well, he's a joke alright.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Look, I'm not sure this is gonna'
                       work out.
          
                                 LUKE
                       I'm sorry, I didn't mean-
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       No. I can't do this. I'm not sure
                       you even know who you are. Much
                       less who I am. Have you ever even
                       had a girlfriend?
          
                                 LUKE
                       What's that supposed to mean?!
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       Well, if you think my brother's
                       such a "joke," how much better
                       could you think of me? We're not
                       that different, you know?
          
                                 LUKE
                       You're totally different.    He's a
                       guy, for one.
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       And he's my best friend. If you
                       don't like him, you can't like me.
          
          She exits.
          
          MINI-MART - LATER
          
          Luke kneels in the aisle, stocking shelves, distracted,
          fidgety, distressed.
          
          He glances up at the magazine rack. A Female Fitness
          magazine catches his attention. The BEAUTIFUL COVER model
          seems to MOVE.
          
          He stares at it: no movement.
          
                                                                  65.
          
          
          
          Luke approaches the rack, and flips over the magazine cover.
          
          As he steps away, he glances back at the rack,
          
          CELEBRITY MAGAZINE COVER
          
          The ADONIS on the cover comes to life. He rips off his shirt
          as he moves off one magazine cover and into another, where he
          passionately kisses the BIKINI-CLAD COVER MODEL.
          
          MAGAZINE RACK
          
          THE MODELS AND OTHERS on half a dozen covers begin stripping
          down, moving to other magazines and making out with each
          other all across the rack.
          
          OUTSIDE THE MINI-MART
          
          The windows glow among the dark trees.
          
          Inside, Luke rips up covers, HURLING magazine after magazine
          across the floor.
          
          INTERCUT WITH:
          
          INSIDE BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT
          
          Michelle leans against the shower wall, staring at the spray
          of water, upset.
          
          Steam rises, filling the bathroom.
          
          She begins SINGING, longingly,...
          
                              MICHELLE
                    "I wanna know how to go
                    To the inside of love.
                    I can't find my way through."
          
          
          Washing herself,
          
          behind the shower curtain,
          
          the timbre of her singing voice mysteriously shifts.
          
          As her hand turns the shower faucet, it changes...
          
                              MICHELLE (CONT'D)
                    "I'm outside of love,
                    To the side or above,
                    I can't find my way with you"
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
          
          A glimpse of her shoulder behind the shower curtain, grows
          more muscular,
          
          and her voice begins LOWERING IN PITCH,...
          
          as MICHELLE BECOMES MAX.
          
                              MAX
                    "Must be a special view,
                    Finding a me with a you,
                    On the inside of love."
          
          Max steps out of the shower, and towels off in the mirror.
          
          
          INT. ORLANDO'S BED & BREAKFAST - NIGHT
          
          A persistent KNOCK on the door. Sydney pulls on a robe over
          a pair of men's boxers, wiping sleep from her eyes. She
          swings the door open.
          
          Luke stands outside in POURING RAIN.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                    Oh, honey.     Come in.
          
          BY THE FIREPLACE
          
          Sydney pours hot tea.
          
                              LUKE
                    You're one too.    Why didn't you
                    tell me?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I didn't want to confuse the issue.
          
                              LUKE
                    So, it's true what you said? You
                    really know. I wouldn't change
                    unless I wanted to?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Maybe some part of you.
          
                               LUKE
                    What part?    How much of me? I
                    mean, for it to work? Half? More
                    than half? What if it was only a
                    tiny bit, -a thought?
          
                                                          67.
          
          
          
                               SYDNEY
                    I don't know. But I believe there
                    may be thousands of Z's out there,
                    millions for all we know, go their
                    whole lives without even knowing
                    they are one. Nothing ever
                    happens. You couldn't keep it from
                    happening.
          
                              LUKE
                    I love being with Michelle. How
                    come I can't control it when she's
                    around?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I think whatever part of yourself
                    you deny, just gets bigger and
                    bigger until it takes you over.
          
          Luke nods sadly.
          
                              LUKE
                    You think I don't really want to be
                    a man.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    I think for some, making it stop is
                    more important than knowing who you
                    are. It was for me.
          
                              LUKE
                    Maybe for me too.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Right now, you're Morphescent. The
                    key is to have sex with another Z.
                    You become Adulmorphic. Your
                    gender locks. You can't just
                    change anytime you want.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Another Z?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    That's why I came all the way out
                    here.
          
                              LUKE
                    And why you keep tryin' to get me
                    in the sack?
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Thought maybe I could save you some
                    distress. But you say you're not
                    attracted to me. For it to work,
                    both of us have to be into it.
          
                              LUKE
                    That won't be a problem.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                    Okay then.
          
                                 LUKE
                    Tonight.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Not right now? Okay.   Tonight.
          
          
          EXT CEMETERY - MORNING
          
          Morning dew. Acres of empty grass.   Luke sits at the top of
          a hill by his dad's grave.
          
                              LUKE
                    Remember that Christmas when Keen
                    and me accidentally set the
                    Scofields' house on fire?
          
          He stares up at the sky.
          
                               LUKE (CONT'D)
                    And that burning shingle drifted
                    over and lit up the Robertson's
                    place? The whole town was ready to
                    lynch us, and we snuck back home...
                    Two AM, you were up drinkin'
                    coffee,...
          
          He tugs out hunks of grass.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I thought you were gonna' kill us.
                    But you just looked me right in the
                    eye, and said, "Son, there's
                    leftover pizza in the fridge."
          
          A tear rims his eye.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    That was the coolest thing anyone
                    ever said. Dad, I'm in such
                    trouble.
          
                                                                     69.
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    I feel like if I let this thing in,
                    it's all over. But I don't know
                    what else to do. Guess you can't
                    figure out who you are, until you
                    accept who you might be.
          
          
          INT. ORLANDO'S BED & BREAKFAST - DAY
          
          Department store shopping bags and boxes are strewn across
          the bed.
          
          Sydney checks herself out in the full-length mirror.   A man's
          gray tuxedo jacket over lingerie.
          
          
          INT. LUMBER MILL - DAY
          
          The giant work floor of the abandoned mill.   Sunlight beams
          through holes in the roof.
          
          Max, on roller blades, practices guiding the hockey puck
          along the floor.
          
          He stops when he notices the figure watching him from outside
          the giant metal doors:
          
          Luca in the blue dress, on roller blades, hockey stick in
          hand.
          
                              MAX
                    You're about the last person I
                    expected to see.
          
                              LUCA
                    I can show you a few moves if you
                    want?
          
                               MAX
                    Yeah?   What the hell.
          
          LATER
          
          Luca demonstrates hockey technique, expertly guiding a hockey
          puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment, timber,
          and sawdust piles.
          
          All the while, she dodges Max's attempts to steal the puck.
          
          Max finally gets it, which riles Luca. She hip checks Max.
          They swerve to avoid a pipe, crash-landing on top of each
          other on a sawdust pile.
          
          They bust out LAUGHING.
          
                                                                      70.
          
          
          
                               LUCA
                    Not bad.
          
                              MAX
                    You're better than Luke.
          
                              LUCA
                    I taught him everything he knows.
          
          Luca pulls away from Max, suddenly self-conscious that Max's
          leg is on top of hers.
          
          Awkward from the broken connection, they gaze up at the blue

                              LUCA
                    Had to come back.
          
                               MAX
                    Good.
          
                              LUCA
                    Where'd you learn to speak Italian?
          
                              MAX
                    Just tourist stuff. "I'll have the
                    spaghetti bolognese." "How much
                    for a room?"
          
                              LUCA
                    Have you been?
          
                              MAX
                    Little Italy. In New York.
                    Someday, though. Want to go with
                    me?
          
          Max leans over and KISSES Luca.   She responds, tentatively at
          first,
          
          then as she grows more confident,...
          
          her face REDDENS, she GASPS.
          
          Luca pulls back, self-conscious, confused.    She brushes
          sawdust off her dress, stands.
          
                              LUCA
                    Look, this was a mistake.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          
                               MAX
                    Yeah.   Of course.   I know.
          
          Looking up, Luca sees Keenan, staring at them from across the
          floor, incredulous.
          
          Keenan exits out through the giant doors.
          
                              LUCA
                    Oh, Jesus...

                    Are you and he...?
          
                               LUCA
                    Huh?
          
                              MAX
                    It's really none of my business.
          
                               LUCA
                    No! I'm sorry.    I shouldn't've
                    come here.
          
          Max stands, brushes off the sawdust.
          
                              MAX
                    Please don't say you're "just
                    visiting." That you "need to
                    leave." I'm the one who needs to
                    leave.
          
          Max skates off across the giant shop floor.
          
          
          EXT. LUMBER MILL - DUSK
          The Semi Truck is parked alone in the middle of the asphalt.
          From inside the cab, the blue dress flips over the rolled
          down window.
          
          ACROSS THE PARKING LOT
          
          Keenan leans against a tractor, rolls his eyes, and twists
          open another beer, which he gulps.
          
          AT THE TRUCK
          
          Luke hops down from the truck cab wearing Langford U. sweats
          and a T-shirt.
          
          Keenan sits on the running board.
          
                                                                    72.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    I mean, what the FUCK is goin' on?!
                    You do wanna' be a girl? You're
                    into guys now?
          
                             LUKE
                    No! I don't know exactly.    I don't
                    know.
          
          Keenan downs his beer, pensive.   He crushes the can and hurls
          it, SMACKING a garbage can.
          
                              KEENAN
                    What about Michelle?
          
                              LUKE
                    I had to be sure. I am now. Come
                    on, it's sort of a Catch-22. I
                    make out with a girl, I start
                    turning into one. You gotta'
                    admit, it's a little weird, isn't
                    it?
          
          Suddenly uncomfortable sitting so close to Luke, Keenan
          stands.
          
                              LUKE (CONT'D)
                    Let's get outta' here.  You want a
                    ride somewhere? Janine's?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Why don't you go see her?   Think
                    you're more her type.
          
          Keenan picks up his bike.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    I'll see ya' round, okay?
          
                              LUKE
                    "See me around?"
          
          Keenan shrugs.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Look, I'm gonna' find my own place,
                    okay?   This is gettin' too fuckin'
                    weird for me.
          
                              LUKE
                    I'm goin' to Dr. Catchadourian's
                    tonight. To make this stop.
          
                                                                     73.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    I don't care. I've had it with all
                    this crap. I mean, you gonna'
                    start hittin' on me next?
          
                              LUKE
                    Yeah, that's right Keenan, you and
                    me: let's do it.
          
          Keenan rides off, leaving Luke shell-shocked.
          
          
          INT. SYDNEY'S BED & BREAKFAST - NIGHT
          
          Sydney wears a stunning black silk evening gown.
          
          Small Greek statues now adorn the room.
          
                              LUKE
                    I guess I really did need to face
                    it head on in order to see.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    It was courageous.
          
                              LUKE
                    Girls, are just, I don't know.
                    It's a different energy. They're
                    soft and warm, they can make a guy
                    feel complete.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    And multiple o's. Actually, male
                    Z's have multiple o's too. Been so
                    long I nearly forgot.
          
                              LUKE
                    Cool.
          
                              SYDNEY
                    Okay, to be honest, I'm relieved
                    you sorted this out. My conscience
                    would have bothered me for decades
                    if we'd just gone ahead without you
                    being certain.
          
          Sydney pops a cork and pours herself and Luke glasses of
          champagne. A toast.
          
                              SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    To womanhood!
          
                                                             74.
          
          
          
                                 LUKE
                       To manhood!
          
          They drink.
          
                                 LUKE (CONT'D)
                       So, how does this work?
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       We just do it. And, ...it just
                       happens.
          
          AT THE BED
          
          Luke and Sydney begin undressing.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Do you like this dress?
          
                                 LUKE
                       Sure. Looks great on you. Man,
                       dresses! Even without everything
                       else, dresses are reason enough
                       right there to stay a guy.
          
          Sydney takes this in, considers,...
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       "Stay a guy?"   Let me get this
                       straight. You didn't decide to be
                       a woman?
          
                                  LUKE
                       No.   Of course not.   What?
          
          Sydney, realizing her mistake, regroups: Plan B.
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       Just testing you. Hold on a
                       moment. There's something I
                       forgot...
          
          She retrieves some ROPE.
          
                                 LUKE
                       What's that for?
          
                                 SYDNEY
                       You've never done it with another
                       Z. Trust me, you need to be tied
                       down.
          
                                                                     75.
          
          
          
                              LUKE
                    Does it hurt?
          
                              SYDNEY
                    On the contrary.
          
          BEDSIDE TABLE - LATER
          
          The alabaster eyes of a small Greek Statue stares blankly in
          the direction of the CARNAL SOUNDS coming from the bed, OFF
          SCREEN...
          
                              SYDNEY (O.S.)
                    Just let yourself go completely.
          
                              LUKE (O.S.)
                    Wow, this is intense.
          
                              SYDNEY (O.S.)
                    When two Z's do it, the lateral
                    hypothalamus gets completely
                    overwhelmed,...
          
                                LUKE (O.S.)
                    OH, MAN!!
          
                              SYDNEY (O.S.)
                    Cellular fission kicks in, and,
                    well,... you can go Zytusional!
          
                              LUKE (O.S.)
                    Unbelievable!
          
          The chiseled eyes of a two-foot Statue of David, blankly
          stare.
          
                               LUKE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Oh no.   What's happening?
          
          Luke's voice begins RISING IN PITCH...
          
                               HALF-LUCA (O.S.)
                    What have you done?!
                        (Luca)
                    NOOOOO!!!!
          
          The SOUNDS ESCALATE, growing increasingly more INTENSE,
          
          culminating in the extraordinary, never before heard,
          
          SOUND OF ZYTUSIONAL CLIMAX...
          
                                                                  76.

          Silence.
          
          MIRROR - LATER
          
          A great-looking, bare-chested guy with Sydney's hair appears
          in reflection: MALE SYDNEY.
          
          Behind him, still strapped to the bed, is now Luca, a GAG in
          her mouth.
          
          Male Sydney carries a phone while fussing with his hair in
          the mirror.
          
                               MALE SYDNEY
                         (into phone)
                     I hear you're the best. Yes, it's
                     an emergency!   Please. Or I'll
                     have to cut it myself.
                         (to Luca)
                     Now, you look me in the eye, and
                     tell me that wasn't the best sex
                     you ever had.
          
          Luca MOANS, STRUGGLES VIOLENTLY!

                         (into phone)
                     Half an hour! YES! THANK you!
          
          Male Sydney clicks the phone off.
          
                               MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                     You can have all my clothes. Oh,
                     and I just bought these incredible
                     Anna Felucci pumps.
                         (reconsiders)
                     Maybe I should keep those.
          
          Male Sydney returns to dressing, a ribbed tank beneath a gray
          Italian tux.
          
                               MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                     Okay, I wasn't completely honest
                     with you, but I never lied either.
                     It stopped. That is what you
                     wanted.    You're Adulmorphic now.
                     The only way to switch is to do it
                     with another Z.
          
                                                                     77.
          
          
          
          He gazes at Luca, a pang of guilt.   He sits on the bed,
          speaks softly.
          
                              MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    I know you don't believe me, but
                    this is the right thing for you.
                    Eventually, you'll figure that on
                    your own. But I could tell it was
                    just gonna' take way too long!
          
          Luca stares, distraught.
          
                              MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, for Chris' sake. Being a woman
                    doesn't make you any less of a man!
          
          The entire bed LURCHES back and forth as Luca struggles.
          
          Male Sydney winces, pangs of guilt, which turn to anger...
          
                              MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                    Damnit! I can't live my whole LIFE
                    wrong 'cause of one stupid mistake!
                    I'm a man! I love havin' this
                    chest, these arms! But most of
                    all,...
                        (grabs his pant crotch)
                    Welcome home, boys! Hang in there,
                    I'm takin' you out for a SPIN!
          
          LATER
          
          Luca lies alone in the room, bound and gagged on the bed.
          
          A KNOCK at the door.
          
          Luca MOANS and tries to YELL through her gagged mouth.
          
          The KNOCK PERSISTS.
          
          SIDE WINDOW
          
          The ivy parts and Keenan peers in.
          
          His eyes GO WIDE.
          
          He pushes the window open a little, whispers...
          
                              KEENAN
                    What's goin' on? Where is she?
          
          Luca MOANS and struggles against the ropes.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Whoa. I guess I really didn't
                    think you were gonna' go this way.
                    Okay. Whatever.
          
          Keenan sits on the edge of the bed.
          
          Luca MOANS trying to get Keenan to remove the gag.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Hang on a sec'. Look, I'm sorry
                    about earlier, -what I said. But
                    all this stuff.   Janine and I
                    split up.
          
          Luca stops struggling, shocked.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    All I ever did was piss her off.
                    I'm not sure she even wants a guy.
                    And you think I'm so much better
                    with girls than you, and sure I can
                    get laid anytime I want, but truth
                    is, I never even woulda' hit on her
                    if it weren't for watchin' you.
          
          Keenan climbs on top of Luca, starts untying her hands,
          straddling her.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    The way you just talk to 'em about
                    anything, like it was okay. I
                    gotta' get her back, man.
          
          With Herculean effort, Keenan struggles to hold back tears...
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    It's like the whole world's blown
                    apart. Ah, shit. Man, you havin'
                    tits now is just weird.
          
          
          EXT. WOODED HIGHWAY
          
          The truck THUNDERS along through the trees, head lamps
          BLAZING, dashboard lights bright.
          
          Keenan's at the wheel.
          
                              LUCA
                    Janine said he's definitely there.
          
                                                                  79.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    Did she mention me?
          
          Luca indicates 'no.'
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    Women. God, I'm glad you want to
                    be a guy. You are absolutely sure,
                    right?
          
                                 LUCA
                    Yes!
          
                              KEENAN
                    'Cause it really is totally cool
                    either way.
          
                                 LUCA
                    I'm SURE.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Okay, I just don't want you to
                    think I'm zerophobic, or somethin'.
          
          
          EXT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - NIGHT
          
          Students gather outside the farmhouse pool hall.
          
          Male Sydney spots his prey, and approaches Jeremy, who hangs
          out alone on the grass near a small bonfire.
          
          The firelight licks their faces.
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    You're on the wrestling team.
          
                               JEREMY
                    Yeah.   You catch the meets?
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    Just an educated guess.    Wanna'
                    wrestle?
          
          Jeremy LAUGHS, glances around, unsure what to make of him.
          
          
          INSIDE THE SEMI
          The truck CAREENS around a CURVE.
          
                              LUCA
                    Can't this thing go any faster?!
          
                                                                 80.
          
          
          
          Luca considers...
          
                              LUCA (CONT'D)
                    You know me better than anyone.
                    What do you think?
          
                                KEENAN
                    Huh?
          
                              LUCA
                    I mean, if I weren't a hundred
                    percent sure which I'm s'posed to
                    be. If you had to say.
          
                              KEENAN
                    All I know is, every time you look
                    at Michelle, or think about her,
                    you smile. What the hell else do
                    you need to know?
          
                              LUCA
                    It's not right. She deserves to be
                    with a normal guy.
          
                              KEENAN
                    So, you don't get to be with
                    anyone?
          
          They drive in silence.
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    That why they call it "zero-
                    philia?"
          
                              LUCA
                    She's not gonna' want some guy who
                    thinks maybe he's supposed to be a
                    girl sometimes.
          
                              KEENAN
                    How do you know? Did you ask?
          
                              LUCA
                    No way I'm gonna' ask her that.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Well, you have to.   Where are your
                    nads, man?!
          
          Luca glares at him.   Keenan realizes his mistake...
          
                              KEENAN (CONT'D)
                    We'll get 'em back.
          
                                                                        81.
          
          
          
          The truck ROARS on.
          
          
          EXT. POLLY WOG'S
          
          As Janine looks on, Male Sydney moves in for the kill.
          
                                 MALE SYDNEY
                       Come on, let's grab a couple beers.
          
          Sydney tugs at his T-shirt.
          
                                 MALE SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                       Of course, I see you brought your
                       own six-pack.
          
          
          GRAVEL PARKING LOT
          
          Keenan and Luca hop down from Luke's truck, scanning the
          crowd.
          
          Janine waves to Luca and points across the way.
          
          Luca nods.
          
                                   LUCA
                       Let's go!
          
                                   KEENAN
                       Jeez.    She won't even look at me.
          
          They stride across the field.
          
          BEHIND THE BARN
          
          Male Sydney shoves Jeremy passionately against the wall.
          
                                 MALE SYDNEY
                       I do love to mess with Texas.
          
          Keenan and Luca appear around the corner.
          
                                   LUCA
                       There!
          
                                 MALE SYDNEY
                       We better get outta' here.
          
          Keenan reaches them first.      He wrenches Male Sydney and
          Jeremy apart.
          
                                                                  82.
          
          
          
                                JEREMY
                    Keenan?!    It's not the way it
                    looks.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Oh, Jeremy, I so profoundly don't
                    care if you're queer. Trust me,
                    around here, that's nothin'!
          
          Luca catches up and TACKLES Male Sydney, throttling him on
          the ground.
          
                              LUCA
                    You son-of-a-bitch!       We're doin' it
                    again, right now!
          
                               JEREMY
                    Jeez.   She your wife?!
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    No!  She just said, she wants sex!
                        (to Luca)
                    I can't. I'm sorry.
          
                                 LUCA
                    "Sorry?!"     Fuck you!    FUCK ME!
                    NOW!
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    It won't work.
          
                              LUCA
                    We're goin' inside right here!
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    I'll scream rape.
          
                                 LUCA
                    So will I.
          
          They pull Male Sydney toward the barn door.
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    But I'm gay!
          
                                 LUCA
                    So what?
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    We both need to be into it, or
                    nothing happens.
          
                                                           83.
          
          
          
                              KEENAN
                    Such bullshit.
          
          Jeremy moves off, wide-eyed and disturbed.
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    That's why I became a woman in the
                    first place. I couldn't handle it.
                    Figured if I was female, it was
                    okay to like guys.
          
                              KEENAN
                    She's lyin'.
          
          Male Sydney shakes his head 'no.'
          
                              LUCA
                    You're tellin' me, 'cause you're
                    straight as a girl and I'm straight
                    as a guy, we can screw and switch,
                    but...
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    'cause you're straight as a girl,
                    and I'm gay as a guy, even if we do
                    it...
          
                              LUCA
                    I'm just screwed.
          
          Keenan's confused...
          
                              KEENAN
                    Jeez. You need trigonometry to
                    figure this thing out. Maybe
                    you're 'bi.'
          
                              MALE SYDNEY
                    In my world the Kinsey scale's
                    three-dimensional, but trust me,
                    girls do nothing for me. Zilch!
                        (to Keenan)
                    You, on the other hand...
          
          Keenan RECOILS.
          
                              LUCA
                    What am I gonna' do?
          
                              KEENAN
                    What if he's lying?    I say, do him
                    again anyway!
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
          
                                LUCA
                    Fine!
          
                               MALE SYDNEY
                    Fine.   Waste of time.
          
          Luca notices Michelle standing nearby.
          
                                LUCA
                    Michelle.
          
                                KEENAN
                    Oh, man.
          
                              LUCA
                    It's not what you think.
          
          Keenan and Luca realize that she's Luca right now, not Luke.
          
                              KEENAN
                    What does she think?
          
                              LUCA
                    I'm not sure.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    You asshole!
          
          Michelle moves off.
          
          ALONGSIDE THE BARN
          
          Luca runs up.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    I don't believe this.    You slept
                    with that guy?!
          
                              LUCA
                    It's not what you think.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Oh, please! What about Max?
          
                              LUCA
                    What about him?
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Don't you care about him at all?!
          
                              LUCA
                    Not like that: I'm straight!   I'm
                    attracted to you!
          
                                                          85.
          
          
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Oh, who cares, you idiot! And
                    sorry to break it to you, but I'm
                    straight too.
          
                              LUCA
                    No. This'll sound crazy, but I'm
                    not who you think I am-
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Oh, Christ, Luke, -Luca: I know who
                    you are!
          
          Luca stares, stunned.
          
                              LUCA
                    You know I'm a Zerophiliac?!
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Yes! So you can just go fuck
                    yourself. -Literally!
          
                              LUCA
                    Does Max know who I am?
          
                              MICHELLE
                    What if he does? Do you?
          
                              LUCA
                    He's a guy!
          
                              MICHELLE
                    And you're a girl!
          
                               LUCA
                    I'm not!
          
          Michelle gestures "Oh really?!"
          
                              LUCA (CONT'D)
                    I'm not supposed to be!
          
                              MICHELLE
                    There's no supposed to be anything,
                    you just ARE!
          
                              LUCA
                    Is that what you think?!   NO!
          
                                                                   86.
          
          
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Well, then congratulations! You're
                    a guy, just like every other guy I
                    ever met! I can't believe you
                    slept with him!
          
                              LUCA
                    He was a woman! I was tricked.   I
                    didn't know I'd switch.
          
          Michelle stares, incredulous.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    You're gonna' tell me he's a Z
                    too?! Both of you?!
          
                              LUCA
                    Yes!
          
                              MICHELLE
                    Well, that's just perfect. What,
                    is there something in the water
                    around here?!
          
                              LUCA
                    She told me it would make it stop.
                    That it would keep me from turning
                    into a girl.
          
                              MICHELLE
                    So what?! Why's that so important
                    to you?! There's no way this was
                    gonna' work.
          
                              LUCA
                    Because I'm a Zerophiliac.
          
                               MICHELLE
                    Because you can't stand being one!
                    Bye, Luca.
          
                              LUCA
                        (correcting her)
                    Luke.
          
          She glances back, sad and angry.
          
          Luca watches her go, distraught, and then RUNS...
          
          ATOP A GRASSY HILLSIDE
          
          Luca collapses on the ground, overlooking Polly Wog's.
          
                                                                   87.
          
          
          
          Janine and Keenan run up, a few yards behind. They sit
          nearby, catching their breath, unsure what to say.
          
          Luca gazes up at the moon.
          
                              LUCA (CONT'D)
                    What's it like? To really make
                    love?
          
          They all three gaze up at the moon.
          
          Keenan steals a glance at Janine.
          
                              KEENAN
                    The best part's just lyin' there
                    after. Really close, really far
                    away.
          
                              JANINE
                    Like goin' to the moon, maybe.
          
                              KEENAN
                    Yeah. ...They should open a pizza
                    joint up there.
          
          Janine glares at him, and Keenan winces.
          
                              LUCA
                    What am I gonna' do?
          
                              KEENAN
                    Maybe being a woman'll turn out
                    okay. Like being an elevated
                    member of the male species.
          
                              JANINE
                    Elevated "member?"
          
                              KEENAN
                    I just mean, maybe he'll learn to
                    like it.
          
                              JANINE
                        (sarcastic, to Keenan)
                    As hard as that is to conceive!
          
                              LUCA
                    Shut up! Both of you! What, you
                    want a written guarantee? You're
                    so damn lucky! You're into him,
                    he's into you. Super-glue! What
                    the hell else do you need to know?
          
                                                                  88.
          
          
          
          Janine looks to Keenan with a look of remorse, hopeful...
          
                                 KEENAN
                       I think you're the female half of
                       me.
          
                                 JANINE
                       I think you're the macho half of
                       me.
          
          They kiss.
          
                                 LUCA
                       And I don't know what half of who
                       the hell I am.
          
          They look to Luca surprised,...
          
          then all three bust out LAUGHING.
          
                                 JANINE
                       What are you gonna' do?
          
                                 LUCA
                       I don't know. I prefer being a
                       guy, but I'm a girl? I'm attracted
                       to Max, but I'm in love with
                       Michelle? It's like I'm s'posed to
                       be both.
          
          Her own admission surprises her.
          
                                 LUCA (CONT'D)
                       Not too practical. But at least
                       now I know.
          
          She almost laughs, sad, but relieved.
          
          
          INT. POLLY WOG'S POOL HALL - LATE NIGHT
          
          The place is cleared out, save for Polly cleaning up behind
          the bar and Max, alone, shooting pool.
          
                                 POLLY
                       Girl trouble? Boy trouble?
          
          Max shrugs.
          
                                 POLLY (CONT'D)
                       How about we get a game in before
                       dawn?
          
                                                         89.
          
          
          
          Max nods, sets up a new rack.
          
                              MAX
                    What's the point? It never works
                    out. Or they just cheat on you
                    anyway.
          
                              POLLY
                    Liverpool was a veritable shagfest
                    when I was your age. A boulevard
                    of broken hearts. But eventually,
                    I found him.
          
          She sinks the cue ball in a corner pocket.
          
                               POLLY (CONT'D)
                    Scratch.   Then he died.
          
                               MAX
                    Sorry.
          
                              POLLY
                    Everything reminded me of him. So,
                    I came here, half way round the
                    world to forget. Then created this
                    place, just like the one where we
                    met.
          
                              MAX
                    He can't handle this. Us.   He
                    can't handle who he is.
          
                              POLLY
                    You being a guy too?
          
                              MAX
                    Or him being a girl.
          
          Polly's confused, but presses on.
          
                              POLLY
                    Everyone's terrified. But once you
                    really know someone, and they know
                    you, it makes you whole.
          
                              MAX
                    No one wants to know who I really
                    am.
          
                              POLLY
                    You're so sure?
          
                                                                       90.
          
          
          
                              MAX
                    It's impossible. He was the one
                    person I thought could understand.
                    But no, it's impossible.
          
          Max puts the cue stick down, and moves off.    Polly calls
          after,...
          
                              POLLY
                    It's worth finding out.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Max slides out from under an old car. Seeing Luca, he
          hardens, wiping his greasy hands on a rag.
          
                                LUCA
                    Hey.
          
                                MAX
                    Hey.
          
                              LUCA
                    I know she doesn't want to talk to
                    me. But do you know where I can
                    find her?
          
                                MAX
                    New York.     Left two days ago.
          
                                LUCA
                    Oh, man.    ...You're staying?
          
                              MAX
                    Just 'til Friday.
          
          Max returns to his work.
          
                              LUCA
                    I wanted to apologize to her.
                    Forget it, I don't know,...
                    Obviously, nothing's gonna' ever be
                    with me and her, but I just wish
                    she knew how much I, -and that I
                    wasn't cheating, I was just trying
                    to be a man for her.
                        (laughs)
                    She'd have a field day with that
                    one, huh?
          
                                MAX
                    True.
          
                                                                 91.
          
          
          
                              LUCA
                    If you talk to her, please just
                    tell her, I'm sorry, and I wish her
                    the best,... everything.
          
                                 MAX
                    Thanks.
          
          Luca 'nods', not fully understanding Max's response.
          
                                 LUCA
                    I'm sorry.     To you too.
          
                                 MAX
                    For what?
          
                              LUCA
                    Mixed signals, I guess.
          
          Max walks toward the back, then YELPS, wincing.
          
                               MAX
                    Ow!   Son-of-a-bitch!
          
                              LUCA
                    You all right?
          
                              MAX
                    Stepped on a nail.    Damn it!
          
          Max sits on a crate, starts untying his boot.
          
                              MAX (CONT'D)
                    So, you gettin' used to this at
                    all?
          
                                 LUCA
                    I wish.
          
                              MAX
                    You definitely had me confused.
          
                              LUCA
                    For whatever it's worth.     I think
                    you're a pretty hot guy.
          
                               MAX
                    Thanks.   But you're not interested?
          
                              LUCA
                    Truth is, I am. And I guess it
                    sounds crazy, but I couldn't do
                    that to Michelle.
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          
          Luca moves off, as Max removes his boot, and his sock.
          
                               MAX
                     For whatever it's worth, I think
                     you're pretty hot too.
          
                                  LUCA
                     Thanks.
          
                               MAX
                     Too bad you're a moron.
          
                                  LUCA
                     Excuse me?
          
                               MAX
                     I have incontrovertible proof.
          
          Luca stares at Max, and then down at his ankle, at the TATTOO
          OF A GREEN BIRD.
          
          Max meets her eyes,
          
          and it finally dawns on Luca,
          
          standing, in shock, and now putting it all together,
          
          she LUNGES for him, nailing him to the ground, kissing him.
          
          She RIPS Max's T-shirt as they fall to the asphalt, knocking
          over oil cans.
          
          Passion.   Unbridled.
          
          IN THE PARTS YARD
          
          Luca manhandles Max, shoving him against a pile of huge
          tires, as Max's face transforms...
          
          BY OLD RADIATORS
          
          Michelle slams back onto the crabgrass. She pulls Luca
          toward her as Luca's face transforms into Luke.
          
          BY DISCARDED TRUCK CHASSIS
          
          Luke and Michelle roll on the crabgrass, kissing,
          
          TRANSFORMING as they roll, into Luca and Max and Michelle and
          Luke and Luca -or was that Max?
          
                                                                       93.
          
          
          
          INT. MICHELLE'S BEDROOM - DAWN
          
          White gauze curtains billow in the morning breeze. The sun's
          first rays light up the down comforter and white pillows.
          
          Michelle stirs slowly, then BOLTS AWAKE.       She grabs Luke, a
          vise grip around his torso.
          
          He awakens, groggy.
          
                                   LUKE
                       Hey you.    ...Good morning.   What's
                       up?
          
          Michelle bites her lip, embarrassed, releases him.
          
                                  LUKE (CONT'D)
                       You still think I'm going to bolt,
                       don't you?
          
                                 MICHELLE
                       And leave me stuck.
          
          He smiles.
          
                                 LUKE
                       What do you want, a gender pre-nup?
          
                                  MICHELLE
                       Maybe.   I have to go to work.
          
          She nuzzles him playfully.      Luke glances at the clock, MOANS.
          
                                 LUKE
                       Only place I'm going is back to
                       sleep.
          
                                MICHELLE
                       No. I can't show up at work like
                       this.
          
                                   LUKE
                       Oh, yeah.
          
          He smiles, folds into her.
          
          FADE OUT
