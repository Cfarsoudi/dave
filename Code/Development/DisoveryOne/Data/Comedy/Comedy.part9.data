"I'LL DO ANYTHING"

                                      Screenplay by

                                     James L. Brooks

                                           1994

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                

               FADE IN:

               INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

               The CAMERA briskly retreats as FORTY, HIGHLY CHARGED, 
               ATTRACTIVE, YOUNG PEOPLE march towards it. Each side of the 
               frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the 
               middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,... everyone 
               having the "high" of their lives.

               INT. NEW YORK CLUB - NIGHT

               As the troupe, with geometric precision, spills into a large 
               room (containing a raised dance floor); the CAMERA begins to 
               move past dancing couples as a legend appears:

               'This is 1975 and Matt Hobbs is singled out for the first 
               time.'

               And now the CAMERA reveals MATT HOBBS. His open, friendly, 
               American face slips between some of the many cracks in his 
               profession. The face at 26, and forever more, not arresting 
               enough for a leading man; not quirky enough for a "character." 
               Matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way 
               past a knot of people. He dances furiously for two seconds, 
               then steps down as THE DANCERS BEGIN TO SING "WOW", but just 
               as the song breaks out musically, we hear the SOUND OF PEOPLE 
               SHHHING; the singers falter and then stop as the party-goers 
               gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted TV 
               set.

               MAN ON TV

               We can barely discern the words. . ."with his review is 
               Leonard Graff."

               A FRANTIC ACTRESS yelps a command:

                                     FRANTIC ACTRESS
                         I can't hear over this shhing.

               Silence, then:

                                     TV CRITIC
                         ...a play about guess what? That's 
                         right, young people.

               ON MATT

               He stands next to a ruggedly handsome and extremely nauseous 
               CONTEMPORARY.

                                     HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY
                         I can't look.

                                     MATT
                         Good idea, let's not.

               He begins to walk, the Handsome Contemporary falling into 
               step. Everyone they pass is straining, upwards, at the TV.

                                     HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY
                         How can we not listen to this?

                                     MATT
                         We'll know all we need to from the 
                         reaction.

               At that moment, the rest of the party-goers turn from the TV 
               as one, looking mugged. (One girl briefly gets our attention 
               because she is particularly distraught; tears streaming down 
               her angry face. The mixture of tears and rage are, of course, 
               the chemical components of incredible sexiness. Her name is 
               BETH.) A TORTURED MALE DANCER offers an incantation.

                                     TORTURED MALE DANCER
                         He should be shot, he should be dead, 
                         he should rot in hell, then come 
                         back as the soap cake in a urinal.

                                     HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY
                              (to dancer)
                         He didn't like it?

               The DIRECTOR moves through the group, bucking up spirits.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Don't worry. He doesn't count. We'll 
                         just wait for the papers.

               ON MATT AND FELLOW CAST MEMBERS - LATER

               As they morosely watch the Director approach.

                                     MATT
                         Hey, no matter what this review says, 
                         the play was a great experience for 
                         me.

               Beth looks at him, puzzled.

                                     MATT
                              (again)
                         I mean, it is about process, right?

                                     HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY
                         Matt's right. Good Lord, it is what 
                         we're alive for.

               Beth turns from the conversation, finding it preposterous, 
               then rivets her attention on the Director, walking towards 
               them, holding a ridiculously thick sheaf of papers. Beth 
               begins to sob in anticipation.

                                     MATT
                         You've just got to be tougher than 
                         this.

                                     BETH
                              (incredulous)
                         Tougher than this?!?

               The Director reaches them.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         I took it all down over the phone. 
                         It's quite bad. And, unfortunately, 
                         it's very, very long. I've got a 
                         broken heart and writers' cramp. 
                         He...

                                     MATT
                         He's nuts.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         He savages everyone.

                                     MATT
                         I don't want to hear anymore. Let's 
                         dance.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Except you, Matt.

               They all look at him.

                                     HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY
                              (fiercely to Matt)
                         You filthy bastard.

                                     BETH
                              (drawing closer to 
                              Matt)
                         What did he say?

               The Director hunts for the paragraph.

                                     MATT
                         Don't read it.

                                     OTHER ACTOR
                         Oh, please. You can't wait to run 
                         out of here, buy a flashlight, and 
                         then go into some dark alley and 
                         drool over every word.

                                     MATT
                              (truthfully)
                         You're wrong. I'm maybe relieved and 
                         curious. That's it.

                                     BETH
                              (wildly exasperated)
                         What did they say about him?

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (reading)
                         ...'in the midst of this delirium of 
                         pretension...'

                                     MATT
                         Don't. This divisive crap won't...

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (again)
                         '...one actor, rather miraculously, 
                         manages to provide passion and, yes, 
                         truth. Matt Hobbs, in the supporting 
                         role of Jesus, manages to touch the 
                         heart long after you thought it numbed 
                         by boredom.'

               The table of actors look at a sober Matt. A long beat and 
               then, against his will, he grins... then a short, involuntary 
               barking laugh of joy... then:

                                     MATT
                              (to his colleagues 
                              with sincerity)
                         Sorry.

                                                                  MORPH TO:

               ESTABLISHING SHOT - L.A. MODERATE INCOME STREET

               As we HEAR the next lines of "WOW", BEGIN MAIN TITLES as the 
               CAMERA BOOMS UP to the outside of a small apartment as a 
               legend appears on screen:

                                   'EMMY NIGHT - 1980'

               Beth, now 27, is standing in front of a TV set showing the 
               Emmy dancers performing a phrase of "WOW". She screams out.

                                     BETH
                         Will you get in here--for God's sake?

               INT. ANOTHER ROOM

               Matt, 30, is on the phone.

                                     MATT
                              (into phone)
                         Come on, Ma, how could I show up 
                         tonight when my union is boycotting 
                         the Emmys? Look, I have to hang up.

                                     BETH (O. S.)
                              (screaming voice)
                         It's on right now... right now... 
                         right this second! You will miss 
                         it!!

                                     MATT
                              (into phone)
                         I gotta go. Watch!

               Matt hangs up and tear-asses into the living room. Beth 
               screams as his name is read.

                                     TV VOICE
                              (on TV)

                         Court Martial'... And the winner is 
                         Powers Boothe for 'Jonestown--Story 
                         of a Massacre.'

                                     BETH
                         Shit! Fuck! Shit!

                                     MATT
                         He was good.

                                     BETH
                              (again)
                         Shit! Shit! Shit! Fuck! Shit! Look, 
                         he even showed up.

               TV INSERT - POWERS BOOTHE ACCEPTANCE SPEECH

                                     MATT
                         That took courage. I wonder if they 
                         send you something for just being 
                         nominated?

                                     BETH
                         Of all the pathetic questions.

                                     MATT
                              (sharply)
                         Why are you being so damn foul?

               Beth glares at him, on the verge of taking him on--but he is 
               looking at her very directly... the lack of any other agenda 
               giving him a temporary edge... Beth decides to state the 
               unadorned truth.

                                     BETH
                         We've been going back and forth on 
                         our status for so long. I was hoping 
                         that if you won, it might mean 
                         something for us.

                                     MATT
                         Look, Beth... the only...

               She is waving her hand in a circle... he is puzzled.

                                     BETH
                         Please go fast. I can't take you 
                         dragging it out.

                                     MATT
                              (a bit faster)
                         The only reason I haven't...

                                     BETH
                         I promised myself I wouldn't be so 
                         bossy. Take your time!! Was that 
                         bossy too?

                                     MATT
                              (persisting)
                         The only thing I have against getting 
                         married is that it might not be fair 
                         because I'm going to stay with acting 
                         forever and you know how erratic the 
                         money's been and there's no resolve...

                                     BETH
                         Do I get to vote? I'm going to tell 
                         you something I never told you before. 
                         Your feeling towards your work is 
                         one of the things I love most about 
                         you.

                                     MATT
                         Really?

                                     BETH
                         Maybe the most.

                                     MATT
                         Hey, then we have no problem here. 
                         Marry me.

               They kiss, then break, murmuring to each other.

                                     BETH
                         Stinker, I almost gave up on you.

                                     MATT
                         I was just worried whether I could 
                         make you happy.

                                                                  MORPH TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - FOUR A.M.

               A SET FRAME showing several clusters of waiting people. A 
               man rushes to one of these clusters, cueing this group to 
               sing the next phrase of "WOW". As an extremely hyper Matt 
               enters, the SONG STOPS and a legend appears:

                                          '1986'

                                     MATT
                              (extremely hyper)
                         Everything's okay... Great... She's 
                         six or eight pounds even. Oh, God... 
                         Nothing like it. I'll tell you 
                         something amazing. They really reach 
                         right into her stomach and pull out 
                         this baby. It's not just a rumor. 
                         God. I understand the expression 
                         'mind blowing' for the first time. 
                         It means something so wonderful 
                         happens that the top of your head 
                         comes off and your brain pops out. 
                         Part of it was terrifying, the baby 
                         was turned and they couldn't budge 
                         her. I kept looking at this one woman 
                         doctor's eyes. And when Jeannie 
                         finally came out, this doctor and I 
                         each wiped away a tear at the exact 
                         same time, caught ourselves doing 
                         it, and then laughed together at the 
                         same time. Nothing can prepare you 
                         for it. You know why you're alive.

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

               As Matt walks with pep, accompanied by a burst of "WOW".

               INT. BETH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Beth holds BABY JEANNIE and wears a scowl.

                                     MATT
                         How you doing? What's wrong?

                                     BETH
                         My mother said you were flirting 
                         with the doctor during the delivery.

               On Matt's expression...

                                                                  MORPH TO:

               INT. MODEST ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

               Matt and Beth lie on an open sofa-bed. "WOW" is completed, 
               though with a dirge-like cadence. We hear a baby crying over 
               a cheap walky-talky near their bed.

                                     MATT
                         Could you get her, honey? I have 
                         that big reading tomorrow.

                                     BETH
                         No, I have a lot to do tomorrow, 
                         too. I have to borrow on our Christmas 
                         Club, I have to...

                                     MATT
                         Don't worry about money anymore.
                              (on her look)
                         I didn't want to tell you, because 
                         it may sound a little strange when I 
                         say it out loud. You know me, I'm 
                         never that cocky. But I'm going to 
                         get 'Spider Woman'. It's me or Raul 
                         and I've never been so sure. It's 
                         weird, but I just know it. I do.

                                     BETH
                              (broadly)
                         Boy, am I reassured. What good news. 
                         Isn't that a load off?

               INT. BABY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Where we see the crying baby holding the walky-talky in front 
               of its mouth as it screams into the mouthpiece.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     MATT
                         I am gonna get this part, Beth.

                                     BETH
                         I can't stand this anymore.

               END MAIN TITLES

               FADE IN:

               INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - MORNING

               It's an awful place... the start-up apartment he's way too 
               old for... but we don't yet see his humble quarters. Rather:

               A BLURRED IMAGE

               Then, the screen is CLEARED ON ONE HALF so we see half of a 
               contact lens holder in focus--the other half blurred--until 
               Matt gets his second contact in.

               MATT'S POV

               A tube of tooth bleach. CLOSE ON THE DIRECTIONS, then:

               ON MATT

               Bleaching his teeth... finishing... smiling in the mirror... 
               This is the bleached smile of fear--true fear--the awful 
               state of having lost your way. The phone rings. Matt clears 
               his voice before answering.

                                     MATT
                              (into phone)
                         Hello... Hi, Beth. I'm glad you 
                         finally returned my call. What are 
                         you so mad about?
                              (again, into phone)
                         YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE 
                         WHO CAN SCREAM, I CAN SCREAM, TOO.

               Matt was so suddenly, emotionally extended that the anger 
               leaves him that quickly... just a strange atypical lightning 
               bolt of rage toward life and women.

                                     MATT
                              (again, into phone)
                         You know what? I'm being a sort of 
                         gutless wonder here. I'm yelling 
                         back at you because I'm embarrassed. 
                         I won't be able to take the kid when 
                         I said... Why don't you listen for a 
                         second?

               He rubs his head with both hands, including the one holding 
               the phone. This allows us to hear his ex-wife repeat the 
               same sentence over and over again.

                                     BETH (V. O.)
                              (from phone)
                         ...You're taking her... You're taking 
                         her... You're taking her...

                                     MATT
                         Beth, I know exactly how long it's 
                         been and I feel strange as hell not 
                         seeing her but this isn't a choice. 
                         I'm broke. It's the driest spell of 
                         my life. I'm not saying it's your 
                         problem, but it's no place for a six-
                         year-old. What can I do? The only 
                         full-time job I seem to have is not 
                         showing how scared I am. What? No, 
                         that's not something I said before.
                              (accepting compliment)
                         Well, thanks.

               Beth turns angry again. Matt finds, unfortunately, that he's 
               got one more act of bravado left.

                                     MATT
                              (again, into phone)
                         Beth, Hey... hey. Never mind, I'll 
                         do it.

               He hangs up.

                                     MATT
                              (again, to himself)
                         I must get work. I will take anything. 
                         I must get work. I must not be 
                         embarrassed by these pep talks to 
                         myself...

               EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

               As Matt walks from the outdoor parking lot, past inexpensive 
               homes. In the lot, on private lawns and every public bench, 
               at each street corner, are various actors doing the relaxation 
               exercises which will form the basis of A DANCE, as they go 
               over their "sides".

                                     MIDDLE-AGED ACTOR
                         ...feathers I'm blowing. What am I, 
                         a duck?

               We pass various actors going over alternate sentences for 
               the same speech so that we get a sense of the speech as a 
               whole from the sum of its parts.

                                     VARIOUS YOUNG ACTORS
                         1) I'm not thinking about whether 
                         I'm going to shoot you. I'm...
                         2)...trying to decide where.
                         3)...the little spot behind the ear 
                         where you die before you hear the 
                         shot...
                         4)...on the left side of the belly 
                         which is a very mean place.

               EXT. POPCORN PICTURES - DAY

               An office building of clear architectural merit located in 
               an industrial area. Even the sign "Popcorn Pictures" has all 
               the artistic dignity the name itself lacks... MUSIC ENTERS... 
               Gradually, movement BECOMES CHOREOGRAPHED...i.e., the young 
               actor and actress running across the street do so with 
               uncommon grace. The area Matt passes is very crowded and we 
               still haven't reached the most congested area of all as we 
               STUDY FACES and HEAR snatches of the actors' preparation.

                                     MIDDLE-AGED ACTOR
                         What am I, a duck?

                                     OLDER ACTRESS
                         Sure I'll tell you... Favor first... 
                         Do a nice middle-aged lady a favor... 
                         A fair trade... tell you what you 
                         want to know in return for a...
                              (grimaces over dialogue 
                              she must say)
                         ...a pity fu...

               MUSIC BECOMING MORE INSISTENT as we approach the building--
               the mumbling of the actors taking on the SOUND of a Wailing 
               Wall...

                                     VARIOUS YOUNG HYSTERICAL ACTRESSES
                         ...the height of ego. You think your 
                         he-manness can make me get on that 
                         elevator even though I'm phobic?... 
                         I CAN'T GET ON THAT ELEVATOR. I don't 
                         care if... they catch us. DO YOU 
                         GET... IT. DO YOU GET IT! I CAN'T! I 
                         CAN'T... three, please.

               THREE HYSTERICAL ACTRESSES

               SINGING the dialogue...

                                     SINGING ACTRESSES
                         ...can't get on the elevator... can't 
                         get on the elevator... even if you 
                         make me... even if you make me. Do 
                         you get it?... do you get it?...

               TWO ACTRESSES

               Standing near each other--exchange glares as they break each 
               other's concentration and move apart... THEIR MOVEMENT SERVING 
               as our gateway to DANCING... The SONG "MAKE BELIEVE" enters 
               fully now and builds in intensity, reaching a repeated phrase, 
               as we move to Matt and he enters the building, thereby cutting 
               off the song.

               ON MATT

               As the SONG continues in intensity, Matt enters the building 
               at the end of a repeated phrase cutting off the song as we 
               move to:

               ANGLE ON RECEPTION AREA

               Where CATHY BRESLOW, age 30, waits. Hollywood is a bit of an 
               uphill struggle for Cathy. She is bright where others are 
               brilliant, pretty where others are gorgeous, enormously hard 
               working where others are obsessive-compulsive. She is clearly 
               waiting for someone while reading an enormously thick book 
               galley. Matt almost scoots by her, then stops.

                                     MATT
                         Hi... See, I did recognize you. You 
                         didn't have to wait for me.

                                     CATHY
                         Well, I wanted to introduce you. As 
                         if knowing me would help.

               INT. POPCORN PICTURES - DAY

               MOVING SHOT. Staircase packed with actors, an uphill slalom 
               almost impossible to navigate.

                                     CATHY
                         It's a ridiculously awful movie.

                                     MATT
                         Well, challenge. I wasn't sure you'd 
                         remember me... let alone help...

                                     CATHY
                         Stop. You're good. I'm doing them a

                                     MATT
                         Well, that's a fresh slant.

               They reach the casting assistant, CLAIRE.

                                     CATHY
                         Claire, this is Matt Hobbs.

               As Matt is handed a set of sides, we SHOOT PAST Matt as he 
               watches Cathy move back down the stairs before he can say 
               another word. She moves with wit. He is struck by her. He 
               looks back at Claire, who has an intricate hairdo and a ready 
               smile.

                                     CLAIRE
                         Hi. Sorry. We're running behind... 
                         Please forgive us.

                                                          LONG DISSOLVE TO:

               SAME SHOT - TWO HOURS LATER

               Her hairdo wilted, her blouse soiled, her smile gone, the 
               tendons of her neck prominent.

                                     CLAIRE
                              (fiercely)
                         Matt Hobbs? Matt Hobbs!

               ON MATT

               Going over his lines. Hearing his name, he rises. Claire 
               gestures him in.

               INT. BURKE'S OFFICE - DAY

               The walls are pockmarked with movie posters. THREE MEN sit 
               in an area some distance from the desk. The casting director, 
               MARTIN, makes the introduction:

                                     MARTIN
                         This is Matt Hobbs... This is John 
                         Earl McAlpine, the director.

                                     MCALPINE
                         Good to see you.

               He speaks with an Australian accent, gets half-up and extends 
               his hand.

                                     MARTIN
                         ...and Burke Adler, the producer.

                                     BURKE
                         So, what have you been doing with 
                         yourself...
                              (checking resume)
                         ...the last few years?

                                     MATT
                              (to Burke)
                         I'm real bad at interviews, so, if 
                         you don't mind, I'd really prefer to 
                         just read first.

                                     BURKE
                         That's the way you want to do it?

                                     MATT
                         Yes.

                                     BURKE
                         Maybe we shouldn't even read. I'll 
                         just take your word that you're good.

               Matt smiles.

                                     BURKE
                         No. I'm serious. There's all different 
                         ways. Did you know Woody Allen never 
                         reads actors? He just looks at them, 
                         feels around a little and then decides 
                         who he wants. That's his way. Doesn't 
                         hear them do a line. I also have a 
                         way. What I do is interview first--
                         then read--maybe do it all over again 
                         the next day. I call up people the 
                         actor has worked with--check him 
                         out. If he's famous, I do an opinion 
                         survey to test how much people like 
                         him. If he's not famous, I put him 
                         on tape and show it to everyone I 
                         can grab. I believe in screen tests; 
                         I believe in replacing if the dailies 
                         are bad, in cutting people out if 
                         the previews aren't there. Because 
                         I'm not doing movies for theaters 
                         where they serve cappucino in the 
                         lobby. I'm doing popcorn movies. You 
                         want to know what I like? Come to my 
                         house, look at my lamps... you won't 
                         find it in my movies. In my movies, 
                         you'll find out what I know. I know 
                         how to do detail. What I don't know, 
                         I discover. Yesterday we finished 
                         mixing a movie--the last scene is in 
                         a field of windmills which blows up 
                         and all the blades of these windmills 
                         slice through the air, one of which 
                         hits a four-story tank of propane 
                         gas. A humongous explosion scene. I 
                         kept on saying 'louder', and they 
                         finally said to me they couldn't go 
                         louder without distortion. We went 
                         louder. We had to discover a thing, 
                         a filter, but we went louder. I don't 
                         question doing these things. I do 
                         them. So if you want to know if it's 
                         okay to do it differently--not to 
                         talk--to just read first... I say...
                              (pointing to John 
                              Earl)
                         Ask him--he's the director.

                                     JOHN EARL
                         Whatever.

                                     BURKE
                         Okay, let's do it. Do you have any 
                         questions?

                                     MATT
                         They only gave me these two pages. 
                         I'd like to give this my best shot. 
                         So if I could read the script and 
                         come back...

                                     BURKE
                         This part works tomorrow.

                                     MATT
                         Oh. Who will I be reading with?

               Burke indicates Martin.

                                     MATT
                              (from his chair)
                         Can I read from here?

                                     BURKE
                         I want you to do it wherever you're 
                         comfortable, but I'd prefer it if 
                         you were comfortable standing up.

               Matt rises uncomfortably. A SECRETARY enters and hands a 
               note to the director.

                                     JOHN EARL
                         Time for my buns to have visitors.

               Matt looks astonished as the director leaves the room.

                                     BURKE
                              (to Matt)
                         Go ahead.

                                     MATT
                         Go ahead? The director left.

                                     BURKE
                         That's okay, he trusts me, uh... And 
                         we're just doing the first page.

                                     MARTIN
                              (cueing him badly)
                         'Okay, darling Harry, here it is... 
                         If someone were breaking up with me, 
                         I'd like it short and sweet. What 
                         about you?'

                                     MATT
                              (reading--showing 
                              pain)
                         'Incredibly drawn out...'

                                     MARTIN
                         'I can't take care of you right now. 
                         What am I, your mother?'

                                     MATT
                              (intense)
                         'Well, what am I? Your duck?'

               As he gets into the scene he begins to experience some release 
               of the desperate feelings he's been harboring.

                                     MATT
                              (again)
                         'We've been together two years and 
                         you act like all you're doing is 
                         blowing away some feathers. So what 
                         I'm asking...'

                                     BURKE
                         You didn't do the quack.

                                     MATT
                         Huh?

                                     BURKE
                         The stage direction says for him to 
                         quack.

                                     MATT
                         I know, but why would he quack when 
                         someone's breaking up with him?

                                     BURKE
                         Hopefully because it's funny.

                                     MATT
                         This isn't a comedy.

                                     BURKE
                         Then we're in trouble, because they're 
                         already fall down laughing at the 
                         teaser-trailer in fifty-two hundred 
                         and thirty theaters.

                                     MATT
                         A comedy?
                              (rubbing his face)
                         I think I have to make an adjustment 
                         here.

               INT. CATHY'S OFFICE - DAY

               We HEAR the strains of the theme of a past hit movie coming 
               from Cathy's cassette player. A rack of soundtracks clearly 
               visible. Cathy is frowning as she reads the last of the galley 
               pages. She overhears some conversation in the adjoining room 
               which begins to disturb her concentration.

                                     FEMALE D PERSON (O.S.)
                         I'm not supposed to read TV pilots. 
                         Don't call us D-Girls. We're 
                         Development Persons!

               Cathy closes the door, shutting her off. She now begins to 
               fill out a form with a felt-tipped pen. As she does so, the 
               pad is supered on the screen--action seen through it. As she 
               writes, we see the notations on the super.

               It is marked COVERAGE--CONFIDENTIAL FROM: CATHY BRESLOW. TO: 
               BURKE ADLER. SUBJECT: (the pen writes out) "LITTLE DICK" 
               GENRE/CATEGORY (the pen writes out ACTION-ADVENTURE). Then 
               there are columns to check EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, POOR for 
               the story. CHARACTERS, DIALOGUE... The pen checks FAIR for 
               story, POOR for all else, CHARACTER, DIALOGUE, etc. The form 
               then states--CHECK ONE OF THE FOLLOWING SENTENCES:

               I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROJECT 
               I RECOMMEND THIS PROJECT 
               I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PROJECT 
               I'D STAKE MY ALL ON THIS PROJECT 
               I'D GLADLY STAKE MY ALL ON THIS PROJECT

               The phone rings. As she picks it up and reaches to turn down 
               the volume of the motion picture soundtrack she's listening 
               to.

                                     CATHY
                              (into phone)
                         Hi. I just finished. I'll have my 
                         coverage right over. It's past 
                         derivative... it's photocopying. 
                         What a hoot! You're kidding, right? 
                         There is truly active bidding for 
                         this book? Really? 2.3 million? Okay, 
                         see you.

               She hangs up and begins to alter the form changing the 
               STORY/POOR to STORY/EXCELLENT, and all the other POORS to 
               GOOD... and now the Recommend section.

               INSERT

               The pen is poised.

               ON CATHY

               Her soul is poised. A beat and she allows "I DO NOT RECOMMEND" 
               to stand, the source music theme--"CHARIOTS OF FIRE"--
               coincidentally celebrates this considerable act of heroism. 
               Cathy takes the sheet and walks to the door.

               INT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY

               As she approaches her secretary's desk, she overhears two 
               other members of Burke's Development Staff (a 27-year-old 
               well-dressed man and a woman younger than Cathy) as they 
               enthuse.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                         Even the title "Little Dick"--it 
                         means so many things.

                                     FEMALE D PERSON
                         Story, story, story, story, story.
                              (seeing Cathy)
                         You loved it, right?

                                     CATHY
                         I had some problems.

                                     FEMALE D PERSON
                         Like what?

                                     CATHY
                         Well, you know, it's a little 
                         garbagey.

                                     FEMALE D PERSON
                         So it has to be cast right.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                         If Cathy doesn't like it, we know 
                         it's a smash.

                                     CATHY
                              (stung)
                         Hey. It's not like I didn't recommend 
                         it.

               She surreptitiously changes her "recommend" as Matt enters. 
               She looks up.

                                     CATHY
                         How'd it go?

                                     MATT
                         I didn't get it. He did say something 
                         about wanting me back.

                                     CATHY
                         Good. His saver is he means what he 
                         says.

                                     MATT
                         Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks.

               She nods and starts to turn back towards her office.

                                     MATT
                         ...and I wanted to ask you out.

               The other people in the office stare at Matt.

                                     CATHY
                              (turns)
                         For when?

                                     MATT
                         Any time.

                                     CATHY
                         I never know when I'm free.
                              (Matt nods)
                         It sounds like I'm just... but it's 
                         true.

                                     MATT
                         Okay. Thanks again. I felt funny 
                         asking.

                                     CATHY
                         Well, don't please.

                                     MATT
                         I meant asking you to get me the 
                         audition.

                                     CATHY
                         Oh... well, don't please.

               He nods and starts to go. She looks at him.

                                     CATHY
                         Don't be sad.

               Matt smiles in astonishment and exits.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                         Who is he?

                                     CATHY
                         Oh, I was auditing this acting course 
                         and he filled in teaching one night. 
                         He did a scene himself and he was 
                         awesome. For some reason, he can't 
                         get arrested.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                         Yeah. He does seem to have a layer 
                         of loser dust on him.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Matt drives his faded, seven-year-old car into view.

               INT./EXT. MATT'S CAR - EARLY EVENING

               He looks off... sees something that arrests his interest and 
               pulls to the curb. It's a curious sight.

               MATT'S POV

               Burke Adler, standing at a street corner, palpably in pain. 
               He's trying to rein in his emotions, sucking in huge gulps 
               of air... and, then, a wave of emotion gets the better of 
               him as he looks at his watch. A sob escapes him--shocked 
               that he's so close to tears on a public street corner, he 
               battles for control... another sob as he looks to the heavens.

               ON MATT

               A split second to consider, then he's out of his car.

               FULL SHOT - THE STREET CORNER

               A flow of PEOPLE--in the foreground, the tortured figure of 
               Burke Adler--in the background, Matt Hobbs, pauses before 
               intruding. But Burke's spectacle is growing more public, 
               sounds of anguish escape him.

               CLOSER SHOT - BURKE

                                     BURKE
                         Oh, God... why? Why?...
                              (louder)
                         What am I going to do?

               And now he begins to dissassemble, openly crying--on the 
               verge of a complete breakdown. Matt moves into frame, grabbing 
               Burke, trying to provide him with an anchor.

               CLOSE ON MATT

               His face--his eyes providing a beacon of strength.

                                     MATT
                         Hey. Hey! HEY!!

               ON BURKE

               Totally fucked-up, wild-eyed. As he witnesses his own state.

                                     BURKE
                         Look at me. You'd think I was a 
                         writer.
                              (his story of travail 
                              pours from him)
                         I hired this kid as a production 
                         assistant. His father's a business 
                         manager... a few good clients.

                                     MATT
                         What happened?

                                     BURKE
                         He's been driving for me two weeks... 
                         all he has to do is pick me up on 
                         time... he's twenty minutes late and 
                         I have a test screening in the valley. 
                         Everybody's gone from the office.

               Burke flails at himself as Matt looks at him.

                                     MATT
                         Is that it? You need a lift?

                                     BURKE
                         Yeah.

                                     MATT
                         I'm right over here.

               Matt starts to lead him back, then realizes he's alone, Burke 
               having seen his car finally arrive.

               MATT'S POV

               Burke, berating the YOUNG DRIVER. Matt pauses, awed by the 
               wild gesticulating--the few screamed words...

                                     BURKE (O.S.)
                         ...Not just today... believe me, 
                         there's no way you'll ever make it... 
                         You are going to fail. Listen, listen--
                         I know about this; you are going to 
                         be a failure.

               CAMERA FOLLOWING MATT

               As he joins Burke and the young man, Burke turns to Matt.

                                     BURKE
                              (to Matt)
                         Let's get moving; you said you'd 
                         give me a lift.

                                     MATT
                         What the hell are you talking about? 
                         Not in your car... I've got my own.

                                     BURKE
                         I'll give you a hundred and twenty 
                         dollars to take me... and it will 
                         still be a favor.
                              (to Young Man)
                         Get out. Come on.
                              (to Matt)
                         Please. This is very important.

               The driver gets out.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (final plea)
                         A guy got shot on the freeway... 
                         Traffic's tied up.

                                     BURKE
                         You should leave time for that kind 
                         of thing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BURKE'S CAR

                                     MATT
                         What do you need me for? Don't you 
                         drive?

                                     BURKE
                              (a mumble)
                         Yeah, I drive. I don't like to look 
                         for parking.

               EXT. GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY - EARLY EVENING

               The sun setting on a nondescript slab of California.

               INT. BURKE'S CAR - EARLY EVENING

               The two men... Matt feeling very peculiar in this line of 
               work. Burke's tension renders him arresting, handsome even. 
               The look of generals who go forth against long odds. He takes 
               an enormous cleansing breath. It startles Matt.

                                     BURKE
                              (explaining)
                         Yoga shit. I feel like barbed wire. 
                         I don't know if you keep track, but 
                         I'm the sixth independent producer 
                         ever to have two big pictures 
                         scheduled for Christmas, and tonight 
                         we're testing the first one for the 
                         first time... You get it?

                                     MATT
                         Yeah. It's important to you.

                                     BURKE
                              (laughing at the 
                              understatement)
                         Yes. I don't think I would have put 
                         it that way... but, yes...

               EXT. MALL - EARLY EVENING

               Burke's car moves toward the movie complex.

               BURKE'S POV

               Our first view of NAN MULHANNEY; middle-aged and pragmatic, 
               yet extraordinarily naive. She's a scientist of sorts--
               monitoring the tastes and feelings of Americans, first in 
               Washington and now here. Though she just had a very rough 
               hour or so, she bends down to smile at Burke.

               INT. BURKE'S CAR

                                     BURKE
                         Keep driving. She runs the test 
                         screenings. Very smart. Very. She 
                         has a real case on me, but so far 
                         I've been keeping it in the bank.

               He stops talking, stops breathing, as he sees.

               BURKE'S POV - THE TEST AUDIENCE

               The line consists of disparate, disinterested people who are 
               focused on their own small, personal dramas--not at all 
               cognizant of the fact that they hold a life in their hands. 
               They are clearly growing impatient.

               INT. CAR

                                     BURKE
                         Go very slow.

               MUSIC IN... Burke steels himself and exits the car.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - LATE DAY

                                     NAN
                         We're 34 minutes late. The studio is 
                         appropriately wild... people are 
                         beginning to leave... but I knew how 
                         upset you'd be if we started without 
                         you.

                                     BURKE
                              (distantly)
                         Yeah. Thanks.

               But he pays her no mind as MUSIC CONTINUES and he moves 
               towards the line. Nan approaches the car.

                                     NAN
                         How is he tonight?

                                     MATT
                         I don't know him, so I have nothing 
                         to compare it to.

                                     NAN
                         Well, how would you say he is, anyway?

                                     MATT
                         Not quite himself.

               ANGLE ON BURKE

               As he approaches the line, he BEGINS TO SING his love to 
               them, "I'll Do Anything." As he pours out his misdirected 
               heart to individuals on the line who DO NOT HEAR HIM.

               ANGLE ON LINE

               Their impatience gives rise to a VERY SLOW TAP DANCE, each 
               couple or cluster doing it differently--barely exaggerating 
               the normal shifting of a line... As BURKE CONTINUES TO SING... 
               the song builds as does the dance... Burke sings even more 
               passionately, his D-PEOPLE perhaps joining in as BACKGROUND 
               SINGERS. At a key point, the disparate groups turn and form 
               a SOLID UNIFIED LINE. They begin the rhythmic clapping of 
               impatience--having become a line, they now threaten to become 
               a mob. Burke sings one more Joe Cocker-like passionate plea 
               before turning to camera to shout over the mayhem:

                                     BURKE
                         Let them in.

               As they enter.

               INT. MOVIE THEATER - EVENING

               Nan is addressing the audience from down front.

                                     NAN
                         The name of the picture you'll be 
                         seeing is 'Ground Zero'... There may 
                         be some scratches... some of the 
                         colors may be off, there are no final 
                         titles, and it has not been finally 
                         mixed for sound, and the music is 
                         temp, that means temporary...

               As she says this:

               ANGLE ON REAR OF HOUSE

               Where Burke spies the STUDIO HEAD and leaves Matt's side.

               ON STUDIO HEAD

               As BURKE enters the frame behind him. He is right behind his 
               boss' ear. He leans in and offers an intimacy.

                                     BURKE
                         I'm glad you came yourself instead 
                         of sending your staff.

               The boss is startled--jumps. BURKE eyes him... there must be 
               some way to profit from these stolen moments with a powerful 
               man.

                                     BURKE
                         I wouldn't be surprised if tonight's 
                         screening is a monster.
                              (emphatically)
                         Could happen, right?

                                     STUDIO HEAD
                         Sure.

                                     BURKE
                         Okay.

               He moves back to Matt and Nan at the rear of the audience.

                                     BURKE
                              (to Matt)
                         Eisner just said he thinks the 
                         screening will be a monster.

               Strangely, Burke seems truly buoyed by the words of 
               encouragement he himself manufactured. He moves down three 
               rows and sits in an aisle seat just as the film opens with a 
               series of violent explosions.

               CLOSE ON NAN

                                     NAN
                         Please, God, let tonight give him 
                         peace.

               Incredibly, Burke turns and gestures to her that the sound 
               of her small voice is interfering with the cacophony of his 
               movie. Nan is clearly stricken by her lapse as she whispers 
               to Matt.

                                     NAN
                         We're short two card-counters, can 
                         you two help out?

               INT. MOVIE THEATER - 1:47:20 LATER

               We are seeing one of the final moments of the film.

               INT. WHOLESALE BUTCHER'S (THE FILM) - DAY

               As the muscular hero moves with stealth through the giant 
               refrigerated meat door. He passes cows and dead men hanging 
               from alternate hooks. Suddenly, he is attacked by the villain 
               brandishing an electric meat dismembering tool. The hero 
               ducks, the machine ripping apart hanging cow flesh. The hero 
               grabs the only weapon he can find: a large piece of meat on 
               a large bone, which he uses as a mace. He clubs the other 
               man--then again--and again. Part of the audience is whooping 
               and applauding.

               QUICK SHOT OF NAN

               Standing with Matt and Cathy. At the sound of the applause, 
               Nan grins and mumbles with a connoisseur's knowledge.

                                     NAN
                         Males, fifteen and under.

               BACK TO SCREEN

               Where the hero stands over the man whose face he has 
               shattered, holding a club from which hang strings of meat. 
               He is breathing heavily, and between breaths, states:

                                     HERO
                         Sorry to bust your chops.

               General audience laughter.

               SERIES OF SHOTS ON NAN - FRONT OF AUDIENCE

                                     NAN
                         If you'll just stay in your seats a 
                         few moments and fill out these cards 
                         for us...

               ON AISLES

               Matt and others handing out cards with pencils attached... 
               Folks filling them out. As an ADOLESCENT MALE fills it out; 
               PREVIEW CARD FILLS THE SCREEN as we view LIVE ACTION THROUGH 
               IT.

               INT. THEATER MANAGER'S OFFICE

               An office meant for two, containing twenty counters. The 
               counting is done with erasers rifling stacks, creating a 
               sound, a MUSICAL RHYTHM, as the GROUP CAPTAIN calls out with 
               gospel cadence.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                         Who has young males? Young women? 
                         Older males?... Older males?...

               Matt, his tally finished, squats on the floor, waiting. The 
               Group Captain approaches.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                         Older males... older males?

               Matt looks blank.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                              (again)
                         Older males... over 25?

               Matt now realizes that it is his category and hands over the 
               older male cards and exits.

               INT. THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

               Burke, prowling the lobby as audience stragglers leave and 
               Studio Execs and Popcorn Development Staff wait. He looks 
               off to see Matt and Nan chatting in another part of the lobby.

               ON MATT AND NAN

               As they arrive... Nan looks off to see the Group Captain 
               approach.

                                     NAN
                         How long since you've seen your 
                         daughter?

                                     MATT
                         A little over two years.
                              (on her look)
                         My wife insisted on moving back to 
                         the Midwest--then I was in the 
                         Philippines on the mini-series and...

                                     NAN
                              (suddenly and loudly)
                         Oh, please. It's one thing being a 
                         son-of-a-bitch, but you don't have 
                         to be a stupid son-of-a-bitch. People 
                         move heaven and earth to see their 
                         kids. I don't care if she moved to 
                         Pluto, it's abandonment.

                                     MATT
                              (a pause, then)
                         Hey, we just met.

                                     NAN
                              (realizing)
                         Oh. Sorry.

                                     BURKE
                         Make a guess how we did.

                                     NAN
                         It wouldn't mean anything.

                                     BURKE
                         Nothing good that happens can make 
                         it worth feeling the way I do now. 
                         Nothing.

               An OLDER WOMAN approaches them.

                                     OLDER WOMAN
                         Excuse me.

                                     BURKE
                         Who the hell are you? This is private.

                                     OLD LADY
                         I'm Mr. Eisner's mother.

                                     BURKE
                         Oh. Can I get you some water?

                                     OLD LADY
                         No, thank you.

               The Group Captain approaches and hands Nan a sheet.

               FULL SHOT

               Everyone, all the studio and Popcorn staff, is drawn to Nan.

               ON NAN

               As she glances at the figures.

               ON NAN'S LEFT HAND

               As she secretly reaches for and holds Burke's hand. Is it in 
               sympathy or congratulations?

               TIGHT ON STUDIO EXECUTIVE FACES

               As we see in ever-so-SLOWED ACTIONS, tense lips turning 
               gloriously upward to reveal gums--then a smile. More smiles 
               as we pan across teeth... bonded executives and bonded teeth. 
               The shot widens. The studio head mumbles to himself as he 
               carefully goes over the tally in every category. Then:

                                     STUDIO HEAD
                         I don't need the numbers. I loved 
                         it.

               His smiling face takes us:

                                     NAN
                         Burke, ninety in the top two boxes.

               TO BURKE

               A tear in his eye--a smile shyer than others. He turns to 
               the old lady, instinctively using this victory to settle his 
               most recent score as he says mockingly:

                                     BURKE
                         Now can I get you some water?

               EXT. THEATER - NIGHT

               Cathy and Matt are leaning against Burke's car. Cathy is 
               distraught--temporarily, but horribly, unsure of herself. 
               Matt is looking at her. If he had a little more confidence 
               going for him right now, he would make his move. But, for 
               now, they are two self-doubters on different trips.

                                     CATHY
                         I never thought it would do this 
                         well. There were so many holes; I 
                         told everybody it wasn't going to do 
                         business. Why am I so public with my 
                         opinions?

                                     MATT
                         You might be right.

                                     CATHY
                         Not with that score. You know, maybe 
                         tonight's the night I'm losing my 
                         entire mind, but weren't you in 
                         'Platoon?'

                                     MATT
                         Incredible. I was only there for a 
                         minute in the rape scene, moving 
                         past Charlie Sheen when I left the 
                         hut... I had a great scene cut out... 
                         I was...

                                     CATHY
                         But there was that one long close up--
                         where you seemed ashamed of yourself 
                         but still arrogant.

                                     MATT
                         That's exactly what I was going for.

                                     CATHY
                         It reminded me of my last boyfriend.
                              (indicating book bag)
                         Got to go.

               She hefts the bag--puts it back down--crosses her eyes, 
               burlesquing the weight of the bag. He helps her put it on 
               her shoulder.

                                     MATT
                         You have to read all that?

                                     CATHY
                         Beast of burden.

                                     MATT
                              (sincerely)
                         So what are you, totally wonderful 
                         or what?

               She smiles and is gone, staggering a bit under the weight of 
               her scripts. Matt looks after her. Burke and Nan approach.

                                     BURKE
                         How come you haven't said anything? 
                         This is great, right?

                                     NAN
                         No.

                                     BURKE
                         What no?

                                     NAN
                         The definite recommends are way off 
                         for a score this high and, even for 
                         action-adventure, it's just too low 
                         for women.
                              (Burke looks anguished)
                         I'm sorry.

               He leans against the car for support.

                                     BURKE
                         It was such a good score.

                                     NAN
                              (extraordinarily 
                              sympathetic)
                         I know... And, unfortunately, 
                         yesterday's tracking wasn't...

                         I'm sorry... They just don't seem in 
                         the mood for action-adventure right...

                         Sorry... May I tell you one more 
                         thing?
                              (he looks up in 
                              anticipatory fear)
                         I think it's so wonderful that you 
                         don't worry about even trying to act 
                         strong.

                         sometime?

                         Good. I'll call you.

               As Burke moves to his car. He SEES the Group Captain paying 
               Matt.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                         Thirty-two, thirty-three.

               Burke is looking at Matt with some surprise.

                                     BURKE
                         You want to do this regularly for 
                         me? I was gonna offer, but I thought 
                         it would humiliate you.

                                     MATT
                              (straight at him)
                         I don't mind an occasional odd job. 
                         But I can't work tomorrow. I have to 
                         get my kid.

               As they get in the car, Burke has the front door open, about 
               to get in--reconsiders, and gets in the rear door.

                                     BURKE
                         Okay, I got the cards to look at--I 
                         think I'll ride back here.
                              (to Nan)
                         Maybe I'll drop by your place 
                         tomorrow.

               Matt gets behind the wheel, thereby ending the day as a full-
               fledged chauffeur. They drive off.

               EXT. CORRIDOR - DAY

                         were like when you weren't working. 
                         There was absolutely no difference. 
                         You want to see where we do the

               Matt, wearing earphones, is in the middle of a row of five, 
               intent on what he is watching.

               MATT'S POV

               A recent example of a great actor in a regular movie... 
               something like Brando in "The Freshman." No sound.

               ON MATT

               Watching intently. Not watching--studying... not studying--
               fully appreciating. Now he sees a particularly good moment--
               looks around joyously for half a beat--a reflex to share 
               what he saw. His neighbors, not quite knowing what he's 
               smiling at; he returns his attention to the screen.

               knocks on the door. A MAN answers.

               He lights a cigarette, takes three quick drags, then flicks 
               it away before walking inside behind Matt.

               March coming home from the wars and seeing his wife just a 
               beat before she sees him. Here we have a wretched mutant of 
               that moment. Beth, still fierce and attractive, is packing 
               her daughter's suitcase when she senses him and looks up.

                                     BETH'S VOICE
                         Okay, listen carefully, Jeannie. Be 
                         still. Now, what's the most important 
                         thing in life to know?

                                     JEANNIE
                         No one will ever love me as much as 
                         you do.

               Matt and the Marshal exchange a look of mutual horror.

                                     BETH
                         Good. Now, concentrate with all your 
                         muscles and remember everything I'm 
                         about to say to you...

               The Marshal and Matt shift uncomfortably.

                                     BETH
                         Don't talk to strangers. They may be 
                         killers. Take your vitamins so the 
                         poison in the food can't hurt you. 
                         What else now?

                                     JEANNIE'S VOICE
                         Teeth.

                                     BETH'S VOICE
                         Right. Thank you. Brush right after 
                         you eat or your gums will start to 
                         bleed in your sleep and choke you.

               The Marshal and Matt can stand no more--they each call to 
               her... "Beth... Beth... Mrs. Hobbs... Beth." She looks out 
               and then walks to them.

                                     BETH
                         What? I'm giving Jeannie her 
                         reminders.

                                     MATT
                         Reminders?!? You can't say things 
                         like that to a little...

                                     BETH
                         No. Don't. No. Don't dare. Don't 
                         criticize the way I mother or I think 
                         I'll start to scream and never st...

                                     MARSHAL
                         Mrs. Hobbs.

                                     BETH
                              (suddenly cheery)
                         Yes.

                                     MARSHAL
                         You know, I've been involved with 
                         this sort of thing for a long time.

                                     BETH
                         You're not going to criticize me, 
                         are you? Not in front of him--because 
                         all he's done is send Jeannie these 
                         long, stupid letters. He doesn't 
                         even realize she can't read. He sends 
                         letters to someone who can't read.
                              (laughs)
                         It's almost funny.

                                     MATT
                         I thought you'd read them to her.

                                     BETH
                              (realizing)
                         Oh.

                                     MARSHAL
                         I'm not faulting you. You love your 
                         daughter and this is a very tough 
                         thing to go through. You feel guilty 
                         and caring and it all gets mixed up 
                         so that there's so much important 
                         stuff going down that there's no 
                         sure way of dealing with it, but the 
                         best thing you can do is just make 
                         sure you love her.

                                     BETH
                         Typical cop talk.
                              (on his look)
                         But I understand what you're trying 
                         to say. Thank you. Can I have another 
                         minute with her?

               She returns to the doorway which still only provides us with 
               glimpses as she SINGS, "DON'T TALK TO STRANGERS." The CAMERA 
               MOVES down the hallway to INTRODUCE JEANNIE, trying to puzzle 
               things out as she sits amongst a ridiculous number of 
               suitcases.

               INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY

               As the two females who bear his name approach. Matt doesn't 
               want a pregnant first moment with Jeannie, so he wards off 
               silence with chatter. Unfortunately, he can only think of 
               one word.

                                     MATT
                         Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (laughing mirthlessly)
                         Hello, monster-poop.

                                     MATT
                              (to U.S. Marshal)
                         She has her mother's sense of humor.

               Beth stops him with a look, then bends down.

                                     BETH
                         Okay, love, Mommy's going to help 
                         others who need her for a few years, 
                         and you're going with Daddy as I 
                         explained.
                              (to Marshal and Matt)
                         We'll all have to help with the 
                         luggage.

               EXT. BETH'S HOUSE - DAY - LONG SHOT

               All three adults and Jeannie sharing the burden of the luggage 
               as they move towards the cab. Mother and child hug. Matt 
               struck by his child's plight, him.

                                     BETH
                              (turning to Matt)
                         Beginning now, you must give less 
                         value to your own happiness and well-
                         being, then hopefully, you will reach 
                         the point where you give that no 
                         value whatsoever. Give her everything. 
                         There's no such thing as spoiling a 
                         child.

                                     MAN
                         Even if you have to steal to do it?

                                     BETH
                         You don't really want to mess with 
                         me, do you?

                                     MAN
                              (simple honesty)
                         No.

                                     MATT
                              (to Jeannie)
                         Okay, sweetie. We have to go.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (to Beth)
                         I want to go with you.

                                     BETH
                         Can't, pretty-heart. I'm sorry.

               Tears fall from Jeannie's eyes.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Not even a compromise?

                                     BETH
                              (thinking)
                         The compromise will be that you don't 
                         have to ride in back; you can ride 
                         up front with the driver... okay?

                                     MATT
                         What?

                                     JEANNIE
                         Okay.

               As Beth buckles Jeannie into the front seat, Matt gets in 
               the back, alone, feeling preposterous. Beth nods to the 
               Marshal, who surreptitiously handcuffs her.

                                     MATT
                              (to driver)
                         Can we please go?

               SHOT - JEANNIE

               The cab pulls away. Matt leans towards her as she looks back 
               at the receding figure of her mother and grows still.

               ON MOTHER AND MARSHALL

               As she sings him one last line of "DON'T TALK TO STRANGERS."

               EXT. SIDEWALK AREA - DAY

               Matt checks Jeannie's luggage, then takes her hand. She lets 
               him. He is grateful.

                                     MATT
                         It's going to be okay. I'm you're 
                         dad, you know? So it will be okay. 
                         You and I will make it okay. You 
                         ever ridden in a plane before?

                                     JEANNIE
                              (a sudden gust of 
                              anger)
                         Yesssss!

               INT. PLANE - DAY

               Jeannie and Matt in the center two seats of a five seat row. 
               Jeannie is coloring in a book which Matt bought her; he is 
               holding some extra crayons.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Don't stare at me.

                                     MATT
                         Sorry.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I want to put on my yellow dress 
                         now.

                                     MATT
                         It's underneath the plane. We can't 
                         get it.

               And just that quick, Jeannie screams.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I want to put on my dress. I want to 
                         put on my dress.

               Other passengers turn around. This is pretty raw stuff we're 
               into. Temper in all its wildness, MUSIC UNDER... electric 
               guitar beginning to match the energy and naked emotion of 
               the child.

                                     MATT
                         There's no way we can get the dress--
                         it's impossible.

               Jeannie's feet start kicking in front of her--the person in 
               that seat turning sharply around.

                                     MATT
                         Don't kick the seat!

                                     JEANNIE
                         I want the yellow dress.
                              (a shriek)
                         Give me a compromise.

               She is crying now.

                                     MATT
                         As soon as we land. That's the 
                         compromise.

               MORE MUSIC

               Without warning, Jeannie slaps herself in the face. All five 
               people in the row ahead turn and say in unison:

                                     WOMEN IN ROW
                         Don't hit her.

                                     MATT
                         God, I didn't hit her--she hit her.

               ANGLE ON LIGHTS

               As everyone starts pushing the cabin attendant call button. 
               These dings magnify until they're part of the music--as it 
               drives and drives... Matt takes Jeannie's hand and tries to 
               restrain her.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Noooooo. Let go of me. Noooo. The 
                         yellow dress... let go... let go.

               She breaks away from him. He moves after her.

               CAMERA MOVING

               At breakneck speed, Jeannie dashes through the plane with 
               her father in pursuit... flashes of disapproving faces. The 
               seat belt sign goes on. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT blocks his path.

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         You'll have to sit down.

               Jeannie takes advantage of Matt's being stopped and moves 
               into the toilet, locking the door behind her.

                                     MATT
                              (yelling)
                         Jeannie, we have to sit down. Please.

                                     CAPTAIN'S VOICE
                         We'll be having some turbulence for 
                         the next twenty minutes or so. Will 
                         the cabin attendants please take 
                         their seats?

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         Sir.

                                     MATT
                              (simply and utterly)
                         I have no idea what to do.

               A sudden bump and Matt falls. He yells to the locked door.

                                     MATT
                         Jeannie, you okay?

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         Go back to your seat. I'll get her.

               As Matt makes his way back, the Flight Attendant uses a hidden 
               latch to open the door. Music building--then calming, the 
               worst is over. Matt makes his way back to his seat, shell-
               shocked. The Attendant leans over him.

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         She wants to be alone. So we're 
                         upgrading her.

               He just nods.

               FULL SHOT

               Down the aisle--Jeannie lets an Attendant lead her as she 
               peers back at her dad.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Matt carrying the sleeping child like a sack over his 
               shoulder, also managing to hold onto all her luggage.

               INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               He has propped her on the sofa, a cotton nightgown out. He 
               is unbuttoning her dress. She opens her eyes, the window's 
               protective bars PLACING A SHADOW ACROSS HER FACE. She attempts 
               to cover her fear.

                                     JEANNIE
                         These are the wrong jammies.

                                     MATT
                         Okay... so what do we do?

               Jeannie mimics him perfectly under her breath. She goes to 
               an open suitcase and throws things on the floor until she 
               finds the right jammies.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Where do I sleep?

                                     MATT
                         I have a sleeping bag and bed. Which 
                         one do you want?

               She surveys her pitiful choice; then points to the sleeping 
               bag.

                                     JEANNIE
                         That.

               She gets into it. He zips her up--then she says something 
               remarkably unexpected.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Hug.

               Amazed, Matt hugs her. A half-beat, then:

                                     JEANNIE
                              (sharply)
                         Let go.

               He does--then stands and looks down at her. She looks back, 
               mocking his stare with one of her own.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Nan uncertainly enters this decidedly masculine bathroom. 
               She is wearing an evening gown. The sun streams through the 
               lush foliage outside a wall-sized window. MUSIC as she opens 
               her purse and removes a pillbox; at one point lightly singing 
               a snatch of lyric concerning the conflicts of being a single 
               woman and a single mother--this while totally focused on the 
               pills.

               INSERT - PILL BOX

               A major movie shot of this compartmentalized box. Each 
               burrowed nest clearly labeled for the pill it contains: 
               VITAMIN B, VITAMIN A, OSCILLOCOCCINUM, PROZAC, CALCIUM, TEST 
               DRUG, ASPIRIN, XANAX, ETC.

               ON NAN

               MUSIC CONTINUES. She dials a phone number while arching her 
               neck and swallowing one pill after another with little swigs 
               of water. This process continuing, even as she speaks into 
               the phone.

                                     NAN
                         Monica--is Leslie up yet? Good. I 
                         didn't want you to get worried when 
                         you realized I wasn't there. I'm 
                         still with that man. I'll tell you 
                         about it later. But it's sure nice 
                         to have wobbly legs again. Look, 
                         today's recycling day for Leslie at 
                         school, so give her some empty cans... 
                         well, then dump some out for her! 
                         Tell her I had to leave real early 
                         for work and I'll pick her up at 
                         school myself to make up for it and 
                         we'll rent any cassette she wants 
                         for tonight. Thank you... Take good 
                         care.

               She hangs up. Another snatch of lyric as she bends to brush 
               her teeth with her finger; prepares herself and opens the 
               door to greet her new lover.

               INT. BURKE'S MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

               Burke sits on the edge of the bed, fearful. He sees her.

                                     BURKE
                         Oh, I thought you took off in the 
                         middle of the night.

               She moves quickly to him.

                                     NAN
                         No. I just had to call home. Is that 
                         why you're sad?

                                     BURKE
                         No. It's Everett. This kid who used 
                         to work for me. He was always crazy 
                         to do his own movie.

                                     NAN
                              (fearing worst)
                         What happened?

                                     BURKE
                              (very down)
                         His movie not only opened to a three 
                         million dollar Friday--it's gotten 
                         great reviews.

               Nan is dumbfounded; still she puts a hand on him, actually 
               consoling him for his hideous thought--Hollywood lovers: he, 
               wrapped up with ill thoughts of others; she, feeling intimate, 
               yet severely compromised. Cupid's work is done.

                                     BURKE
                              (again)
                         Listen. I'm tremendously worried 
                         about 'Ground Zero' because of the 
                         bad 'want to sees' you sent over. 
                         But that's just me being nervous 
                         over nothing, isn't it?

                                     NAN
                         No. That's just you correctly 
                         assessing the situation. So stop 
                         being so hard on yourself.

               He eyes her, then:

               INT. MATT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

               We hear a muffled argument between Matt and Jeannie coming 
               from inside their apartment. Then the door opens and Matt, 
               holding Jeannie by the hand, moves down the hall to the next 
               door and knocks. (NOTE: Jeannie is dressed in layers of varied 
               clothing--some of the layers play clothes, some fit for a 
               coronation. She is a pocket contemporary Annie Hall... her 
               style so much her own it transcends judgement. Her hair is 
               unkempt. The door opens revealing Lucy, an Hispanic woman in 
               her mid-30s.

                                     MATT
                         How're you doing? I'm from next door. 
                         I see you with your kids in the 
                         laundry room...

                                     LUCY
                         Hello.
                              (seeing Jeannie, turns 
                              warmer)
                         ...Who are you?

               Jeannie is a bit shy.

                                     MATT
                         Say, 'Hello, I'm your new neighbor 
                         now too.'

               Jeannie says nothing.

                                     LUCY
                         I'm Lucy Crisala... What's your name?

               Jeannie says nothing.

                                     MATT
                         Say, 'Jeannie.'

               The form of the conversation is forged. Jeannie not answering 
               anything. Matt bending over to Jeannie while he forms her 
               answers to Lucy.

                                     LUCY
                         I have a little girl too.

                                     MATT
                         Say, 'Isn't that nice... How old is 
                         she?'

                                     LUCY
                         She's four and a half and I have a 
                         little boy who is not yet one year.

                                     MATT
                         Say, 'That's nice... I'd like to 
                         play with them... My Daddy didn't 
                         know your phone number, so we just 
                         decided to...'

                                     LUCY
                              (interrupting)
                         What can I do for you?

                                     MATT
                         Say 'Daddy has to go to work tonight 
                         and...'
                              (catching himself and 
                              looks directly at 
                              Lucy)
                         I need someone to help me and her on 
                         short notice. I've seen your around 
                         with your kids and hoped you knew 
                         someone in the building or close by. 
                         I've got this new job that starts 
                         now. Do you know anyone?

                                     LUCY
                         Well, I'm always here. I could maybe 
                         do it myself.

                                     MATT
                              (there is a God and a 
                              good one at that)
                         Oh, this is so great. Let's work out 
                         a full-time schedule and...

                                     LUCY
                         Wait. Jeannie, why don't you come in 
                         for a minute and meet Ricky and Essa. 
                         Come on, we're making fruit bars.

               Jeannie walks into the apartment past her father.

                                     LUCY
                              (again, to Matt)
                         Why don't you leave her for a while 
                         and then we talk.

                                     MATT
                         Sort of a test?

                                     LUCY
                         We'll just see how it works.

               INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Play-pen in the middle of the floor... Jeannie stands there 
               staring at Essa who is playing with her little brother. Matt 
               moves to embrace Jeannie who cranes away from him. He stays 
               with it, whispering in her ear.

                                     MATT
                         Please behave, understand? I don't 
                         know what we'll do if this doesn't 
                         work, so behave, sweetheart. Behave, 
                         behave.

               As he exits towards his own apartment.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MATT'S APT. - 20 MINUTES LATER

               Matt is extraordinarily anxious. Then he HEARS loud crying 
               and screaming from next door. There is a stab of despair. 
               Matt deflates, then resigned, exits.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               The sound of screaming now louder. He walks to Lucy's door, 
               takes a breath and knocks. The door opens and Lucy stands 
               there looking rattled.

                                     MATT
                         I'm sorry I bothered you.
                              (calling inside)
                         Jeannie...

                                     LUCY
                         Could I have her a little bit longer? 
                         My little boy just fell and Jeannie 
                         is the only one he let hold him.

               ON MATT

               A devil's weight lifted from his shoulders. The slap-happy 
               smile of the just saved plastered on his face.

                                     MATT
                         Your little boy fell, so he's 
                         screaming. And you want her to stay.

               Lucy, confused by his buoyant reaction, nods.

                                     LUCY
                         Okay. Seven dollars an hour?

                                     MATT
                         Great. Thank you. See you later, 
                         Jeannie.

               He tries to kiss her, but she shuns him. Lucy, now having an 
               official status, turns to admonish her.

                                     MATT
                         No, that's okay. I'm fine with it. I 
                         feel fine.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

               Burke walks tight little circles near Cathy and the rest of 
               his staff while a few feet away Studio Executives stand in a 
               cluster. There is a DISTANT, RHYTHMIC SHUFFLING SOUND. Burke 
               walks past Cathy.

                                     BURKE
                         Nothing good that happens tonight 
                         can make it worth feeling the way I 
                         do right now. Nothing.
                              (turning to Cathy)
                         What do you think?

                                     CATHY
                              (nervously taking the 
                              plunge)
                         To be honest, I had problems with 
                         'Ground Zero.' But this 'People Get 
                         Hurt' one, while it might not be my 
                         exact, exact thing, I think will 
                         really work for an audience. It's so 
                         over the top, you have a great time.

                                     BURKE
                         So you think it'll score big?

                                     CATHY
                         Yes.

               INT. COUNTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Where we discover the SOURCE OF THE SOUND. Some twenty card-
               counters on the floor riffling through stacks of cards with 
               erasers. Matt and Nan stand in the doorway.

                                     NAN
                         Don't worry. My daughter used to 
                         throw fits in supermarkets when we 
                         first moved here. It's all so 
                         perfectly normal. Plus I know a great 
                         psychiatric children's group.

                                     MATT
                         That's what breaks your heart. 
                         Jeannie's problem is that she's so 
                         down on herself.

                                     NAN
                         Well, she's lucky to have a daddy 
                         who cares, believe me.

                                     MATT
                         I don't know if lucky's the word. 
                         I'm hoping she's asleep when I get 
                         home so I won't have to deal with 
                         her... I'm actually afraid of my own 
                         kid.

                                     NAN
                         Oh, my. I've had exactly that feeling 
                         and never said it out loud. See, 
                         there are men who talk my language 
                         and I'm just cursed that I'm not 
                         attracted to them because they are 
                         so nice they remind me of myself.

               Matt laughs. In the b.g., the counting is completed.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                         Excellents?

                                     GIRL COUNTER
                         Seven.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                         Very goods?

                                     BOY COUNTER
                         14.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                         Fairs?

                                     SECOND BOY CARD COUNTER
                         30.

                                     GROUP CAPTAIN
                         Poors?

                                     SECOND GIRL CARD COUNTER
                         Just a second...
                              (finishes counting)
                         666.

               The Group Captain notes the figure on a sheet, walks to the 
               doorway and hands it to Nan, who is still deep into 
               conversation with Matt. She begins walking back to the theater 
               without looking at the sheet in her hand.

                                     NAN
                         I felt terrible about the way I blew 
                         up at you when I first met you.
                              (before he can object)
                         Please.

               FULL SHOT - THEATER AREA - NIGHT

               Burke and others waiting as Matt and Nan come to a stop some 
               distance away.

                                     BURKE
                         What are they doing?

                                     NAN
                         I began taking anti-depressants when 
                         we moved here from Washington. I had 
                         some small reactions--sleeping 14 
                         hours, no libido, I gained 17 pounds 
                         in nine days--that sort of thing. So 
                         they gave me pills to deal with the 
                         side effects. And then pills to deal 
                         with the side effects I was getting 
                         from those pills. All this besides 
                         the stuff the nutritionist was giving 
                         me. The combination formed some sort 
                         of potion so that I keep telling the 
                         truth. I don't have a choice. That's 
                         why I was so rude to you.

                                     MATT
                         Your doctor says this?

                                     NAN
                         Oh, yes. He's excited, but only 
                         because he sees glory for himself in 
                         it... See, ordinarily I wouldn't say 
                         that about my doctor, but I can't 
                         help it, it's the truth. He's 
                         monitoring me for a while longer 
                         before writing it up for this medical 
                         journal...

               Cathy has joined them.

                                     CATHY
                         Burke's going crazy waiting for the 
                         score.

                                     NAN
                         Coming.

                                     CATHY
                              (to Matt)
                         How are you, anyway?

               Matt shifts, figuring out his answer.

                                     CATHY
                              (a small laugh)
                         It's a tough one, huh? Me too.

               Nan looks down at the score.

                                     NAN
                         Oh, my. Matt, I'd better drive him 
                         myself.

               She starts for Burke.

               ON BURKE AND OTHERS

               As Nan arrives and hands the Studio Executives the score, 
               Burke looking over their shoulders.

                                     BURKE
                         I can fix this... Get some narration 
                         written. . .
                              (turning to Director)
                         You'll cut 30 minutes. It will come 
                         out like butter.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         We're only 77 minutes now...

                                     BURKE
                              (mumbling to himself)
                         ...a 47-minute movie... no, that 
                         won't work...

                                     FEMALE STUDIO EXEC
                         I have to go. I have a nanny problem. 
                         Priorities, right?

                                     BURKE
                         Thanks for the support.

               She kisses his cheek and leaves. A beat of silence... Burke 
               turns to Nan.

                                     BURKE
                              (again)
                         Can you help?

               Exactly the moment Nan has been waiting for... she does have 
               a valuable observation to offer at this dark moment.

                                     NAN
                         Yes, I can.

                                     BURKE
                              (hopeful)
                         Go ahead.

                                     NAN
                         It's only a movie.

               As Burke looks at her from the depths of his pain and sees 
               her confidently believing that she has imparted something of 
               value, the movie's marquee lights go off giving us a:

                                                                 BLACK OUT:

               INT. MATT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

               As he carries an enormously resistant Jeannie, wearing a 
               borrowed T-shirt nightie, back towards his apartment... Matt 
               has Jeannie under one arm--her clothes and shoes in another... 
               Jeannie's arms are extended towards Lucy, who stands in the 
               open doorway of her apartment. She begins thrashing. Giant 
               tears come--the moment is operatic.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Let go. Please, Lucy, don't make me 
                         go.

                                     MATT
                         Everyone's tired. You can come back 
                         tomorr...

                                     LUCY
                         Listen to me, Jeannie...

                                     JEANNIE
                         I want to live here with these people. 
                         God, let me live here.

                                     MATT
                         Maybe if she stayed tonight she...

                                     JEANNIE
                         I love it here so much that...

               Now her father's last words have registered on her--she 
               immediately stops crying, though tears still roll down her 
               cheeks.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Daddy says I can stay.

               Jeannie wriggles away towards Lucy's doorway. Lucy takes 
               several steps toward Matt, who obviously fears the looming 
               exchange.

                                     LUCY
                         I no think you can give her what 
                         pleases when she act like this... 
                         Because then she think...

               Matt is very much like a fighter taking a great deal of 
               punishment, knowing he is beaten, but being told by his corner 
               he must make a fight of it. He nods his head repeatedly in 
               agreement...

                                     MATT
                         I know... I know...

               Now he sniffs the air in quick rhythm, hoping to draw in 
               some courage and resolve. He moves to Jeannie.

                                     MATT
                         You'll see Lucy in the morning. We're 
                         going home.

                                     JEANNIE
                         No. I'm not! STOP!

               INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               As they enter and Matt pushes her into the other room and 
               closes the door, placing her in there alone.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Jeannie, behind the double glass-paneled doors of the bedroom.

               HER POV

               Matt, upset in a way he has never imagined, as he pops a 
               beer--puts on some headphones for calming music and begins 
               to read a book on child behavior modification.

               ON JEANNIE

               Feeling the restrictions of her punishment, pacing and now 
               she begins to wail "THIS LONELY LIFE". Few adult women have 
               sung with such appropriate passion out of need and loss, 
               aloneness and confusion. The song finishes. Jeannie sits 
               huddled.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

               This rooftop serves as an outdoor commissary for Popcorn 
               Pictures. There are a few tables, snack machines and 
               umbrellas. The whole "D" staff is there, including Cathy, 
               having lunch, along with Claire, the casting assistant. In 
               the b.g., we see Matt, huddled, sitting on the roof's awful 
               green outdoor carpeting, feeling much the same as Jeannie in 
               the previous scene.

               ON MATT

               Off in the distance, the Popcorn execs contentedly ply their 
               trade. As he overhears their conversation and the words begin 
               to register in all their horror.

                                     MILLIE
                         Will somebody take a minute to look 
                         over my casting list before Burke 
                         gets here?

                                     MALE D PERSON
                              (scanning list)
                         This isn't so great, Millie.

                                     MILLIE
                         Well, I wanted to put in people we 
                         had a shot at getting.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                              (reading from list)
                         F. Murray Abraham, Jeff Daniels, Ed 
                         Harris, John Lithgow, Rip Torn, Willem 
                         Dafoe, John Malkovich... For an action 
                         lead?

                                     MILLIE
                         Could you at least take it one person 
                         at a time instead of...

                                     MALE D PERSON
                         Okay. Let's play 'State the 
                         Obvious'... F. Murray Abraham has a 
                         nose as long as an Aspen ski line, 
                         Ed Harris is losing his hair, Joe 
                         Mantegna has never played the lead 
                         in a big movie... Willem Dafoe's 
                         teeth... Bob Hoskins looks fur bearing 
                         when he takes off his shirt... 
                         Malkovich...

               Matt can take it no more. He hears a loud voice coming from 
               his own throat. He wigs out.

                                     MATT
                         I can't stand it anymore. I can't.

                                     CATHY
                         What's wrong? What happened?

                                     MATT
                         What, in God's name, are you doing 
                         in this job you have?

               SHOT

               As they all start to answer at once.

                                     MATT
                         I mean him. What, in God's name, do 
                         you know about casting?

                                     MALE D PERSON
                         Me?

               Matt rises and walks towards the Male D Person.

                                     MATT
                         Yes. What do you know? About anything? 
                         You don't even know you have a habit 
                         of touching your tongue with a finger 
                         like you want to lick yourself.
                              (note: this is his 
                              little habit)
                         Yet, you talk like you actually know 
                         something... So I want you to tell 
                         me...
                              (louder)
                         ...what you know.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                         I'm not going to be drawn into this.

                                     MATT
                         I've been an actor most of my life 
                         and this is the first time I've ever 
                         heard what the people calling the 
                         shots sound like when they're casting. 
                         So I really want to find out what, 
                         if anything, you know because what 
                         if nothing you know.

                                     FEMALE D PERSON
                         I don't think the yelling is 
                         necessary.

                                     MATT
                         Oh, you couldn't be more wrong. And 
                         I'm not talking to you. And I don't 
                         like you.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                         How about you just mind your own 
                         business?

               Matt is very close to him--he shakes his chair.

                                     MATT
                         You're minding my business. That's 
                         the problem... so, just tell me, 
                         what do you know?

               ON MALE D PERSON

               Matt's manner is threatening. The Male D Person looks around 
               for some support and finds little... then Matt's tone 
               changes... it's reasonable, almost seductive.

                                     MATT
                         Just tell me and I'll shut up.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                              (taking the bait)
                         First of all, I've been going to 
                         movies since I was six, for God's 
                         sake...

                                     MATT
                         What you know is the size of a 
                         schnozz. What you don't know is that 
                         these guys...
                              (indicates list)
                         ...are for real...

               ON CATHY

               She is a ricochet victim of every word Matt says, as he 
               continues to indict the Male D Person and unknowingly reach 
               her instead. His fury grows and becomes more complicated, 
               containing an element of mourning.

                                     MATT
                              (again)
                         ...that they can make something 
                         happen, and even they don't know 
                         what that is till they get in there 
                         and play a little... they can make 
                         something happen that you can't even 
                         imagine... and it's not your fault, 
                         this stupidity... 'cause you're just 
                         this scared little prick who gets to 
                         say he's making movies, and the only 
                         thing they ever taught you is that 
                         what you like doesn't matter.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                              (frightened)
                         Thanks for understanding.

               The anger leaves Matt. He is depleted.

                                     MATT
                         But isn't it almost good manners for 
                         you to feel a little shame?

               Cathy rises and begins to exit.

                                     MATT
                              (again)
                         I didn't mean you.

                                     CATHY
                         If you didn't, you sure should have.

               She exits. The D Person's Colleagues have taken advantage of 
               the beat to egg him on.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                         You talk about manners--are you 
                         actually so bitter you don't realize 
                         how you acted just now? You're gone, 
                         pal. But at least know that we can't 
                         help that we're making it.

                                     MATT
                         Oh, shit. You win. You got lucky 
                         with 'bitter.' That word just scares 
                         me to death.

               INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

               A distraught Cathy is walking down as Burke bounds up.

                                     BURKE
                         You look down.

                                     CATHY
                         I am.

                                     BURKE
                         Thank you. I appreciate the support.

                                     CATHY
                         I'm not down for you. I'm down about 
                         myself.

                                     BURKE
                              (not hearing)
                         Oh. What if 'Ground Zero' doesn't do 
                         well this weekend?

                                     CATHY
                         Please listen to me.

               He nods, but she pauses, disconcerted.

                                     BURKE
                         What?

                                     CATHY
                         I just got this feeling of seeing 
                         myself talking to you and how this 
                         is the most important moment of... 
                         ever.

                                     BURKE
                              (brusquely)
                         Okay. Good. What is it?

                                     CATHY
                         I've been watching this company make 
                         movies that cost tens of millions of 
                         dollars and all the while I've known 
                         about this wonderful script which we 
                         can somehow own and we could make 
                         for about $14,000,000... $3,000,000 
                         if you can live without stars or a 
                         name director.

                                     BURKE
                         Is that it? Okay, send me...

                                     CATHY
                         I've sent you coverage on it nine 
                         times. I swear to you, Burke, it 
                         will work. You've never heard me say 
                         that.

                                     BURKE
                         How about last night?

                                     CATHY
                              (an unexpectedly fierce 
                              outburst)
                         I don't know anything about action-
                         adventure!!
                              (on his look, she 
                              gains control)
                         I have no idea where that came from. 
                         Hey, I know everyone thinks I don't 
                         have any commercial sense because of 
                         what I said at the 'Gremlins' preview 
                         and all... And you think I can't put 
                         myself on the line. Well, if this 
                         picture doesn't work, fire me. Have 
                         me killed if it doesn't get good 
                         reviews. If this doesn't get a 70 
                         percent definite recommend from women 
                         49 and under, I promise to be your 
                         sex slave until they drop ticket 
                         prices back to five bucks and start 
                         enforcing the R rating.

                                     BURKE
                         You're selling very excellent. Very 
                         excellent presentation.

                                     CATHY
                         You've got to do this. I think this 
                         movie can save me.

                                     BURKE
                              (disgusted)
                         Oh, please... What's the script?

                                     CATHY
                         'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.'

               EXT. MATT'S APARTMENT - EVENING

               As Matt exits his car with beaten down body language.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

               As he leads Jeannie briskly down the hall from Lucy's 
               apartment and into his own.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Why couldn't you even look at the 
                         way I dressed Ricky?

                                     MATT
                         Look, I don't want to talk about it. 
                         I just had a real rough day... so 
                         just let it sit there, okay?

                                     JEANNIE
                         But what was it? Tellll me... 
                         Compromise... You sad?

                                     MATT
                         Yes.
                              (through gritted neck 
                              cords)
                         Now, I really need to be quiet.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (eyes him, then)
                         You!! I know what will cheer you up.

               Moving very quickly and with great purpose, she slaps a tape 
               into a pink child's cassette player and MUSIC BEGINS... 
               Jeannie sings along with the child's chorus on the tape, 
               "YOU COULD BE WONDERFUL", making, with little hand motions, 
               the last thing Matt needs, but, in due course, he starts to 
               actually make a bit of transitional progress out of his own 
               troubles and into the fact that his daughter is beguiling. 
               But, before the mood can fully sweeten, Jeannie forgets the 
               lyrics and begins to verbally assault herself as the tape 
               continues to play...

                                     JEANNIE
                         I can't even remember the words... I 
                         am stupid.

                                     MATT
                         No, you're not. You're not stupid 
                         and I'm not bitter... and you know 
                         why? Because there's no cure for 
                         either one and we've got to believe 
                         in some cure for each of us.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I am stupid. I can't even remember 
                         the words to some baby song.

                                     MATT
                         Oh, Jeannie... I just can't do this 
                         now.

               The phone rings... As he goes to answer it...

                                     MATT
                              (into phone)
                         Hello? Yes. Cathy... Hey. Just a 
                         second.

               His mood has changed. It's a fine sign that Cathy has called 
               him at home. He needs only for his child to take pity and 
               listen to him.

                                     MATT
                         Jeannie, please... be quiet for one 
                         second... this is very important for 
                         me.

               She decides, with some difficulty, to let him continue.

                                     MATT
                              (into phone)
                         So? Wow. Good for you. 
                         Congratulations.

               Jeannie mouths the words, "Who is it?" Matt holds up a finger 
               asking her to wait.

                                     MATT
                         Me? This is great. I'll come right 
                         over and pick up the script. Okay. 
                         If you want to. Bring it over. 
                         Goodbye.
                              (to Jeannie)
                         We might make it yet, kid.

               EXT. MATT'S STREET - EVENING

               As Cathy drives past some rough examples of street life, and 
               finally finds Matt's building with its grim iron gate security 
               system. Cathy, uncomfortable in these surroundings, parks 
               her car, brushes her hair, while, at the same time, putting 
               in place a phony cheap-car-radio-sticker over her own 
               expensive system, and gets out.

               INT. MATT'S APT. ENTRANCE - EVENING

               She buzzes his apartment and waits.

                                     MATT'S VOICE
                         Cathy?

                                     CATHY
                         Yes.

                                     MATT'S VOICE
                         I'll buzz you in. You've got to be 
                         quick and push hard.

               In the b.g. WE HEAR Jeannie loudly imploring her father to 
               make the person wait till she's finished dressing. There is 
               the SOUND OF the buzzer. Cathy hurls herself at the door a 
               good four times before finally timing it right and gathering 
               the necessary strength to spill through.

               INT. MATT'S HALLWAY - EVENING

               Cathy stands there overhearing the voices from inside.

                                     JEANNIE'S VOICE
                         But why can't I stay just a little 
                         while?

                                     MATT'S VOICE
                         Because this is a very special friend 
                         of Daddy's and I need privacy... Be 
                         fair... I let you wear that dress.

               Cathy knocks. Matt opens the door.

                                     MATT
                         Hi.

               He steps aside so Cathy may enter... The place is tidied up. 
               He has changed his clothes and Jeannie is wearing a lace 
               dress, fit for a young princess, complete with flowered tiara 
               and ballet slippers, with trailing blue ribbons at the heels 
               and a velvet cape.

                                     MATT
                         This is my daughter, Queen Elizabeth. 
                         Jeannie, this is Cathy.

                                     CATHY
                         Hi... What a pretty dress.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Thank you. That's nice.

               ON MATT

               Happy that Jeannie is behaving so well.

                                     CATHY
                         Are you going to a party?

                                     JEANNIE
                              (wildly hopeful)
                         Am I going to a party, Dad?

                                     MATT
                              (quickly)
                         No. You're going next door.

               Jeannie is crest-fallen; for a horrible second, it looks as 
               if she may start to wail... Matt moves into action with a 
               pep talk.

                                     MATT
                         Remember our compromise? You're going 
                         next door to Lucy's to play and you'll 
                         show the kids your dress and I'll 
                         come get you later and we'll go out 
                         someplace and I'll buy you anything 
                         you want for under seventeen dollars?

                                     JEANNIE
                         I remember.

               She starts for the door, doubles back, and kisses a surprised 
               Cathy full on the lips... The gesture is beautifully, even 
               movingly carried off. It is totally false.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (again to Cathy)
                         Goodbye. I love you...

                                     CATHY
                              (totally thrown)
                         Well,... thank you.

               Jeannie is on the run... as she passes her father.

                                     MATT
                              (sotto)
                         Thanks.

               Jeannie nods acknowledgment as she flies past.

               OTHER ANGLE

               Favoring Cathy, Matt leans out the doorway until Jeannie is 
               safely next door, then re-enters.

                                     CATHY
                         What a little winner, huh?

                                     MATT
                              (modestly)
                         Oh...?

                                     CATHY
                              (waving script)
                         This is my favorite project. And it 
                         looks like we're going ahead with 
                         it.

                                     MATT
                              (overlap)
                         'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town?' Oh, it's a 
                         remake...

                                     CATHY
                         Well, come on, what's original? And 
                         this is a wonderful rewrite. It's 
                         funnier.

                                     MATT
                         And there's a part in it for...

                                     CATHY
                         Yes... Burke says I can test whoever 
                         I want. He wasn't even surprised 
                         when I mentioned you. So, if you 
                         could read this rewrite now and if 
                         you like it, we can make a test 
                         deal...
                              (catching herself)
                         they can make a test deal... we can 
                         tell them that they can make a test 
                         deal.
                              (in explanation)
                         I think it's important for me to 
                         steer clear of the business end.

                                     MATT
                         Okay... which part?

                                     CATHY
                         Longfellow Deeds.

                                     MATT
                         Mr. Deeds?

                                     CATHY
                         Who goes to town, yes.

               Matt takes this in... takes this miracle in.

                                     MATT
                         Who are we kidding? I'm even having 
                         trouble getting short parts--I'm 
                         going to say I love it no matter 
                         what you've done to it.

                                     CATHY
                         Stop being so creepy honest. I really 
                         have an instinct about you for this. 
                         I'm going home--call me when you 
                         finish reading it.
                              (how quickly status 
                              changes things)
                         Or... come on over.

               INT. BURKE'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

               A post-coital moment though only the man is visible; Burke, 
               who lies on the bed wearing a shirt and tie and nothing else. 
               Nan lies out of sight on the floor where she is recovering 
               from the deepest orgasm of her life.

                                     BURKE
                         Why not? If you can test movies and 
                         premises and want-to-sees, why can't 
                         you test screen tests?

               Nan hauls herself into view, climbing back onto the bed.

                                     NAN
                         I can't deal with your self-centered 
                         dribble right now. I have just had 
                         the biggest orgasm of my life and 
                         I'm trying to figure out if I'm in 
                         love with you.

                                     BURKE
                         What?

                                     NAN
                         Whoops. Tell me what made you rush 
                         over and pick me up and bring me 
                         here at six o'clock. I mean we seem 
                         to have...

               She closes her eyes in a characteristic and touching gesture, 
               as the scientist in her struggles to be precise.

                                     NAN
                              (again)
                         ...this unspoken agreement not to 
                         talk about why we're together when 
                         we're together and I don't think 
                         it's good to let that become a pattern 
                         for us.

               She focuses again on Burke. Prepared for, at last, some verbal 
               intimacy.

                                     BURKE
                         Why did I rush to you? Because I 
                         felt like I had to... be with someone 
                         and you were closest.
                              (on Nan's reaction)
                         What's wrong?

                                     NAN
                         You're not at all aware that you've 
                         just said something...
                              (her eyes close)

               EXT. CATHY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Matt, holding the script, walks the small lane through the 
               tidy lawn to the perfect Silver Lake cottage. We HEAR MUSIC 
               from inside. (A soundtrack.) There is a note on the door, 
               which is slightly ajar, reading: "Come right in if you loved 
               it--ring if you have reservations." Matt enters.

               INT. CATHY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               White walls, thick rugs, great, great, fantasy garret; sparse, 
               but cozy. He walks a step, then there is a girlish squeal 
               and a naked Cathy streaks the rest of the way to her bedroom 
               from the bathroom.

                                     CATHY
                              (calling)
                         I mistimed it.
                              (sticking her head 
                              out the door)
                         I wanted you to catch me fully 
                         frontal.

               She smiles broadly; hurriedly putting on something quick and 
               loose to match her buzz. As she walks to him, the phone rings. 
               She ignores it.

                                     CATHY
                         So you loved it. A lot? A little?

                                     MATT
                         Give me a second--all of a sudden, 
                         there's a lot to deal with.

               She sits on the sofa--looking at him.

                                     MATT
                              (again)
                         It's terrific.

                                     CATHY
                              (pointedly)
                         Do you see why I think you're right?

                                     MATT
                         Because you're nice and you know I 
                         need work.

                                     CATHY
                              (lower)
                         You know this is really happening, 
                         so I wish you wouldn't kid around 
                         about it.

                                     MATT
                         Sorry, but I think the audition rule 
                         is that I have to be serious unless 
                         the person in charge is wearing a 
                         bathrobe and her nipples are sticking 
                         out...
                              (holds fingers apart)
                         ...this much.

               Cathy peeks down her bathrobe. Then broadly.

                                     CATHY
                         There are some mixed signals coming 
                         out of here, aren't there?
                              (phone rings; she 
                              answers)
                         Hi. Working... I can't write down a 
                         number now. Call me back.
                              (to Matt)
                         The script?

                                     MATT
                         It's really good. I get a little 
                         nervous thinking about the 
                         opportunity.

                                     CATHY
                         I want to hear everything. You want 
                         to go page by page?

                                     MATT
                         If it's okay. I kind of work on these 
                         things in a private... it's just... 
                         it's a little better for me if I 
                         don't...

                                     CATHY
                              (hurt)
                         Okay.

                                     MATT
                         Okay, let's do it. It won't kill me.

                                     CATHY
                         Please. I understand.

               An uncertain beat and then she leans over and kisses him. A 
               sound escapes him. They get up and begin walking to the 
               bedroom.

                                     MATT
                         I swear to God, I don't know which 
                         thing I want more, the sex or the 
                         conversation afterwards.

                                     CATHY
                              (a smile)
                         What do you mean?

               INT. CATHY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               As they enter and move to the bed where Matt starts 
               undressing.

                                     MATT
                         I mean I haven't been to bed with 
                         anyone since Jeannie got here... I 
                         haven't talked to anyone the way I 
                         need to.
                              (cradling her breast)
                         I haven't seen anything this 
                         beautiful. I haven't felt this good 
                         about life. I mean, I've been lonely, 
                         Cathy.

                                     CATHY
                              (as he enters her)
                         I'll tell you the truth, Matt. I've 
                         never felt more like turning my phone 
                         off.

               She twists her body gracefully, sexily towards the phone.

                                     MATT
                         You can't shut the phone off. I left 
                         this number with Jeannie's sitter.

                                     CATHY
                         I don't understand what you're worried 
                         about.

                                     MATT
                         I'm not worried. But if the phone 
                         was off, I would worry.

                                     CATHY
                         But I get a lot of calls.

                                     MATT
                         Oh.

                                     CATHY
                         I could put the machine on 'monitor,' 
                         but it's going to be... I don't know.

                                     MATT
                         It will be okay. I think the most 
                         important thing is to stop talking 
                         about the phone. Turn it off, monitor, 
                         whatever.

                                     CATHY
                         Okay.

               She twists toward the phone again--not quite so beautifully.

               OTHER ANGLE

               As she hits the "monitor" button, then turns back to him.

                                     CATHY
                         You look so serious.

                                     MATT
                         I am so serious.

               CATHY'S POV

               Matt totally there... this is major for him, then he does 
               something sensitive... reads her concern over the depth of 
               his need and interest and shrugs, indicating he can't help 
               it.

               ON CATHY

               She likes him.

               THE COUPLE

               As they make love... their union thrown off kilter by the 
               phone messages which roll in periodically as they thrust and 
               sweat towards intimacy.

                              (broadly)
                         Hi, Cathy... All my magazines came 
                         today... Read the new Vanity Fair, 
                         they take apart three people we 
                         hate... Spy is bad this month...

                         Why aren't you at the office? You 
                         know, I'm getting to the point where 
                         I prefer to reach people's machines... 
                         Bye.

               The love making continues as the calls continue.

                         Cathy? Are you there? Hello... Are 
                         you there?? I'm going to count to 
                         ten. One, two, three...
                              (then to someone 
                              passing his office)
                         Did you go to the screening last 
                         night? What did you think? That makes 
                         two bombs in a row for her.
                              (into phone)
                         ...four, five, six... Pick up if 
                         you're there. I've got major gossip... 
                         major screwup. It could be good for 
                         us.

               Cathy, in the throes of sexual union, feeling a bit divided 
               by the offer on the phone... she shakes it off.

                                     MATT
                         Is this the kind of crap you listen 
                         to all day?

                                     CATHY

                         questioning everything... including 
                         action-adventure... Don't tell anyone 
                         I'm down. Even destroy the message 
                         tape. Don't tell anyone I said to 
                         destroy the message tape. Don't even 
                         give hints that there's something 
                         you can't tell them, but you wish 
                         you could... I'm losing it. I'm losing 
                         it. I'm losing it. Don't tell nobody. 
                         Don't tell nobody. Don't tell nobody.

               The sound of a hang up... the couple having more difficulty 
               making love...

               ON CATHY AND MATT

               As they look to the phone and react--still joined, then:

                                     JEANNIE'S VOICE
                              (sobbing)
                         Daddy...
                              (berating someone who 
                              is with her)
                         You dialed bad... Where is he?

                                     LUCY'S VOICE
                              (with Jeannie coaching 
                              b.g.)
                         Matt, Jeannie is very upset because 
                         you are not here when you said. And 
                         now the big hand is on the eight...

               The sound of a hangup... As Matt springs from the bed.

                                     MATT
                         I'm sorry...

                                     CATHY
                         It's all right.

                                     MATT
                              (as he leaves)
                         Is there a name for what we just 
                         had?

               INT. BURKE'S CAR - DAY

               Matt driving. Burke in back as his anxieties gnaw away.

                                     MATT
                         This is awkward, my driving you around 
                         and testing for you tomorrow.

                                     BURKE
                         Not really.

                                     MATT
                         Well, I hope you understand I can't 
                         drive you to work tomorrow and then 
                         go in and test. It's just...

               Burke reluctantly considers, then:

                                     BURKE
                         Okay. I was going to come in late 
                         anyway. I'll get one of the kids to 
                         drive me.

                                     MATT
                         Thanks. And, look, if I get the lead 
                         in this movie, you'll have to go 
                         back to sitting up front with me.

               Burke laughs--surprised at being genuinely amused.

               INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - MORNING

               Matt, wildly dialing a phone--orange juice in hand, Jeannie 
               standing nearby. He shrieks one phrase.

                                     MATT
                              (into phone)
                         No sitter!!! Thanks. We're leaving 
                         now.

               INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - DAY

               Matt is in the final process of being made up, going over 
               his lines. Cathy enters.

                                     CATHY
                         Jeannie's fine. There's a whole bunch 
                         of kids in the building. She's 
                         fascinated. And they're all ready 
                         for you.

                                     MATT
                         How many men are they testing today?

                                     CATHY
                         You're the only one.

               Matt is surprised... But he is a pro and so immediately makes 
               use of this sudden blip in status.

                                     MATT
                         Then tell them I need a little more 
                         time.

                                     MAKE-UP PERSON
                         No, it's okay, we're done.

                                     MATT
                         I mean for me. I want to focus a 
                         little.

                                     CATHY
                         Sure.
                              (she hugs Matt)
                         Good luck, Matt.
                              (whispered advice)
                         The thing they're looking for most 
                         is sexy.

               And then they're gone. With that bit of advice, Matt is 
               totally fucked up. A beat after Cathy leaves:

                                     HAIR PERSON
                         You know who she was involved with 
                         for a minute or so?

                                     MAKE-UP PERSON
                         Who?

                                     MATT
                              (quickly)
                         Hey!

               On their look...

                                     MATT
                              (again)
                         You guys have to leave. This is 
                         important and I need to be alone 
                         right now...

               They exit... Matt thumbs through the script... does a 
               relaxation exercise... takes a breath and thinks... a beat 
               and he is reasonably confident... he walks one half-circle 
               of the room making sure he's fully pumped, then exits.

               EXT. POPCORN MOVIES - DAY

               As crowded as it was for the previous audition scene, but 
               this time they are reading children of varied ages, and the 
               kids and their parents are all over the stairs, etc. Jeannie 
               is filled with wonder and is arrestingly and atypically shy, 
               as she makes her way through this world of the young, clinging 
               to Cathy's hand, as the kids sing their version of "MAKE 
               BELIEVE"--the stage parents taking one verse. At one point, 
               Cathy's begins talking to someone, blocking Jeannie's view.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Get out of my way!

                                     CATHY
                         Don't say it like that!!!

                                     JEANNIE
                         Which way should I?
                              (polite little girl)
                         Get out of my way.
                              (almost weeping)
                         Get out of my way.
                              (furious)
                         Get out of my way.

               All this noticed by a casting person with a clipboard.

                                     CASTING PERSON
                         Wow.

               INT. POPCORN PICTURES HALLWAY - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

               Matt making his way past the last of the kid stragglers. 
               Cathy and Jeannie come running up to him.

                                     MATT
                         It felt great... Everybody...

                                     JEANNIE
                         Let me tell him, let me tell him, 
                         let me tell him...

                                     CATHY
                              (highly annoyed)
                         Let him finish! God!

                                     JEANNIE
                         I want to tell him.

                                     CATHY
                         If you wait one minute, I'll let 
                         you.

               Jeannie turns down her volume, but keeps repeating--incanting 
               actually... "I can't wait to tell him... I can't wait to 
               tell him... I can't wait to tell him..."

                                     MATT
                         Anyway, the girl I did it with, by 
                         the way, she's really good; the 
                         director, the crew... they all thought 
                         we nailed it.

                                     CATHY
                              (loving, sexy)
                         Hey.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (to Cathy)
                         Now?

               Cathy nods and Jeannie begins to push Matt into Cathy's office 
               for privacy.

                                     CATHY
                         Wait till you hear this one.

               INT. CATHY'S OFFICE

               Jeannie sits her father down. This is the first time we've 
               seen her joyful. Pure glee.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Some lady asked me to go in a room 
                         and, you know, make believe and say 
                         stuff like we were playing a game...

               The words coming so fast that Jeannie lets loose with a bolt 
               of SONG, as if taking a moment to catch her breath. Just a 
               few sung lines proclaiming happiness.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (again)
                         And everybody went 'yea' and they 
                         said they wanted me to be on 
                         television.

               And the SUNG PHRASE.

                                     JEANNIE
                         And give me money and have a teacher 
                         there and a person to braid my hair 
                         and color my face and give me 
                         clothes...

               The sung phrase again.

               ON MATT

               Stricken.

                                     MATT
                         You wait here, Jeannie.

               INT. CATHY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

               Several people milling about... Matt eyes Cathy. We still 
               hear Jeannie's muffled singing from the other side of the 
               door.

                                     MATT
                              (furious)
                         I have to talk to you.

               EXT. POPCORN PICTURES - DAY

               As Matt and Cathy come into frame... Matt forcefully placing 
               her with her back to the wall. She is not one to be pushed 
               around.

                                     CATHY
                         Don't!

                                     MATT
                         What in hell is wrong with you? You 
                         actually think...

                                     CATHY
                         I'm trying to hang in here but 
                         everything in me cuts off when 
                         somebody acts this way.

                                     MATT
                              (continuing right 
                              along)
                         ...that you can have my kid audition 
                         for a show without asking me.

                                     CATHY
                         I didn't... She went for water and 
                         by the time she got back, they had 
                         offered her the part. Blame Burke, 
                         he was there...

               Matt takes this in. Just a millimeter underneath his fury is 
               professional curiosity.

                                     MATT
                         What's the part, anyway?

                                     CATHY
                         The white kid in a multi-racial foster 
                         home with all these kids of varying 
                         ages. It's not a bad show. I sure 
                         can't wait to see the test.

                                     MATT
                         How were they able to test her so 
                         fast?

                                     CATHY
                         No. They offered it to her off the 
                         reading. I meant your test.

                                     MATT
                         Oh... A child actor. Just what any 
                         kid with problems needs to straighten 
                         out--a series of her own...

               Cathy has nothing to offer. Matt begins leading her back. We 
               HOLD ON THEIR BACKS and see the chink in Matt's confidence, 
               hear the tightness in his voice as he asks:

                                     MATT
                         You'll let me know as soon as they 
                         see my test?

                                     CATHY
                         Right away... You've got my vote.

               They hold hands.

               INT. MATT'S APT. - NIGHT

               Jeannie, a script in her lap, caressing it, avoiding her 
               father's gaze. He sits nearby sizing her up, pissed.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I'm doing it.

                                     MATT
                         Not if I don't let you. That's the 
                         law, the police law.

               She takes this shot hard, but tries to pretend otherwise, 
               continuing to stare hard at her script to avoid him.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Do I have to learn to read to be on 
                         television?

                                     MATT
                              (with a real edge)
                         You're going to have to learn to 
                         look at me and listen to me and the 
                         longer I have to wait THE ANGRIER 
                         I'M GOING TO BE.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (looks up suddenly)
                         I'm so mad.

                                     MATT
                         Me too. Just listen.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I don't... why?!?

                                     MATT
                         Because I know about this. I have 
                         worked with kid actors... They don't 
                         have that much fun. They're inside 
                         all day... they don't get to go to 
                         regular schools or play with their 
                         regular friends like Ricky and Essa.
                              (progressively losing 
                              it)
                         And their parents? You think I'm 
                         going to be one of those parents, 
                         sitting in one of those rooms, where 
                         we all go crazy trying to jump start 
                         our egos with our kids' sweat, all 
                         the time smiling at each other like 
                         our lives are working while we root 
                         against everyone else's little girl?
                              (Jeannie is totally 
                              confused, until)
                         No!! No way! I can't!

                                     JEANNIE
                         Okay. So, no, you're cuckoo anyway. 
                         I won't do it. And I don't care 
                         because I'm be stupid at it anyway.

               She throws the script down. Tears in her eyes.

                                     MATT
                         Pick it up, Jeannie.

               She's so down, she complies--picking it up and walking it to 
               the trash can. Matt stops her and takes the script.

                                     MATT
                         Let's work on it.

               INT. BURKE'S OFFICE - DAY

               The staff of Popcorn Pictures is gathered in the boss' office 
               watching Matt's screentest on projection TV. Burke sits next 
               to Nan on a sofa--Cathy sits in front of him--others in chairs 
               or on the floor. One ASSISTANT is attempting to "fine tune" 
               the color--the TINT BAR GRAPH is on screen sliding between + 
               and - as the color changes. Burke talks sotto to Nan.

                                     BURKE
                         So how do you think 'Ground Zero' 
                         will do tonight?

               She ignores him, continuing to watch the screen. He leans 
               into her.

                                     BURKE
                         How do you think my movie will do 
                         tonight?

                                     NAN
                              (testy)
                         I'm not going to talk to you during 
                         Matt's screentest.

               Cathy turns in her chair and mouths "thank you" to Nan.

                                     BURKE
                              (to himself)
                         How bad can it be? We've got to have 
                         at least a two million dollar Friday. 
                         There's nothing else out there.

                                     CATHY
                              (turning to him)
                         Please.

                                     BURKE
                         I'm watching...

               ON SCREEN

               A VERY ATTRACTIVE ACTRESS is crying... Matt very close to 
               her...

                                     BURKE'S VOICE
                         Stop playing with that thing.

               The COLOR BAR GRAPH does a quick slide and disappears from 
               the screen leaving the actors' faces green.

                                     ACTRESS
                              (crying)
                         C'mon, Deeds, tell me about the 
                         meeting.

                                     MATT
                         What's wrong?

                                     ACTRESS
                         Don't worry about my crying. As a 
                         matter of fact, crying turns me on.

                                     MATT
                         Well, in that case, your dog died.

               There is laughter in the room. The actress smiles through 
               her tears--pats Matt for being wonderful.

                                     ACTRESS
                         What happened at the meeting?

                                     MATT
                         I can't remember. You're too pretty.
                              (on her look)
                         Oh, I told them I'd keep on being 
                         Chairman.
                              (then explaining)
                         I'm Chairman, you know.

                                     ACTRESS
                              (smiling)
                         I know.

                                     MATT
                         Told them I'd keep on being Chairman 
                         if they hired everybody back.

                                     ACTRESS
                         What did they say?

                                     MATT
                         Oh, that I was crazy. You always 
                         wear your hair back like that?

               She kisses him. We HEAR the director say, "Cut. Terrific, 
               guys." The girl and Matt hug, no longer in character, as 
               others come in to congratulate them.

               INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY

               Ad-libbed enthusiasm... mostly about the girl...

               ON CATHY

               As the conversation about the girl grows more pointed... 
               Cathy, impassive outwardly, recoiling inwardly.

                                     BURKE
                         Okay, come on... let's have our 
                         creative meeting right here.

                                     MALE D PERSON
                         Well, I'd sure go to bed with her.

                                     BURKE
                              (professionally 
                              concurring)
                         Very fuckable.

                                     MALE CASTING PERSON
                         I'd sure fuck her.

                                     BURKE
                         Okay... that's her... What about 
                         him?

                                     FEMALE D PERSON
                         I think he's a very good to excellent 
                         actor--I do...
                              (puzzled)
                         But there's something...

                                     BURKE
                         You wouldn't want to fuck him?

                                     FEMALE D PERSON
                         Well, six years ago, maybe.

                                     CLAIRE
                         I think he's talented and attractive.

                                     BURKE
                         So you'd want to fuck him?

                                     CLAIRE
                         He might be light in that area.

                                     CATHY
                         The man is talented. If you get one 
                         of those directors who like actors, 
                         I think...

                                     BURKE
                         A director can't make you hot if 
                         you're not hot. You'll end up with 
                         warm which is death.

                                     CATHY
                              (defending Matt 
                              slightly)
                         We laughed.

                                     BURKE
                         Let me ask you something... Would 
                         you fuck him?

                                     CATHY
                              (wearily)
                         Everything doesn't boil down to...

                                     BURKE
                         Let me stop you before you embarrass 
                         yourself.

               Burke rises and addresses his staff... the camera has his 
               back in the foreground as it MOVES TOWARDS A RENDEZVOUS, 
               Burke moving too as he continues...

                                     BURKE
                              (again)
                         We all can do our little lectures on 
                         what things boil down to. Everybody 
                         else here was professional enough to 
                         come out and say... I'd fuck her... 
                         I wouldn't fuck him... and you're 
                         ducking it... I want you to forget 
                         the acting stuff and totally focus 
                         on the issue.

               And now Burke and CAMERA meet up--the effect being that he 
               is talking directly to us as he continues.

                                     BURKE
                              (again)
                         We do have some kind of responsibility 
                         to the audience... You just saw his 
                         screentest... so, if this is the 
                         first time you saw the guy, do you 
                         come out thinking to yourself and 
                         your girl friends, 'I'd sure go to 
                         bed with him; oh God, would he be 
                         something.' Would you, Cathy?... I'm 
                         being real here.

                                     CATHY
                         No...

                                     BURKE
                         Okay, so let's keep looking.

               They file out. Cathy gets up several beats later than the 
               others... and follows them out, avoiding Nan's look.

               INT. CATHY'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

               She's been sitting here for quite a while... she can postpone 
               no longer; she dials as one of her MOVIE SOUND TRACKS PLAYS 
               in the background.

                                     CATHY
                              (into phone)
                         Hello. Matt... Hi... Okay, sure...

               She listens, waiting for him to quiet Jeannie.

                                     CATHY
                              (again)
                         Matt...
                              (louder)
                         Matt... Matt... Maybe it would be 
                         easier if I just said 'hi' to her... 
                         Hi, Jeannie... Yes, it's exciting... 
                         No, no. He's right, honey, they get 
                         somebody to read it to you. Now, put 
                         your dad on--it's important. No, 
                         first put your dad on... DAMN IT!
                              (she waits a beat)
                         ...Matt. Uh-huh, a few hours ago... 
                         They all... everyone liked your work, 
                         but I think they'll go for a name or 
                         something.

               She listens to him. He is hurt. Cathy, though, is also 
               wrestling with her own internal struggles. She has betrayed 
               him and is ashamed; in a strange way--terrified. She is, 
               therefore, just a little irritable.

                                     CATHY
                              (again)
                         It's not a matter of doing it 
                         differently... they liked what you 
                         did, a lot... they laughed and... 
                         it's not you... it's them.
                              (suddenly her breath 
                              comes weird)
                         No, please. Don't thank me. If you 
                         feel like getting together later or 
                         anytime, call me, okay? You sound 
                         like you have your hands full right 
                         now... Goodbye.

               INT. MATT'S APT. - NIGHT

               As he hangs up...

                                     JEANNIE
                         I wanted to talk to her again... 
                         I...

               She stops in mid-sentence, looking at her father. He is 
               overcome... his energy failing to get him past this most 
               awful moment in his life. She moves to his side. He starts 
               to cry and, urgently seeking privacy, he moves quickly towards 
               the bathroom, rubbing Jeannie in an instinctive gesture of 
               reassurance. He closes the door.

               ON JEANNIE

               Devoid of anger. Sympathy so pure that it wrenches. She starts 
               to move towards the bathroom. Her voice sweet...

                                     JEANNIE
                         Dad? Daddy?

               Matt opens the door quickly.

                                     MATT
                         Everything's okay... I'm sorry I 
                         forgot to put you back on with Cathy.

               He walks across the room, Jeannie tracking him.

                                     JEANNIE
                         You didn't cried because of that... 
                         I don't even want to talk to her.

               Matt sits down, still suffering a bit of dysfunction, unable 
               to keep up appearances other than a few minor half-hearted 
               tweaks at his daughter who stands solemn and silent at his 
               side. She pets him some... this goes on for several beats as 
               the STRAINS OF "YOU COULD BE WONDERFUL" accompany the moment. 
               Then:

                                     JEANNIE
                              (a whisper)
                         Dad. Can I say just one thing?

               With some effort, Matt lifts his head and nods permission.

                                     JEANNIE
                         You've got to make me supper.

               Matt nods, rises and leads her into the small kitchen.

               INT. BURKE'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Burke is wearing a T-shirt and shorts as he walks to his 
               four-stops-past-state-of-the-art Stairmaster and turns it on 
               while looking over his shoulder at the telephone... now 
               sucking in some courage, he goes to the phone and speed dials. 
               He begins to climb the stairs.

                                     VOICE

                         dollars.

               He braces himself... there is a tone, then:

                                     PHONE VOICE
                         Due to the high volume of calls, we 
                         must ask you to wait till a line is 
                         clear...

               MUSIC IN... At first from the speaker phone... Burke moving 
               in time to "THERE IS A LONELY..." And now singing... As the 
               lyric concludes and the instrumental comes in.

                                     PHONE VOICE

                         percent.

               Burke smiles with pleasure... his steps becoming lighter, 
               more fanciful.

               anticipation.

               Burke falls off his Stairmaster and, from his new position, 
               finishes his song.

               INT. BURKE'S CAR - DAY

               Matt is driving. Burke is seated alongside him, talking 
               without looking at him.

                                     BURKE
                         I'm going to pieces...
                              (whispering)
                         The picture was budgeted at 21 million 
                         and I spent 49 so they were a little 
                         mad at me to begin with. Now it 
                         doesn't open even with an Arby's 
                         Roast Beef tie-in... I mean, we only 
                         averaged 300 dollars a theater... 
                         they're going to think I'm Woody 
                         Allen.

                                     MATT
                         I don't think you have to worry about 
                         that.

                                     BURKE
                         Thanks. But this is private. What 
                         about the exit survey? Did we do 
                         good with any group at all?

               Now we HEAR Nan's voice on the speakerphone which Burke has 
               been addressing all along.

                                     NAN'S VOICE
                         I can't hear you, but--hi, Matt--
                         that was funny.

                                     MATT
                         Hi.

                                     NAN'S VOICE
                         'I don't think you have to worry 
                         about that?'

               She laughs delightedly. Burke leans across Matt's lap to get 
               closer to the microphone.

                                     BURKE
                         Did we do well with any group at 
                         all?

                                     NAN'S VOICE
                         Eleven-year-old boys in the South.

               He sits stupified.

                                     NAN'S VOICE
                              (again)
                         Burke? Burke? Matt, is he...

                                     BURKE
                         I'll see you later. Goodbye.

                                     NAN'S VOICE
                         But, hon...

               He hits the "end" button. He slumps for a second, then:

                                     BURKE
                         I'm all alone...
                              (pause)
                         At least there's that.

               EXT. POPCORN PICTURES - DAY

               As the car arrives outside Popcorn Pictures, we can SEE some 
               child actors and their parents arriving at the sound stage 
               next door.

                                     MATT
                         Are you going to need me? The kids 
                         are rehearsing and I'd like to take 
                         a look.

                                     BURKE
                         Yeah, sure. I have to stay inside 
                         during lunch hours now anyway--that's 
                         when everybody returns my calls 
                         because they're trying to miss me.

                                     MATT
                              (amazed)
                         Is that true?

                                     BURKE
                              (misinterpreting)
                         Yeah. Thanks for the support.

               INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

               A row of parents standing near their child actors, adjusting 
               them--not unlike handlers of racing Greyhounds.

               ON JEANNIE

               Seen from a distance--her father behind her. In the 
               foreground, the mass of workers on the stage, It is, in 
               effect, her POV, even though she is in the extreme background 
               of the shot. We MOVE CLOSER to Jeannie and her father--even 
               a bit behind them. Jeannie is scared.

                                     MATT
                         I bet I know what it looks like to 
                         you.

                                     JEANNIE
                         What?

                                     MATT
                         A giant "find Waldo."

               Despite herself, she smiles at the reference, though her 
               tone is a bit sarcastic.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Very funny.

                                     PASSING VOICE
                         Five minutes, children, then we need 
                         you for work on the set.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Set?

                                     MATT
                         That pretend living room, right over 
                         there.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Okay. Set. Bye...

                                     MATT
                              (holding her arm)
                         Wait a second, Jeannie. Let Daddy 
                         give you a few tips here.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (twisting away)
                         Nooo. I've got to get to work.

               She breaks free, depriving Matt of the sweet and simple moment 
               he wanted with her. She's one of the first ones on the set, 
               other kids still hugging their parents. As Cathy comes up 
               behind Matt, we can HEAR Jeannie who, having so small a trust 
               for her father, needs to confirm what he just told her.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (faintly)
                         Is this the set?

               Matt reacts.

                                     PASSING VOICE
                         Parents to Room Two, please.

                         Parents to Room Two, please.

               Jeannie is watching.

                                     PASSING VOICE
                              (again)
                         We have to clear the set.

               Matt looks him off fiercely. The Passing Voice addresses the 
               friendlier parents.

                                     PASSING VOICE
                              (again)
                         This way, parents.

                                     CATHY
                         I'm glad I found you.

                                     MATT
                         Hi.

               OTHER AREA - BEHIND GRANDSTAND SEATS

               As they walk.

                                     CATHY
                         You holding up? What did you do last 
                         night after I called?

                                     MATT
                              (as if teasing)
                         What do you think I did? I cried 
                         like a baby.

                                     CATHY
                         Okay. Okay. So you don't want to 
                         tell me. Be a tough guy.

                                     MATT
                         Now you got it.

                                     CATHY
                         I feel relieved just seeing you after 
                         all that stuff... whew... Okay.
                              (preparing to go)
                         Burke wants to...

                                     MATT
                         You ever go out with him?

               Cathy is as simple and direct as she is embarrassed.

                                     CATHY
                         Yes.

                                     MATT
                         You slept with him?

                                     CATHY
                         Yes.

                                     MATT
                         Did you hate it?

                                     CATHY
                         Eventually.

                                     MATT
                              (reeling a bit)
                         Good Lord.

                                     CATHY
                         This is the thing that makes me 
                         nervous about you... You keep on 
                         assuming I'm nicer than I am.

               He kisses her. She kisses back. Then there is an 
               extraordinarily loud and piercing voice.

                                     JEANNIE
                         DAD!!

               He turns to see Jeannie beckoning to him from the stage--the 
               director, standing at her side, joins in. He walks to them.

               ANGLE - STAGE FULL OF ACTORS

               The Director is talking to Jeannie who seems, even from a 
               distance, distraught and lost. She sees Matt.

                                     JEANNIE
                         There's such trouble.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         She's very worried about being able 
                         to pretend cry when she has to and 
                         she doesn't get it about memorizing. 
                         That's all.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (aghast)
                         That's all?!?

               The Director beckons Matt to lead her away. He does.

                                     JEANNIE
                         This isn't going to be good.

                                     MATT
                         Not with that attitude.

               She seems stung by this, unusually vulnerable. He changes 
               tactics, softening.

                                     MATT
                              (again)
                         It's just that they... Well, did 
                         they tell you what an audience is?

                                     JEANNIE
                              (insulted)
                         I know what an audience is.

                                     MATT
                         Good. Now, because there's an 
                         audience, they want you to know all 
                         the words you have to say really 
                         well. And since you can't read yet...
                              (off her fierce look)
                         ...you're going to have to be patient 
                         and try hard. I can help you.

               She grasps at this unlikely straw.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Can you help me to cry?

                                     MATT
                         Yes.
                              (on her broad disbelief)
                         I can. I can help make it okay. Trust 
                         me.

               Jeannie pauses half a beat, then:

                                     JEANNIE
                         I miss my mother bigger than you 
                         know.

               INT. MATT'S APT. - DAY

               Matt on phone, Jeannie standing next to him reaching for the 
               phone.

                                     MATT
                              (to Jeannie)
                         Not yet. Don't grab.
                              (into phone)
                         Thank you. We really appreciate this. 
                         Hi, Beth. I...

               Jeannie grabs the phone in a flash.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (softly into phone)
                         Mom? No... Nothing... Nothing... 
                         Nothing. Nothing... Would you talk? 
                         I'd just like to listen to you... 
                         Wait. Let me sit down.

               Jeannie sits herself by the window, protected by an iron 
               grill, and sits listening to her mother. There is about this 
               pose something prescient; unmistakably, Jeannie will look 
               this way again as a young woman cloaked in the love of some 
               guy... but for now it's her mother, her crazy mother, who 
               blots out dread. Matt is struck by how quiet and adoring 
               Jeannie looks even as he moves to give his daughter some 
               privacy. Several beats, Jeannie noticing her Dad looking at 
               her--switching positions, body language indicating that she 
               wants to put him out of her mind... then a thought.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Dad says he's going to make me to 
                         really cry.

                                     MATT
                         Jeannie, your mom's not going to 
                         understand what you mean.

               Jeannie shushes him, resisting with surprising will and 
               strength when he tries to get the phone.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (to Matt)
                         She understands!!!
                              (into phone)
                         He's being terrible right now.
                              (faster; avoiding 
                              Matt)
                         I love, loved, the coloring book you 
                         sent me. Goodbye. Wait. I love you. 
                         Let me hang up first. Love you. Send 
                         me a letter. Bye. And a beaded T-
                         shirt. Bye.

               She hangs up. Matt pissed.

                                     MATT
                         Why don't you let me be on your side 
                         for a second?

                                     JEANNIE
                         I can't even understand what you're 
                         saying now.

                                     MATT
                         Do you know what trust means?

                                     JEANNIE
                         Not very.

                                     MATT
                         It means that even if something is 
                         hard to believe, you believe someone 
                         you trust because you know he wouldn't 
                         say it unless it were true.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I understand. So I don't trust 
                         anybody, right?

                                     MATT
                         Yeah, I think you get the concept.

                                     JEANNIE
                         You don't make sense. I don't 
                         understand you.

                                     MATT
                         I think you do.

               Jeannie reacts broadly... indicating what a difficult man 
               she's stuck with.

                                     MATT
                         Just know that...

                                     JEANNIE
                         Okayyyy!

                                     MATT
                              (giving up)
                         You want to help me make a phone 
                         call?

               She goes quickly to the phone and picks it up.

                                     MATT
                         Seven... two...

                                     JEANNIE
                              (hitting numbers)
                         Who are we calling?

                                     MATT
                         Cathy. She's very nice. One... six...

                                     JEANNIE
                              (hard to read)
                         "Very nice..." One...

               INT. CATHY'S HOUSE - DAY

               As she answers phone.

                                     JEANNIE'S VOICE
                         Hi...
                              (to Matt)
                         What now?

               MATT'S VOICE IN BACKGROUND

               Tell her, 'How are you' and then let me...

                                     JEANNIE'S VOICE
                         How are you?

                                     CATHY
                         Jeannie... I can't talk now because...

                                     JEANNIE
                         Wait, my dad wants to...

                                     CATHY
                         Tell him I can't talk 'cause I'm on 
                         the phone with a director...

                                     JEANNIE
                         He wants to talk to you very much 
                         and...

                                     CATHY
                              (sharply)
                         I can't. I have to hang up.

               She does.

               INT. MATT'S APT. - NIGHT

               Jeannie, truly stung by the hang-up. She takes this act of 
               Cathy's as an insult to herself and her father. Matt doesn't 
               feel too wonderful about it himself.

                                     MATT
                         You have to understand that sometimes 
                         people are too busy.

                                     JEANNIE
                         So she's too busy for you?

               INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Burke and Nan eating together on an elevated balcony 
               overlooking the main eating area.

                                     BURKE
                         We look like jerks eating here this 
                         early. Everybody's going to think we 
                         couldn't get a reservation for the 
                         hot hours.

                                     NAN
                         Why do you do this to yourself? Why 
                         do you insist on eating dinner in a 
                         restaurant where you're bound to see 
                         all the people you're afraid of?

                                     BURKE
                         I'm not afraid of them.

                                     NAN
                         What do you call it when you think 
                         that what a group of people think of 
                         you can confirm or destroy any decent 
                         idea you have of yourself?

                         Don't talk to me like this.

                         I want to be treated as if I'm really 
                         saying words to you which you engage 
                         and respond to. I like Matt; I'd 
                         like to know how his daughter did. 
                         So before you take your dance of 
                         desperation across the restaurant 
                         and I end up feeling so sorry for 
                         you that I could die, I would like 
                         you to answer my question.

                         Matt... If the pilot sells, his kid 
                         will be making five thousand a week.

                         I knew. I knew. What the hell are

                         pleases me. I have no idea why.

                                     BURKE
                         I can't be with someone who's not 
                         rooting for me.

                         I think I am. It's just that rooting 
                         for you is a good deal more 
                         complicated than you realize.
                              (as he rises)
                         Don't go.

                                     BURKE
                         Don't worry. I'm not that mad. I 
                         gotta do this.

               MUSIC IN as Burke leaves the table. This "Dance of 
               Desperation" is classical. Burke himself lifting one of the 
               women in greeting, then, as he puts her down.

                                     BURKE
                              (again)
                         Sorry. I thought you were someone 
                         else.

               As he continues to go from table to table.

               TIGHT ON NAN

               As she looks down on him, dying for him, we HEAR her sing 
               the song "Poor Bastards". Finally, not only about Burke--but 
               the other damaged souls he seeks to dance with. Now, Nan can 
               take no more. She exits.

               FULL SHOT - BURKE

               As he sees her go past in the background, he goes after her, 
               finally grabbing her near the Maitre D' station. This, just 
               as TWO IMPORTANT COUPLES arrive. Burke frantically tries to 
               cover.

                                     BURKE
                         Nan, you know Victor and his wife...
                              (he mumbles, unable 
                              to remember any wife's 
                              name)
                         and Jay and his wife...
                              (he mumbles)

                                     NAN
                         Yes. I'm sorry I can't talk now. I'm 
                         very upset about what's happening to 
                         Burke, so I just made up my mind I 
                         can't be witness to it anymore if I 
                         love him and I certainly shouldn't 
                         be here if I don't... so I was just 
                         in the process of leaving when he 
                         stopped me and you folks walked in... 
                         I'm sure you've had something like 
                         this happen to you some time... some 
                         horrible thing in your personal life 
                         happening in public.

               They all nod and ad-lib agreements with her premise to Burke's 
               amazement.

                                     NAN
                              (again)
                         Thank you for understanding.
                              (to Burke)
                         Goodbye. I wish only good things for 
                         you even though I feel I've been 
                         really damaged by this relationship.

               She exits, enormously upset. Burke, torn between following 
               her and repairing the social damage. But the couples are 
               paying him no mind; rather they are impressed with Nan. As 
               they comment, i.e.

                                     COUPLES
                         Wasn't that spectacular? I've never 
                         seen anybody that secure...

               Burke accepts the compliments as if meant for him.

                                     BURKE
                         Thank you. Thank you. We're very 
                         close.

               EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               The strains of "Poor Bastards" underscoring the moment as 
               Burke rushes into the parking area and grabs Nan's hand just 
               as a valet brings her car.

                                     NAN
                         You don't understand that I'm 
                         exhausted from hurting. I'm through 
                         with you.

               She begins to cry. Ordinarily this would be a scene which 
               would be unendurable for Burke. However, the lesson of a 
               moment ago is not lost on him. As people get out of cars and 
               witness the sobbing Nan.

                                     BURKE
                              (to restaurant patrons)
                         Excuse me, we're working our shit 
                         out... I'm sure it happened to you... 
                         you know, private stuff in public.

               The reaction to his openness is disdain and passing contempt. 
               She drives off, leaving Burke hurt and alone. "Poor Bastards" 
               up and out.

               INT. MATT'S APT. - NIGHT

               The lighting soft and sweet. Jeannie's words are tentative 
               as she talks to her father who sits watching intently.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I don't know if I've been bad. I 
                         know somebody's been bad.
                              (hopefully)
                         ...maybe it's you.

               Matt laughs. Jeannie looks at him shyly... he looks at her 
               with encouragement. Suddenly she is in his arms, hugging him 
               hard, an emotional dam seems to have broken.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Oh, I love you so much, I love you 
                         so much... I love you so much.

               Matt holds on--clearly, deeply moved. Then he exercises the 
               effort to control his emotions and speaks, surprisingly, as 
               a Black woman.

                                     MATT
                              (as Black woman)
                         I hope that makes you feel a whole 
                         lot better, Chile... 'Cause it sure 
                         goes a long way to cure what ails 
                         me.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I can't believe I...

                                     MATT
                              (as himself, coaching)
                         ...got in this much...

                                     JEANNIE
                         ...got in this much trouble. .

                                     MATT
                         Right. Over a...

                                     JEANNIE
                              (guessing)
                         Word?

                                     MATT
                         Yes. 'I can't believe I got in this 
                         much trouble over a word.' Now do 
                         you know what she means when she 
                         says that?

                                     JEANNIE
                         I don't want to talk about it--just 
                         say her stuff so I know mine.

                                     MATT
                         No.

               She starts to flail a bit.

                                     MATT
                         It's your choice... But I'm not 
                         helping unless you try to understand 
                         as well as memorize. It will be fun. 
                         Come on. I know it's hard...

                                     JEANNIE
                         Okay. Okay...

                                     MATT
                         Anything to shut me up, huh? Okay, 
                         this little girl you're pretending 
                         to be... she can't be with her Mommy 
                         either, just like you, or her 
                         father... she has to stay in Rainbow 
                         House which is called that because...
                              (Jeannie starts 
                              fidgeting)
                         Jeannie...
                              (she stops)
                         ...because everyone's a different 
                         color... so when this little girl 
                         calls the black lady who takes care 
                         of all the children this terrible 
                         word... it's like the worst thing 
                         anybody can do... Come here.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (approaching him)
                         I don't want to do the 'I love you' 
                         again.

                                     MATT
                         Yeah, I might have been working you 
                         too hard on that one.

               She is unable to resist muttering one sarcastic shot.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Yeah. Why don't you do that with 
                         poopie Cathy?

                                     MATT
                              (ignoring her)
                         Now, did the director tell you how 
                         he wanted you to do it?

                                     JEANNIE
                         He said to smile all the time almost 
                         and to talk... uh...

                                     MATT
                         Faster?

                                     JEANNIE
                         Yes.

                                     MATT
                         Okay. We don't always get good 
                         directors, so it's important for 
                         us...

                                     JEANNIE
                         Me. You're not in the show.

                                     MATT
                         I'm referring to the family of actors, 
                         you little shithead.

               Jeannie doesn't know quite how to take the name calling. 
               MUSIC IN... we're heading for a rendezvous with a dance as 
               it CONTINUES ACROSS THE CUT TO:

               EXT. TV STAGE - EARLY MORNING

               Matt and Jeannie walking from the catering truck. They are 
               eating ravenously. MUSIC CONTINUES... VERY JOYOUS.

                                     JEANNIE
                         This is so good...

                                     MATT
                         It's a breakfast burrito. It's what 
                         actors eat when they're working.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (excited)
                         Really.

               EXT. ROOF GARDEN - DAY

                                     MATT
                         Now, let's work a little more. The 
                         most important acting you do is when 
                         you listen. You're worried about 
                         being able to cry when you're supposed 
                         to, right?

                                     JEANNIE
                         Yes. So much.

                                     MATT
                         Well, there are really only two ways 
                         to do it. Think of something that 
                         makes you really sad... or forget 
                         you're you and really forget you're 
                         pretending...

                                     JEANNIE
                         How do I do that one?

               Matt reads from script.

                                     MATT
                              (as a furious Black 
                              woman)
                         'Don't test me, child! I could eat 
                         you for lunch when I was your age 
                         and I'm a hell of a lot bigger now!'

               Jeannie looks afraid.

                                     MATT
                         That's it... You just looked at me 
                         and acted right without even thinking. 
                         And there are games you can play to 
                         help you with this. Get up...
                              (she does)
                         Now, be my mirror... do exactly what 
                         I do... that's it... now, at a certain 
                         point, I'm going to become your 
                         mirror, but I'm not going to tell 
                         you when... you tell me...

                                     JEANNIE
                              (hesitantly)
                         Now?

               Matt nods.

                                     MATT
                              (enthusiastically)
                         Okay. We're going to make up words. 
                         The words aren't what matter now.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I'm on a roof...

                                     MATT
                         You're a great dad.

                                     JEANNIE
                         You're a...
                              (then stops; then 
                              smiles at him)

               This acting exercise of Chicago's Story Theater leads into 
               the song, "BE MY MIRROR." As the song finishes, Matt and 
               Jeannie are in the best spirits we've seen as an A.D. 
               approaches.

                                     A.D.
                         They need you.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Okay.

               She takes the A.D.'s hand as Matt calls.

                                     MATT
                         You're welcome. Don't mention it.

               INT. CATHY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Cathy is in mid conversation with Millie. Matt enters and 
               boldly says his piece.

                                     MATT
                         I'm a free man. Let's go to your 
                         house and break the answering machine.

                                     CATHY
                         You know, I could get away now. But 
                         I've got a big meeting later. We'd 
                         better take two cars.

               Millie, having been at the screen test viewing, is taken 
               aback, looking from one to the other. Cathy knows what she's 
               thinking and is unnerved, feeling silently accused, as she 
               leads Matt out.

                                     CATHY
                         See you later. Thanks again.

               EXT. STREETS - DAY

               Cathy's car followed by Matt in Burke's car. The frame holds 
               both cars close as if this were one long car.

               INT. CATHY'S CAR - DAY

               She seems troubled. Then a decision. She dials a number on 
               her mobile phone and picks up the receiver.

               INT. MATT/BURKE'S CAR - DAY

               The phone rings. He punches the speaker button.

                                     MATT
                         I hope it's you.

                                     CATHY'S VOICE ON SPEAKER
                         Hi.

               Matt waves...

                                     MATT
                              (delighted)
                         So this is how the big ones make 
                         out.

               FULL SHOT - THE TWO CARS

               Almost bumper to bumper... snuggling.

               ANGLE - CATHY

               She takes a breath and then plunges.

               INT. MATT/BURKE'S CAR - DAY

               As he hears one of the more ominous phrases of the motion 
               picture community.

                                     CATHY'S VOICE
                         Matt, will you take me off the 
                         speaker?

               He picks up the phone. We intercut between the cars.

                                     MATT
                         What's the matter?

                                     CATHY
                              (hyper)
                         I don't know whether I'm being a 
                         coward for telling you this way or 
                         brave for telling you period... Can 
                         you hear me?

                                     MATT
                         Yes.

                                     CATHY
                         But I better talk fast because this 
                         is where my phone always kicks out... 
                         When we did your screentest... Can 
                         you hear me?

                                     MATT
                         Yes.

                                     CATHY
                         Well, I sort of folded on you at the 
                         end.

               She pauses, silence, then:

                                     CATHY
                         Matt?

                                     MATT
                         You didn't like what I did?

                                     CATHY
                         I did. Truly. But the discussion got 
                         sort of dumb. It was a question of 
                         sexiness.

                                     MATT
                         That's what it came down to?

                                     CATHY
                         Well, sort of, yes.

                                     MATT
                         You folded on whether or not I'm 
                         sexy. You don't think I'm sexy... 
                         and you expressed that to...

                                     CATHY
                         Well, I'll tell you. I certainly 
                         must think so pretty much because I 
                         feel great about where we're going 
                         now...

               EXT. NARROW CANYON ROAD - DAY

               There is a longish line of cars behind Matt and Cathy.

               INT. CATHY'S CAR - DAY

                                     CATHY
                         Are you very mad at me?

                                     MATT
                         No. You were just... Aw, damn it, I 
                         am. Very. Yes.

               Matt manages to pull to the side... the other cars gobbling 
               the places behind Cathy, who sees this... and now she watches 
               Matt's car recede from her view.

               MATT'S POV

               Cathy going out of sight.

               ON MATT

               As he lets her go.

               INT. BURKE'S HOME - EARLY MORNING

               He is in bed, wearing a bathrobe, watching projection TV.

                                     FIRST VOICE
                         ...number seven at the box office 
                         this week-end is...

               He switches channels.

                                     VOICE NUMBER TWO
                         ...the two words are Tom Cruise.

               He switches channels.

                                     THIRD VOICE
                         ...becoming the first lawyer to be 
                         awarded his own star on Hollywood 
                         Boule...

               He turns off the TV and crosses to the phone, allowing us to 
               read the back of his bathrobe "ROCKY BALBOA."

               ANGLE ON BURKE

               He looks at the clock which reads "four a.m." and dials.

                                     BURKE
                         Hello, Nan. I hope it's not too late 
                         to call.

               INT. NAN'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

               She has been crying.

                                     BURKE
                         I'd like another chance.

                                     NAN
                         You only think you feel that way 
                         because you're on the verge of failure 
                         and you're without a core...

                                     BURKE
                         See. Nobody else gets me.
                              (a beat then)
                         You wanna have a little sex, honey?

                                     NAN
                              (a beat then)
                         You know I've never hung up on anybody 
                         in my life... because what if the 
                         next thing they said solved 
                         everything... but I must end this 
                         conversation.

               Nan hangs up. Burke picks up a pocket electronic notepad 
               from the bedstand and hits the scroll button.

               INSERT ELECTRONIC NOTEBOOK

               Names and phone numbers.

               ON BURKE

               He scrolls past numbers, considering, finding them wanting, 
               so that, finally, he is scrolling the emptiness of his 
               relationships. Now he considers one number and dials.

               INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

               The phone rings. He picks it up.

                                     MATT
                         Hello.

               INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO

                                     BURKE
                         Hi, Matt, this is Burke. I'm sorry 
                         to bother you at home, but you know 
                         Nan... We were going out a little 
                         and I could use another guy's slant 
                         on what's just happened.

                                     MATT
                         I don't think I can get into this...

                                     BURKE
                         Why? Did I catch you at a bad time?

                                     MATT
                         Worse. You caught me at a bad time 
                         you caused.

                                     BURKE
                         Oh, you mean about the screentest. 
                         The whole room thought you did good 
                         work.

                                     MATT
                              (reinventing irony)
                         Thanks.

                                     BURKE
                         Yeah, look, I'm not going to bother 
                         you about my thing.

                                     MATT
                         Yeah. Okay, good night.

               INT. BURKE'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

               As he hangs up. Looks down and turns off his phone number 
               pocket computer. MUSIC RECALLS Prince's "There is Lonely."

               EXT. TV STUDIO - LATE AFTERNOON

               MUSIC SEGUES to recall "I'LL DO ANYTHING," as he drives past 
               the line waiting to see RAINBOW HOUSE.

               (NOTE: FROM THIS POINT ON, THERE WILL BE AN UNDERCURRENT OF 
               CHOREOGRAPHY TO CONCLUSION...)

               INT. MAKE-UP ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               We see Jeannie's face in the mirror, but it is seen through 
               something resembling fleece, which we now recognize as the 
               strands of Jeannie's hair being combed out to the side by an 
               expert hair-dresser. Jeannie is shifting nervously in the 
               large room where each chair is filled with a child of a 
               different age and color. In the b.g., we can HEAR the voice 
               of the WARM-UP MAN.

                                     WARM-UP MAN
                         ...pilot for a new show called 
                         'Rainbow House'. Just listen to our 
                         band and I'll be back to tell you 
                         more and make you love me...

               The audience laughs thinly. The BAND PLAYS as someone closes 
               the door to the make-up room muffling the offstage sound... 
               There is a good deal of tension in the brightly lit room. 
               Jeannie sits between a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD HISPANIC BOY and a 
               FOUR-YEAR-OLD ASIAN GIRL. The room is abuzz... kids running 
               lines and loudly talking... this builds to a musical life as 
               in our first audition scene... there is a briefly sung phrase 
               (Jeannie not taking part).

               INT. GREEN ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               The parents, in the same variety of skin colors as the child 
               actors, are stuffed into a small room being patronized by 
               the ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. Matt is grimly seated in the middle 
               of a long sofa containing stage mothers. Another sofa is two 
               feet away; the parents strain at each other. The A.D. is 
               talking grandly but we cannot hear his words because the 
               Rainbow Parents are SINGING a phrase from the same song we 
               heard in the make-up room. Matt does not take part in the 
               singing. The music goes under allowing us to now hear the 
               A.D.'s words.

                                     A.D.
                         ...and when you're in the audience, 
                         make sure you laugh and applaud even 
                         when it's somebody else's kid...

               There is appreciative laughter from everyone save Matt, who 
               rises in disgust and crosses out of the room.

                                     A.D.
                              (again)
                         You're not allowed near the stage. 
                         We only have a few minutes...

               Matt ignores him and exits.

               INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

               MUSIC NOW EMPHASIZING THE TENSION OF THE PRE-SHOW ATMOSPHERE. 
               Matt, moving about the area, looking for Jeannie, spots a 
               cluster of other cast members excitedly awaiting their 
               introduction. Jeannie not among them. An A.D. talks with 
               concern to a P.A.

                                     A.D.
                         Let me know if you see the little 
                         white girl.

               Matt, growing concerned, walks on, then:

               MATT'S POV

               Across the stage to the distant make-up room. Jeannie, alone 
               in the room, which is so brightly lit it creates a bizarre 
               effect, as if she were under a surreal spotlight. MUSIC 
               reprises Jeannie's Sinead O'Connor song, "Lonely Life of 
               Mine."

               ON MATT

               Stopping his impulse to go to her--he continues to observe.

               MATT'S POV

               Jeannie is nervous and uncertain... She plays with the handle 
               of the make-up chair... turns herself back and forth... Then 
               a very attractive TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY enters the scene--obviously 
               telling her to hustle... He offers his hand and she takes 
               it, instinctively masking all clues that this hand holding 
               is a "first" of great moment in her life. As they move toward 
               the main stage area, Jeannie looks around, needing 
               something... her dad.

                                     MATT
                         Jeannie.

               She turns--sees her father and gives a small, cursory nod... 
               He moves quickly, drawing even with her but still giving her 
               a bit of space and a low-key pep talk.

                                     MATT
                         Just remember. You're not even here 
                         tonight. There's only this other 
                         little girl that you're pretending 
                         to be who lives at Rainbow House.

                                     JEANNIE
                         ...and who just vomited.

               Matt breaks up. Even Jeannie smiles briefly, then she takes 
               him aside for privacy.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I just found out that we bow before 
                         we even do anything.

                                     MATT
                         Great.

                                     JEANNIE
                         And everybody claps.

                                     MATT
                         Great.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I made up a great bow. You going to 
                         look?

                                     MATT
                         Wouldn't miss it.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I'm not going to be able to cry. 
                         It's too hard for me.

                                     MATT
                         Hey, then they'll just give you more 
                         chances after everyone leaves.

               This does not satisfy her. She rolls her eyes as she is pulled 
               away towards the front of the stage. Matt watches as the 10-
               year-old veteran actor leads his little daughter towards her 
               debut.

               INT. BACKSTAGE - LATE AFTERNOON - MOVING SHOT - BURKE

               MUSIC, a tension-filled version of "Poor Bastard." Burke's 
               stride was never stronger, his posture never worse; head 
               hunched down into his neck. Suddenly, he reacts as he sees: 
               the staff of Popcorn Pictures grouped together backstage. 
               Cathy walking towards the group hurriedly from one direction 
               as Burke approaches from the other. Seeing his staff has 
               clearly moved Burke.

                                     BURKE
                         Look at you. You're all here because 
                         of what's on the line for me tonight. 
                         Having this many people in your corner 
                         helps more than I would have ever 
                         guessed. I'm just very grateful that 
                         I made you come.

               He starts off, but a jubilant Cathy stops him, whispers 
               something. He reacts with excitement.

               MOVING WITH CATHY

               She sees Matt deep in the wings watching the stage. She calls 
               to him with some urgency.

                                     CATHY
                         Matt. Matt. Matt.

               He turns and she beckons him towards her. With some hesitance, 
               he joins her.

                                     MATT
                         I don't want to miss her introduction.

                                     CATHY
                         I'll talk fast. It's amazing news. 
                         Oliver Stone's been looking for a 
                         comedy and...

                                     MATT
                              (distracted)
                         I've got to see my kid.

                                     CATHY
                              (her voice breaking)
                         ...he's doing my picture.

                                     MATT
                         Hey. Good.

               He starts off.

                                     CATHY
                         Part of this involves you. He 
                         remembers you from 'Platoon' and 
                         wants to use you in this one.
                              (he stops)
                         Got your attention, huh?

               Matt is terminally disappointed in her last cynical sentence.

                                     MATT
                         Oh, Cathy. Look, I'm going to watch 
                         this. Let me talk to you later or 
                         tomorrow. Thanks for your help. It's 
                         good news. Gotta go.

               From the stage, we HEAR the VOICE of the WARM-UP MAN.

                                     WARM-UP MAN'S VOICE
                         First, in her first appearance ever, 
                         Jeannie Hobbs...

               There is applause. Matt's missed her intro.

                                     MATT
                         Shit.

                                     CATHY
                         I'm sorry.

                                     MATT
                         Why couldn't you wait till later? 
                         Shit.

                                     CATHY
                              (broadly)
                         I guess it's because I'm just 
                         incredibly insensitive to all human 
                         needs. I'd ask you to save me, but 
                         I'm so far gone, I wouldn't want you 
                         to waste your time.

                                     MATT
                              (after a moment)
                         Huh?

               She reacts, but he walks off, not wanting to get into it. 
               Cathy, however, has had a tricky nerve struck. She continues, 
               biting off each word.

                                     CATHY
                         You know, I don't have a kid or a 
                         mate or a talent.
                              (holding up book bag)
                         I got this.
                              (she's quite upset)
                         And shoot me if I think it's 
                         important.

               MATT'S POV

               Cathy, who looks alone and adorable as we HEAR MUSIC of "THIS 
               LONELY LIFE OF MINE." He puts a comforting hand on her. She 
               speaks nakedly from deep within herself; her eyes downcast.

                                     CATHY
                         You think I'm a superficial jerk.
                              (and then a whispered 
                              afterthought)
                         You can't be right.

                                     MATT
                         I think you're the best of the bunch.

                                     CATHY
                              (broadly)
                         Oh, great.

               And now she raises her eyes--big, blue and vulnerable. If 
               this look were returned, "I love yous" could flow--they could 
               sink to the floor in a joint epiphany; but there is no romance 
               or kindling in Matt's eyes. He is in a hurry. Pridefully, 
               Cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction, her 
               flight so instinctive, she forgets her book bag. We hold on 
               this--her exit, then:

               INT. STUDIO FLOOR - BURKE AND MATT - 20 MINUTES LATER

               Standing just behind the four television cameras, immediately 
               behind them, the "rail" where the Show's Staff and Crew 
               Members and Network Bosses stand crowded, choreographed in 
               the way in which they "clear" for a moving camera. Behind 
               these people is the studio audience. There is a loud laugh. 
               Burke turns around to study the audience.

               BURKE'S POV

               Happy faces accompanied by the strains of Burke's love song 
               to the crowd...

                                     BURKE
                              (to Matt)
                         What do you think?

               But Matt doesn't hear him... a few feet away, Jeannie is 
               making ready for her big moment. Three cameras swing in front 
               of them, TV monitors showing a MASTER and CLOSE-UPS of the 
               three characters in the scene: a short comic WHITE MAN, the 
               Black Female Lead, and Jeannie, dressed as a poor child.

                                     MATT
                              (wide-eyed)
                         Wait. This is it.

               ANGLE - STAGE

                                     JEANNIE
                         It's like everyone is pi... ticked 
                         off at me because I'm not colored.

               The White Man jumps on the phrase.

                                     SHORT WHITE MAN
                              (correcting her 
                              pompously)
                         The word is black.

                                     BLACK LEAD ACTRESS
                              (correcting him with 
                              booming voice)
                         The word is African American.

               A burst of laughter, whooping and applause from the audience. 
               Burke brags in a whisper to Matt.

                                     BURKE
                         I had them bring in two busloads of 
                         people from black churches.

               ANGLE - STAGE

               As they play out the scene.

                                     BLACK LEAD ACTRESS
                              (scolding Jeannie)
                         Now you use it in a sentence.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Look at me, I...

               ON JEANNIE

               And Jeannie begins to falter... she must somehow cry at this 
               moment... She looks outward for help.

               JEANNIE'S POV

               She looks at the Lead Actress giving Jeannie all she can.

               BACK TO JEANNIE

               Jeannie still can't cry. She looks past the cameras.

               JEANNIE'S POV

               Her father nervously pulling for her.

               BACK TO JEANNIE

               That didn't do it either. She looks into herself... she blinks--
               there are tears running down her cheek.

                                     WHOLE AUDIENCE
                         Awwwww.

               GROUP SHOT

               Matt, very much as he was when he watched Brando on the 
               plane... and then some. Burke, craning to make sure the 
               network bosses are suitably transported.

               BACK TO JEANNIE'S SCENE

                                     BLACK LEAD ACTRESS
                         Go ahead. Use it in a sentence.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (crying fully)
                         Look at me. I love an African 
                         American.

                                     BLACK LEAD ACTRESS
                         Look at me. I love a little redneck.

               The Black Lead Actress holds out her arms to Jeannie, who, 
               tears streaming down her face, runs towards the arms...

               ON BURKE

               His lips pursed tightly in pleasure, then agape in shock.

               BURKE'S POV

               Jeannie has run past the Lead Actress and off the set, going 
               into her father's arms instead. She jumps on him, her legs 
               and arms wrapped around him.

               MATT AND JEANNIE

                                     MATT
                              (pridefully)
                         You little stinker!

                                     JEANNIE
                         You big stinker.

                                     MATT
                         My little stinker.

                                     JEANNIE
                         My big stinker.

               The background to this intimacy is enormously alive. The 
               Lead Actress and the Character Actor laughing out loud. In 
               the b.g., we see the audience filling out preview cards as 
               the FLOOR MANAGER leans in to say:

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                         It's okay, Jeannie. Take a minute. 
                         We just need to get that hug at the 
                         end.

                                     MATT
                              (to Floor Manager)
                         Amazing, right?

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                              (to Jeannie)
                         You were great.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Thank you. That's nice.

                                     MATT
                         You look happy.

                                     JEANNIE
                         I loved it, Daddy.

               Matt starts to walk her back to the set.

                                     MATT
                         You want me to put you down?

               Her answer surprises him.

                                     JEANNIE
                         No. This is okay.

                                     MATT
                         Okay... Now, you're not finished 
                         until you hug the lady just like you 
                         did me.

               He puts her down. She turns from him to go back to work but, 
               on impulse, he restrains her. He is kneeling down, holding 
               her lightly by the arms, her back to him as he states an 
               ultimate truth:

                                     MATT
                         I'm very proud of you. I love you 
                         more than anybody.

               Jeannie, shocked by her father's unprecedented sentiment, 
               turns to face him and clamp a hand over his mouth so he will 
               add no more lush and primal affection. Having silenced him 
               though, she finds that she has something of her own to say. 
               She'd never tell it to her father, but she can't resist 
               telling it to her acting coach.

                                     JEANNIE
                         When I had to cry, I thought of you 
                         buried in the ground.

                                     MATT
                              (a beat, then)
                         Give me a kiss.

               She does.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

               The cast of Rainbow House taking off their make-up, changing 
               clothes, etc. This is more than high energy and excitement--
               what's the opposite of trauma? All are off the wall with 
               pleasure--the MUSICAL LIFE of the earlier dressing room scene 
               returning--peaks of glee resulting in sung phrases as before. 
               Jeannie enters and is immediately surrounded with love, 
               attention and ad-libbed compliments about her work. In this 
               glare of good will, Jeannie turns gloriously shy.

                                     BLACK LEAD ACTRESS
                         Do you have any idea how special you 
                         were?
                              (on Jeannie's goony 
                              reaction)
                         That looks like a 'yes.' You've got 
                         to get dressed for the party.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (overwhelmed)
                         There's more?
                              (then)
                         What will I wear?

                                     BLACK LEAD ACTRESS
                         Go to wardrobe; they'll give you 
                         anything you want.

               ON JEANNIE

               She moves to her dressing table--sits, looks in the mirror 
               and giggles uncontrollably.

               INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT

               Matt stands waiting for Jeannie. Nan approaches.

                                     NAN
                         It didn't sell.

                                     MATT
                         This show didn't sell?!? How do you 
                         know so fast?

                                     NAN
                         It's the first time they had me do 
                         cards for a pilot and the demographics 
                         are all wrong for after nine o'clock. 
                         That's their only opening.

               Jeannie exits the make-up room aglow. She is wearing an 
               incredibly stylish outfit and her hair is in an expertly 
               done intricate braid.

                                     NAN
                         Hi. I'm Nan. I'm a good friend of 
                         your Dad's.

                                     JEANNIE
                         Hello, Nan. I'm Jeannie. Did you see 
                         it?

                                     NAN
                              (to Jeannie)
                         Yes, and you were wonderful.

                              (to Jeannie)
                         And knowing that you were that good 
                         means so much more than the show not 
                         going.

                                     JEANNIE
                         What?

                                     NAN
                         Oh, no.
                              (to Matt)
                         I couldn't help it.

                                     JEANNIE
                         What does she mean?
                              (to Nan)
                         What do you mean?
                              (to Matt)
                         What does she mean?
                              (to Nan)
                         What do you mean?

                                     MATT
                         That they're not going to be doing 
                         any more of these shows right now--
                         but...

                                     JEANNIE
                              (struck)
                         Oh, my God.

                                     MATT
                         Honey...

                                     JEANNIE
                         And that means they're not going to 
                         have a party?

                                     MATT
                         No. They're still having the party.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (totally relieved)
                         Oh... really?... good... can we stay 
                         late?

               To which Matt answers:

                                     MATT
                         Honey, we're going to close the place.

               EXT. ROOF GARDEN - NIGHT

               The door to the roof garden opens and Jeannie enters--her 
               dad behind her as she sees the party... the sparkling lights, 
               the decorations, the other kids and MUSIC... our opening 
               song... "WOW".

               ON JEANNIE

               As her father urges her into the flow. She passes Millie, 
               who is dancing with the boy who held Jeannie's hand.

                                     MILLIE
                         I cast him so he has to dance with 
                         me, but I'm sure he'd prefer dancing 
                         with you.

                                     BOY
                              (to Jeannie)
                         Come on. You know how?

                                     JEANNIE
                              (angrily, with disdain)
                         Yesssssss.

               They begin to dance with the others. MUSIC SLOWS IN TEMPO as

               ANGLE ON BURKE AND MATT

               Perched on a ledge eyeing the party.

                                     BURKE
                         I'm not comfortable with television 
                         anyway... it's too small... I'm much 
                         better at something with size... I 
                         don't do itzy. Even this movie of 
                         Cathy's--it's small... medium small. 
                         But with Stone it takes on a certain 
                         volume where I start to feel 
                         comfortable.
                              (out of nowhere)
                         I hate my life...
                              (backtracking)
                         ...in a way. I had a drink in my 
                         office. I'm confused. You're not 
                         saying anything. Is it because you're 
                         not listening or because I haven't 
                         stopped talking?

                                     MATT
                         This Oliver Stone thing... does he 
                         really want me?

                         Yeah. Oh, yeah. I forgot to say 
                         congratu...

                                     MATT
                         Which part?

                                     BURKE
                         Which one you want?

                                     MATT
                         One of the two leads wouldn't be 
                         bad.

                                     BURKE
                         No. It's the crippled factory owner.

                                     MATT
                         Best part in the movie.

               He gets off the ledge and starts to move away... Burke moves 
               quickly to cut him off.

                                     BURKE
                         Wait a second.

                                     MATT
                         I want to see my kid.

                                     BURKE
                         A second--look, they're taking the 
                         cast picture now anyway.

               THEIR POV

               Jeannie, working her way to the absolute middle of the cast 
               picture, where she plops on someone's lap.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     BURKE
                         She doesn't look anything like the 
                         women I usually go with. And you 
                         know what they say, "beauty fades." 
                         What they don't say is that it fades 
                         very slowly.

                                     MATT
                         You don't think I can tell you what 
                         to do?

                                     BURKE
                         No. Only I can do that. I want you 
                         to tell me what to feel...
                              (he begins to use his 
                              fingers to run down 
                              Nan's qualities)
                         Look. I trust her. More important, 
                         everyone does. You have no idea how 
                         impressed people are with her. She's 
                         smart. She's interesting. You never 
                         know what she'll say next... Her 
                         work is amazing. I like talking to 
                         her. You have no idea what to expect 
                         next. I respect what she does more 
                         than any writer or director--sincerely--
                         much more unusual--much more 
                         important. So?

                                     MATT
                         Good luck.

               He walks away. Burke waves a grateful goodbye and looks around 
               the room until he sees:

               BURKE'S POV - NAN ACROSS THE ROOF

               Nan eating cake with her hands. She sees him. He indicates 
               he would like to dance. She does not move a muscle in 
               response... Still, he walks towards her. She begins to shake 
               her head, "no." He shifts uncomfortably, but keeps coming 
               until he reaches her side.

               ON NAN AND BURKE

                                     BURKE
                         Dance with me.
                              (she shakes her head)
                         On a business basis.

                                     NAN
                         No.
                              (he turns away, 
                              dejected)
                         But I'll dance with you because I 
                         think it will reassure me that I 
                         should have nothing to do with you.

                                     BURKE
                         I'll take it.

               As they dance.

                                     NAN
                         Why are you breathing so heavy?

                                     BURKE
                         Nervous... Look, let's move our thing 
                         in a more regular direction.

                                     NAN
                         What do you mean?

                                     BURKE
                         Let me think.
                              (then)
                         What if we go out this weekend...
                              (before she can say 
                              "no")
                         ...with your kid.

               Several more beats of dancing--as he awaits her answer.

                                     NAN
                         ...whose name is?

                                     BURKE
                         Whose name is...
                              (then, triumphantly)
                         Leslie.

                                     NAN
                         Okay.

               SONG BACK--"WOW"... sung as a chorus... a slower cadence for 
               the romance as we... CHANGE MUSIC and they dance more closely. 
               The song slows for time passage and MUSIC CHANGES to "BE MY 
               MIRROR" as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DESERTED POPCORN PICTURES ROOM - ONE HOUR LATER

               Matt and Jeannie--the last ones there. He holds her in his 
               arms, dancing. She is asleep. He dances her to a chair with 
               her wrap on it... shifts her around, wrestling to get it on. 
               She wakes up and puts it on herself.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (looking around 
                              satisfied)
                         Last ones here.

                                     MATT
                         Well, I told you.

               He takes her hand and starts to lead her towards the stair 
               shed--then:

                                     MATT
                         I never got to see your bow.

               She looks up, smiling pridefully, to see her father smiling 
               back pridefully.

                                     JEANNIE
                              (as if it's a great 
                              sacrifice)
                         Oh, all right.

               She bows. It is a bow all her own.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
IN THE LOOP

1   EXT. 10 DOWNING STREET LONDON - MORNING                     1

    MALCOLM TUCKERS, government director of communications,
    is arriving early.


2   INT. NUMBER TEN CORRIDOR/MALCOLM'S OFFICE - MORNING         2

    A CIVIL SERVANT hands Malcolm a CD.

                           CIVIL SERVANT
              Monitoring. All the usual.

                           MALCOLM
              How did your team do at the weekend?

                           CIVIL SERVANT
              Yeah, alright. We won.

                            MALCOLM
              Great.
                     (to himself)
              Wanker.

    Malcolm reaches his office. His assistant SAM is there.

                           MALCOLM (CONT'D)
              Sam. Morning.

    He hands her the CD and she puts it into a CD player.

                           MALCOLM (CONT'D)
              Well, pop pickers....what Shall we start
              with today? Wonky Ron....or Simon Foster,
              on the PM programme for the BBC.
    Malcolm starts listening to the recording of Simon on the
    radio.

                           EDDIE MAIR (ON RADIO)
              Well, I'm joined by Simon Foster, the
              Minister for International development.
              Thank you for joining us.

                            MALCOLM
              Here we go.

                           EDDIE MAIR
              You've been in the job now for eighteen
              months, do you think you're making
              headway?

                           SIMON
                     (v/o on radio)
              Ah. Yes I do. You'd expect me to say that
              I suppose.

3   INT. DIFED OPEN PLAN OFFICE. DAY                             3

    Judy Malloy, the Department's Press Officer, is preparing
    for her minister's arrival.

                           JUDY
              Mark, are you co-ordinating that
              millenium goals press release?

                             MARK
              Yes.

                           JUDY
              Well co-ordinate it better.

                             MARK
              Yes, can do.

                           JUDY
              Is that the Minister? Bloody nail - has
              anyone got a nail file?


4   INT. DFID OPEN PLAN OFFICE. DAY.                             4

    SIMON is arriving with JUDY. Simon carrying his red
    dispatch box. Simon's worried.

                           SIMON
              Have we heard anything from Malcolm about
              last night's interview?

                             JUDY
              No not yet.
                           SIMON
              Perhaps he didn't hear it.

                           JUDY
              Or maybe he's dead.

                            SIMON
                     (with a degree of genuine
                      hope)
              He might be dead. He might have had that
              massive stroke we've all been waiting
              for. It's in the post.


5   INT. MALCOLM'S OFFICE. DAY.                                  5

                           SIMON (ON RADIO)
              ...preventable sickness in many of the
              poorest countries round the world....and
              Of course the big one is diarrhoea, which
              is a major, major issue....

                                MALCOLM
                   Diarrhoea? I mean, this is the minister
                   for International Development. He should
                   be talking about food parcels, not
                   fucking arse-spraying mayhem.

    SAM laughs.

                                SIMON (ON RADIO)
                   And so if we can tackle the easy things,
                   like diarrhoea, then we can.....

                                MALCOLM
                   Oh yes, say it again. Very good. What is
                   this, The Shitting Forecast?

                                SIMON (ON RADIO)
                   ...and then hopefully that will strike
                   another blow in the war against
                   preventable diseases.
                                EDDIE MAIR
                   You mentioned the word `war"

    MALCOLM is paying extremely close attention now.

                                MALCOLM
                   Steady Eddie...

                                SIMON (ON RADIO)
                   Against preventable diseases, yes....

                                EDDIE MAIR (ON RADIO)
                   Yes. All the evidence now points to a US
                   military intervention in the Middle East.
                   Is that you view?

                                SIMON (ON RADIO)
                   Well....personally, I think that war is
                   unforseeable.

                                  MALCOLM
                   Sam! Sam!

                                EDDIE MAIR (ON RADIO)
                   Unforseeable?

                                  SIMON (ON RADIO)
                   Yes.

                                MALCOLM
                   NO YOU DO NOT THINK THAT! Sam! I'm going
                   to have to go over to International
                   Development, and pull Simon Foster's
                   fucking hair.

6   EXT. 10 DOWNING STREET LONDON. DAY.                          6

    MALCOLM emerges into the street. On the phone.

                           MALCOLM
              He did not say "unforseeable'. You may
              have heard him say it, but he did not say
              that, and that is a fact.


7   INT. DFI OPEN PLAN OFFICE. DAY.                              7

                           JUDY
              He'll want you to row back from the
              `unforeseeable' thing on Question Time
              tonight.

                           SIMON
              On Question Time, you know the funny
              question they always ask at the end?

                             JUDY
              Yes?

                           SIMON
              I think we should prep that now. I'd like
              to shine on the funny question, cos I'm a
              funny guy. With a light touch.

    SIMON deposits his briafcase. Judy finds some clippings,
    returns.

                           JUDY
              There's this guy, he's a property tycoon.
              He's bought a South Sea Island. It might
              be something like that, you know. "If you
              had to spend the rest of your life on a
              desert island, who would it be with?"

                           SIMON
              Ah. Well, I can't say my wife, because I
              haven't got one, and I can't say my
              girlfriend, because I haven't got one of
              those either.

                           JUDY
              And don't say Mandela, that's...

                           SIMON
              No. Boring. And a bloke.

                           JUDY
              Or Keira Knightley.

                           SIMON
              Well, that's a good idea.

                   I don't think so.

                                JUDY
                   People don't want to know.


8   EXT. STREET NEAR WHITEHALL. DAY.                                 8

    Toby and Suzy walking to work together.

                                SUZY
                   Did you take the washing out of the
                   machine?

                                 TOBY
                   No.
                                SUZY
                   What do you mean, no?

                                TOBY
                   No. I didn't take the washing out of the
                   machine.

                                SUZY
                   It's going to go really stale.

                                TOBY
                   It'll be fine.

                                SUZY
                   It's not fine. By the time...

                                TOBY
                   It is fine. I'll wear stale pants.

                                SUZY
                   I don't want to go out with some who
                   wears stale pants.

                                TOBY
                   Well, there we go. I could go commando,
                   but I don't think that's acceptable in
                   government.

                                SUZY
                          (Disgusted)
                   Please. So: got everything you need for
                   your first day in International
                   Development?

                   Oh Yes. It's all here. My massive
                   intellect. And an apple for Simon Foster.

                                SUZY
                   Simon Fluster.

                                TOBY
                   Don't say that, I'm rebranding him.

                                SUZY
                   Well he was crap on the radio last night.
                   He sounded like a chicken with a wasp up
                   its arse.

                                TOBY
                   Well I'm going to sort that out. After a
                   week I'll have him sounding like a
                   chicken without a wasp up its arse.
                                SUZY
                   Have a good day, good luck honey.

                                TOBY
                   Have a good day at the Foreign Office.
                   Try not to annoy Russia.

                                SUZY
                   I'll give you a call later. Keep your
                   phone on. Bye.

                                TOBY
                   Yeah, alright.

                                SUZY
                   Oh and be careful - cars!

    They walk off in separate directions.


9   MORNING/INT. MICHAEL'S FO OFFICE - MORNING                        9

    Toby is walking towards DFID. As he nears the building he
    finds himself next to Malcolm, who is heading in too.
    Toby is on the phone.

                                               INTERCUT PHONE CALL:

                                TOBY
                   Are you going to keep ringing me up every
                   two minutes, because you're starting to
                   remind me of my mum. And that could lead
                   to all sorts of erectile dysfunction.

    Suzy is still in the FO office.

                                SUZY
                   I'm just checking whether you put last
                   night's lasagne in the fridge.

    In the FO office, MICHAEL arrives. He has a small
    suitcase and a paper bag. He holds this up.

                                MICHAEL
                          (mouthing)
                   Croissants!

    Back with Malcolm, Toby close by. Malc's on the phone.

                                MALCOLM
                   No. You're fine to go ahead and print
                   that. It's lies, you'd be lying, but go
                   ahead. He did not say unforeseeable. No
                   he did not. Oh, just before you go --
                   when I tell your wife about you and
                   Angela Heaney at the Blackpool
                   conference...would email be better? Or a
                   phone call? Or, hey I know, I'll write it
                   on a cake, "Your hack husband betrayed
                   you on the 4th of October, and
                   congratulations on the new baby" in those
                   little silver balls. (BEAT) Yeah, maybe
                   best to spike it? Okay. Fuckity-bye!

    Toby is now next to Malcolm in the building (or better
    still, in a lift). Malcolm becomes aware of him.

                                TOBY
                   No, it's fine, it's in the fridge. I put
                   some clingfilm over it.
    In the FO office, Michael switches on some classical
    music.

                                SUZY
                   Why did you put clingfilm on it?

                                TOBY
                   To keep it fresh.

    Malcolm starts dialling on his phone.

                                SUZY
                   It's in the fridge, that'll keep it
                   fresh.

                                TOBY
                   No, but it still might dry out.

                                MALCOLM
                          (into phone)
                   Yeah, Malcolm Tucker. Can I speak to
                   James Lewis at the PM Programme please?

                            MICHAEL
                      (knowing Toby is on the other
                       end of the line)
               Still slightly warm. That's how I like
               my women as well.

                            SUZY
               Clingfilm is carcinogenic, Toby.

                            TOBY
               No it isn't. That's a myth. Clingfilm is
               perfectly safe.

     Malcolm now eyeing Toby with suspicion/contempt -- who is
     this dick? Toby tries to smile, lowers his voice,
     embarrassed.

                            MALCOLM
                      (into phone)
               No, I'll hold,. what's he waiting for?     A
               sex-change?

                            TOBY
               They wouldn't sell clingfilm if it gave
               you cancer. Clingfilm doesn't give you
               cancer. And Lasagne doesn't give you
               syphillis.

                            MALCOLM
               James! Right --Simon Foster? Yeah, very
               funny, the Diarrhoea of a Nobody. Listen,
               we get an easy ride on Tom tomorrow, OK?
               (getting annoyed) No, YOU relax. Tell
               you what, I'll come over a lock you in a
               flotation tank and pump it full of sewage
               until you drown. GET ME FUCKING BRIAN!

                    Shit. He's still alive. When's he due?
     Malcolm walks in with Toby sheepishly behind him.

                                 MALCOLM
                    Now. And don't say you weren't prepared

                    Right. Just most of you lot tend to be
                    called Dan, or Danny, so it's always
                    worth a punt. OK, hello. As you know, I'm

                    Is this a normal morning, or...?

     Judy's not got time for questions.

                                 JUDY
                    Okay, I've got a meeting in
                           (looks at watch)
                    two minutes. And the minister was
                    rubbish in last night's interview.

                                TOBY
                    Rubbish?

                                 JUDY
                    It's a technical term. It means he went
                    on the radio and everyone could hear that
                    he was rubbish.

     Someone goes into Simon's office. As door opens we hear
     heated conversation between Simon and Malcolm.

                                 MALCOLM [IN OFFICE]
                    You sounded like a panicky chimp trapped

12   INT. DFID SIMON'S OFFICE. DAY.                                 12

     Back inside Simon's office.

                                 SIMON
                    Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for a
                    personal opinion.
                                 MALCOLM
                    Oh why didn't you say? I mean, he asked
                    you. Fuck. Of course, that explains it.
                    Yeah. Say, if he'd asked you to fucking
                    black up, or give him your PIN number, or
                    shot yourself, would you have done that
                    as well.

                                 SIMON
                    I would have blacked up. It was the radio
                    and no-one would have known.

                                 MALCOLM
                    Yeah. Very good.

                                 SIMON
                    But war is -- basically unforeseeable
                    isn't it?

                                 MALCOLM
                    That is not our line, alright? Walk the
                    fucking line. Look.

                    We've got Karen Clark over from
                    Washington, okay? We've got the US
                    National Security Advisor's main guy
                    coming. Yeah? We've got enough Pentagon
                    goons here for a fucking coup d'etat.
                    This is not the time to send out a signal
                    like this in some personal fucking
                    sodcast.

     JUDY and TOBY come in.

                                 JUDY
                    Minister, this is Toby.

                                 MALCOLM
                    Not the time love. Fuck off.

     JUDY smiles at MALCOLM, and doesn't fuck off.

                                 SIMON
                    Hey Toby. Glad you could join us. Bit of
                    an odd morning, but 'Welcome to the
                    madhouse!'I apologise for Malcolm.

                                 MALCOLM
                    Don't apologise for me. You should
                    apologise for yourself.
                           (to Judy)
                    Did I not just tell you to fuck off and
                    yet you're still here?

                                 JUDY
                    That's correct.

                                 MALCOLM
                           (to Toby)
                    Hey, foetus boy. Lesson One: If I tell
                    you to fuck off what do you do?

                                TOBY
                    Fuck off?

                                 MALCOLM
                    You'll go far.Now fuck off.

                                TOBY
                    Right.

     Toby fucks off. We can see him outside, wandering around,
     not knowing what to do with himself.

                                 SIMON
                    We were thinking, weren't we Judy, that I
                    could row back on Question Time tonight.

                                 MALCOLM
                    No, You're not going on Question Time
                    tonight. You've been disinvited.

                            SIMON
               Why? We've been prepping Question Time.

                            MALCOLM
               Because they ask fucking questions on
               Question Time. And you're no good at
               questions. If it was Fumbling, Off-
               Message Shit Fucking Answer Time, you'd
               be our main guy. But it's not.

                            JUDY
               Sorry, why wasn't I told about this?

                            MALCOLM
               Why should I tell you about this?

                            JUDY
               Because it's a scheduled media appearance
               by this department's Secretary Of State
               and it therefore falls within my
               purview...

                            MALCOLM
               Your purview? Where do you think you are
               sweetheart, in some Regency costume
               drama? This is a government department,
               not a fucking Jane Austen novel. Allow me
               to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your
               purview and ram it up the shitter with a
               lubricated horse cock.

                            JUDY
               Malcolm, your swearing doesn't impress
               me. My husband works for Tower Hamlets
               and believe me, those kids make you sound
               like Angela Lansbury.

                            MALCOLM
                      (to Simon, lads' chat)
               She's married? The poor bastard.

                            SIMON
               But...okay, Judy's lubricated horse cock
               aside for one moment....
                      (Judy walks out)
               Are you saying that I'm now not allowed
               to make any media appearances?

                            MALCOLM
               No, not until we can trust you to keep to
               the line.

                            SIMON
               But I was going to keep to the line: "I
               don't actually think war is
               unforeseeable."

     Malcolm's looking out of the office, monitoring Judy's
     movements. She's flashed up on his radar. He's tracking
     her.

                            MALCOLM
               What is it then?

     A beat.

                            SIMON
               Is it...I don't know? Foreseeable? No.

                            MALCOLM
               No. Not foreseeable. That's fucking
               declaring war. Do you want to fucking
               declare war?

                            SIMON
               I'm a cabinet minister. I didn't get here
               by screwing up every media appearance I
               ever had.

                            MALCOLM
               Write this down. It's neither forseeable
               nor undorseeable.

                            SIMON
               Right. So not inevitable, but
               not...evitable.

     Malcolm leaves the office. Toby is still hovering.

                            MALCOLM
                      (calling back to Simon)
               Okay, you need to work on this fucking
               line.
                      (to Judy)
               That includes you, Jane Fucking Austen
               with the strap-on. Oh, and put the sniff
               out there that the next time the BBC
               ambushes a Minister with a war question
               we'll drop a bomb on them.

                            JUDY
               I can't do that. That's political, that's
               not in my...

                            MALCOLM
               Purview, Marie Antoinette? Weel listen,
               darling, why don't you fucking scuttle
               off back to fucking Cranford and play
               around with your tea and cake and horse
               cocks. Let them eat cock! (TO TOBY) You,
               Ron Weasley -- you do it.

     Malcolm heads out.

               You needn't worry about the Canadians.
               They're just happy to be there. (Pause)
               Yes, well, they always look surprised
               when they're invited.

                            SUZY

     again, I'm a bit busy here. He answers.

               Hiya. You do know this is the third time
               you've rung? Are you on a new tariff?

               yet?
                            TOBY
               All a bit manic. It was never like this
               at Agriculture. People tend not to swear
               so much about wheat. Apart from farmers.
               They swear about everything.

               Look, I've got a leg up for you. I think
               we could get Simon into the big meeting
               with Karen Clark?

                    the room. Don't get his hopes up.

                    getting a real meeting unless there's
                    thirty of you on each side. So Simon

                    Sort of one of those. But you might not
                    want to tell him that. I ought to go. I

                                 JUDY
                    There's a lot of really important people
                    you need to know about, but I haven't got
                    time.

     But she's gone. Toby heads over to Simon's office. The
     door's open. He pops his head in.
                                 TOBY
                    Hey, boss.

                                 SIMON
                    Toby, hi. Sorry about earlier -- Malcolm.
                    He's a bit of an...alpha male, isn't he?

                                 TOBY
                    Look, I've managed to get you into the
                    big meeting at the Foreign Office this
                    afternoon.

                                 SIMON
                    The Karen Clark meeting? Shit, really?
                    Sure. How did you...?

                                 TOBY
                    I did it through sheer bloody hard work.

     Judy walks past. Simon calls out.

                            SIMON
               Hey Judy.

     She comes in.

                            JUDY
               Hello?

                            SIMON
               Tobes here has got me into the big Karen
               Clark meeting.

     Judy looks at Toby. She heard the `meat' conversation.

                            JUDY
               Wow. Yeah, the Big Meet. How are you
               spelling that, by the way?

                            TOBY
               Two `e's.

16   EXT. FOREIGN OFFICE. DAY                                    16

     Simon, Toby and Judy drive along Whitehall in their car.

     An awkward silence.

     Judy looks at Toby. She knows Simon's just off to be
     meat.

                            TOBY
                      (off Judy's look)
               Just, maybe, might be best not to get too
               excited. It might be that their guys
               muscle in and have the lion's share of
               the talk time.

                            JUDY
               Yeah. It might be like that.

                            SIMON
               I think I can work a room, okay? I'm not
               a room virgin.


17   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE BUILDING. FOYER - DAY                   17

     Simon, Toby and Judy are going through security. Suzy and
     Michael come to meet them.

                            MICHAEL
               Simon.

                            SIMON
               Michael.

17   CON TINUE D:                                                   17


     A very young man approaches Michael. Looks like he is 19.
     He is CHAD.

                                 CHAD
                    Ah, Michael? I'm Chad.

                                MICHAEL
                    Hello?

                                 CHAD
                    We'd like a dual horse-shoe formation for
                    the meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms
                    Clark, an enclave for the Pentagon
                    delegation. First names acceptable to all
                    parties and politely we request the
                    presence of both carbonated and non-
                    carbonated waters.

                                SUZY
                    Right.
                                 CHAD
                    Thanks so much.

     He walks purposefully off.

                                 MICHAEL
                    My God. Who was that, Young Lankenstein?

                                 JUDY
                    Oh he'll be running something relatively
                    major. They're all kids in Washington.
                    It's like Bugsy Malone, but with real
                    guns.

18   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE GRAND MEETING ROOM      - DAY              18

     Chad's dual horse-shoe is packed with people. The room's
     pretty much full.

     KAREN CLARK from the State Department is surrounded by
     ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and
     assistants. (Including Chad and LIZA one of Karen's
     senior aides.) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of
     advisors, smaller but sitting separately.

     Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including
     uniformed members of all three services.

     Lots of hubbub.

     SUZY leads SIMON, TOBY and JUDY in, and shows them to
     their seats.



                                                          Page 18

     They're as far away from the US delegation as it's
     possible to be, and Simon's seat is actually behind a
     pillar. Suzy goes off to join Michael and the Foreign
     Office delegation near the front. Suzy looks over to
     Toby, uses her hands to make mock binoculars, as if to
     say, 'you're very far away, look how close and therefore
     important I am'.

                                 SIMON
                    No-one will hear me if I say anything.
                    How's your view? Can we swap?

     Simon and Toby swap seats, but Simon can still barely see
     anything.

                                 SIMON (CONT'D)
                           (to Judy)
                    Can I swap with you?

                                 JUDY
                    I think the meeting's starting.

     It is.

                                 SIMON
                    Well, quickly then, swap.

     Simon and Judy swap seats.

     The meeting is now underway. We're with Karen Clark.

                                 KAREN
                    We all agree this is a very tough time,
                    but I don't want a consensus to form
                    around the premise that conflict is
                    necessarily the primary option at this
                    point.

     Back with Simon, Judy and Toby. Simon still straining to
     see.

                                 SIMON
                    Are people thinking that? That's -- a bit
                    hardcore.

     He cranes again to see.

                                 SIMON (CONT'D)
                    No, this is worse. Swap back.

     Simon and Judy swap seats again.

     Back with Karen. She's holding up a paper in a red
     folder.

18   CON TINUE D: (2)                                          18


                            KAREN
               This paper, authored by one of my aides,
               Liza Weld. You don't mind me fore-
               grounding this do you Liza?

     Liza reacts. Her paper? In a big meeting. Is this good or
     bad?

                            KAREN (CONT'D)
               Illuminates the logistical factors we
               face. She highlights a number of reasons
               why, in practical terms, we can't
               envision a theatre deployment for twelve
               months.

                            BOB ADRIANO
               Although not everyone might agree with
               the assumptions made in that paper.

                            KAREN
               Really - such as what?

                            BOB ADRIANO
               The committee feels a much quicker
               deployment is possible.

                            KAREN
               Which committee?

                            BOB ADRIANO
                      (covering)
               This has been discussed in a number of
               committees. If I said one committee...

                            KAREN
               You did.

                            ADRIANO
               Then that was a slip of the tongue

                            KAREN
               Have you accidentally alluded to some
               secret committee? A war committee?

                            MICHAEL
               If I can interject here, I'm aware we're
               pushed for time. I'd like to move us on
               agenda-wise. Our next item is
               international relief co-ordination.

     Karen is conferring with Liza, Adriano with his guy.

                            KAREN
               Have you heard of this committee?

                            ADRIANO
               What's this Liza Weld paper?

     Simon is watching, feeling the meeting is passing him by.

                            SIMON
                      (to Judy and Toby)
               Should I say something? She invited me, I
               should say something. If you don't say
               something in the first 10 minutes, you
               can end up not saying anything at all.

                            JUDY
               I don't know whether you should say
               anything.

                            SIMON
               I'm saying something ... I think I'm
               going to try saying something.

     Simon goes to put his hand up, Toby maybe puts a calming
     hand on his hand. They look at one another. Has Toby
     crossed a line?
                            KAREN
               Look - I just think it's worth noting
               that Ministers in The UK Government,
                      (Liza whispers - Simon's over
                       there)
               such as our colleague here ...

                            SIMON
                      (pleased)
               Is she talking about me?

                            KAREN
               Simon Foster ...
                            SIMON
               She's talking about me!

                            KAREN
               Has made it clear that for them currently
               war is unforeseeable. Isn't that right
               Simon?

                            SIMON
               Well, yes, I mean, that's what I said.
               And I stick to what I said.

     SIMON sits down. Them stands back up.

                            SIMON (CONT'D)
               But that doesn't mean that what I said
               won't ever change. It's not imutable. Or
               mutable. It's an ongoing ...

                            MICHAEL
                      (cutting in)
               I wonder if there aren't some area of
               mutual agreement we can't rattle through
               here and see how much time we have at the
               end for this discussion?

     He's ended the debate.

     Suzy comes round the back of the meeting all smiles and
     hands Judy a note with a smile.

                              JUDY
               Thanks.

     She opens the note it reads, `Simon is acting like a
     massive tit. Stop him.'

                            SUZY
               Is that all fine?
                            JUDY
               That's all fine. Thanks for that.

                              SUZY
               Thanks.

     Toby whispers something in Simon's ear. Simon doesn't
     look pleased. Karen is still talking to the meeting.
     Simon shuts up. He'll have this out later.


19   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE BALLROOM    - DAY                        19

     The big meeting is breaking up. Simon is annoyed, leading
     Judy and Toby out of the room and into any private space
     he can find - they back into a huge huge ballroom

                            SIMON
               Come here - we need to talk
                      (they go into the massive
                       room, look around)
               What do you mean stop being a `tit'? In
               what way was I being a tit? Why am I even
               over here if I'm not meant to say
               anything?

                            JUDY
               You were just meat in the room, Simon.

                            SIMON
               'Meat in the room'? Oh for fuck's sake
               Judy. I took an hour out to come over
               here and be room meat?

                                 TOBY
                    But you know you're a prime cut, you're
                    not - offal.

                                 SIMON
                    Great, I'm not liver. What was I, tit
                    meat?


20   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE LOBBY - DAY                                  20

     We're with Karen Clark's delegation who have just walked
     downstairs from the meeting room into a ground floor
     lobby area. KAREN is talking to LIZA, her right-hand
     woman.

     TOBY, SIMON and JUDY are above them standing round a
     circular viewing area that looks down on the lobby.

     The UK and US delegations are aware of each other,
     throwing furtive glances each other's way.

                                 KAREN
                    Whichever committee they don't want me to
                    be a member of, I want to be a member of
                    that. It's a confused Groucho Marx.

                                   LIZA
                    Okay. Right.

     Chad arrives. Karen talks to someone else.

                                 CHAD
                    Hey Liza. Your paper got a major
                    citation. You must be psyched Karen
                    brought it up.

                                 LIZA
                    She...that was her call. I didn't know it
                    had been that widely read.

                                 CHAD
                    You could not write anything that clashes
                    more violently with the current climate
                    than you the one you wrote if you were
                    trying, and it almost seems like you were
                    trying.

                                 LIZA
                    I wasn't trying, believe me.

                                 CHAD
                    You are like the woman from The Omen,
                    you've given birth to a demon and it's
                    going to kill you.

                                 LIZA
                    You probably identify with the kid from
                    The Omen right?

                                   CHAD
                    Ooh.

                                 LIZA
                    See, you're an only child, aren't you?

                                 CHAD
                    You bring this up whenever you run out of
                    arguments. I don't see how my parents'
                    limited reproductive abilities reflects
                    badly on me. I'm the sperm that made it.

     Liza walks off, over to Karen.

                                 CHAD (CONT'D)

                                 KAREN
                    My teeth hurt. I think the veneers are
                    chipped. Do they look chipped?

     Liza stares into Karen's mouth.

                                 LIZA
                    Well, I think that one, that one's always
                    been there, right? I'm not sure. Have you

     She knows him but can't immediately place him.

               Toby? It's Toby.

                            LIZA
               Hi. Hi.

     She makes the phone sign. He gives a thumbs up, she
     thinks he's misread the phone sign and gestures, or email
     by doing typing in the air. Toby signs back, yeah, call
     on the phone or email - does the typing back.

                            JUDY
                      (re the typing gesture)
               What are you doing? You look like    you're

               She did the Kennedy scholarship at my
               college. I had a small thing for her.

                            JUDY
               I can imagine.

                            TOBY
               I'm not sure she remembered me.

               The voices in his head are now singing
               barbershop together.

     The conversation is continuing between Simon Judy and
     Toby as they exit the FO.

                            SIMON
               Yeah. Jesus. I really really hope there's
               not a war. It's going to be a nightmare.
               It's bad enough having to cope with the
               fucking Olympics.

     They appear outside. There's a press pack of 10 or so
     reporters and photographers there.

                            PRESS
               Minister!/Simon!/Mr Foster!

     Simon is taken aback.

                            SIMON
               Fuck. Who let the dogs out? We don't need
               this.

                            JUDY
               Er, you wanted a chance to row back on
               the war. Do you want to nail the line?

                            SIMON
               What? No. No. I'll freestyle it.

     The press are calling.

                            REPORTER 1
               Is war unforeseeable Minister?

                              SIMON
               Look,
                      (grappling now)
               ...loads of things that are actually very
               likely are also unforeseeable. Y'know,
               For the plane in the fog the mountain is
               unforeseeable, but then it, is suddenly
               very real and inevitable.

     Toby and Judy look at one another. This isn't good.

     The press pack are looking for more.

                                 REPORTER
                    Sorry, are you saying that...?

                                 SIMON
                    What I'm saying is that to - walk the
                    road of peace, sometimes you need to be
                    ready to climb the mountain of conflict.
                    Thank you!

     The press are writing furiously, making calls already.
     Simon tries to look confident. He and the team get into
     their car.

                    Why didn't we nail the line?

                                 JUDY
                    I did try to warn you.

                                 SIMON
                    You did try to warn me but you didn't
                    actually stop me, did you?. That's like
                    shouting 'Train!' as I get hit by a
                    train. You should go
                           (stupid voice)
                    'Look! Train! There's a Fucking Train!'

     JUDY'S and SIMON'S phones start ringing. They each check
     the number.

                    How does he do that?

     Malcolm has two phones on the go. He's watching the SKY
     NEWS coverage of Simon's mini-press coverage. It has a
     `Government ready to Climb the Mountain of Conflict'
     banner running across the top.

                            MALCOLM
                      (on the phone, over TV)
               Simon.   I don't like finding out about
               people I work with via the news, unless
               they've died. Get over here now so we
               can address at least one of those issues.

     Judy, Simon and Toby are walking towards Malcolm's
     office.
                            TOBY
               The thing is. On the war. With your
               profile..
                      (uncertain, but fuck it, he
                       is a senior policy aide to a

               ... Maybe we should - get it out there?
               That the war is a resigning issue for
               you.

                            SIMON
               You can't say it's a resigning issue.
               Because you then have to resign.
                            JUDY
               You are having a really great first day
               you know that?

     They walk in, Malcolm's there.

                            MALCOLM
                      (shouting)
               You are supposed to be a Cabinet Minster.
               You are supposed to be officer class.
               Don't do this. Don't make waves.

                            SIMON
               We can do without the ritual humiliation,
               Malcolm. You know I'm against talking up
               the war.

                            MALCOLM
               You're against talking up the war? Is
               that why you said, "Climb the mountain of

                    sounded like a fucking Nazi Julie
                    Andrews.

                                 SIMON
                    I'm just saying. I might be forced to the
                    verge of making a stand.

                                 MALCOLM
                           (different tack needed)

                    Right, you two, The White Stripes,
                    outside.

     Simon makes to leave with them.

                                 MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                    There's only two people in the White
                    Stripes.

     Toby and Judy leave and wait outside the door.
                                 MALCOLM (CONT'D, TO SIMON)
                                 (CONT'D)
                    Look, I admire you, I really do. Making a
                    stand. So, I take it I can tell the PM
                    you don't want to go to Washington?

                                   SIMON
                    To where...?

                                 MALCOLM
                    Washington. The boss wants you over there
                    on a fact-finder. Problems we might face
                    if it all goes boombastic in the Middle
                    East.
                                   SIMON
                    Oh. Right.

                                 MALCOLM
                    But you were saying, you are on the verge
                    of your stand...

                                 SIMON
                    Well, look - I don't know what words I
                    used in the heat of the moment, but maybe
                    in a sense I was on the verge. But that's
                    the important thing - I was on the verge.
                    Not in any way decided.

                                 MALCOLM
                    Christ on a bendy-bus, Simon, stop being

                            MALCOLM
               Well, when you go to America, talk to
               Karen Clarke at the State Department,

                            SIMON
               I'll give it a whirl.

                            MALCOLM
               But keep away from Linton Barwick. He's
               pushing the war for Caulderwood's lot.
               I'll deal with him. Dangerous fucker.
               keeps a live hand-grenade as a
               paperweight. True story.

                              SIMON
               Oh right.    I won't talk to him.

                            MALCOLM
               Talk to as few people as possible. That
               would be best for you.

31   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY                                 31

     Liza, Karen and Chad arrive in the buzzing State
     Department offices, knackered but in action mode.

                            KAREN
               Okay - so, priorities are: take a shower,
               get me on Linton's War Committee, get me
               a dental appointment. Not necessarily in
               that order.

     Karen walks past various desks covered in tons of Post-
     Its. Stops a STAFFER as he passes.
                            KAREN (cont'd) (CONT'D)
               What's Linton been up to while we've been
               away....have we declared war on
               California yet?

     But before the staffer can answer they run right into
     Linton. Karen stands her ground.

                             LINTON
               Ah. Karen.

                             KAREN
               Linton.

                            LINTON
               How was London? Good hotel?

                            KAREN
               Great hotel, thank you.

                    Good meetings?

                                 KAREN
                    Yes. We had some good discussions. The
                    time at Number Ten could possibly have
                    been better spent but then...

     Karen realises that Linton is reading a message on his
     cell phone and not listening.

                                 LINTON
                    Good. Welcome back. I'll read your words
                    when they come through. Thank you so much

     Linton heads off to his office. A beat later so does
     Karen. Chad goes off a little towards Linton's office.

                                 KAREN
                    Is Chad coming... ?
                                 LIZA
                           (watching)
                    He's doing his desperate chorus girl
                    thing, hanging around trying to catch
                    Linton's eye. That's why he's wearing his
                    push-up bra today.

                                 CHAD
                           (as he passes)
                    Assistant Secretary of State -- hi.

                                   CHAD
                    Chad

                                 LINTON
                    Uh-huh. Exactly

                                   CHAD
                    Can I...?

     Linton ignores him as he goes to join Bob Adriano waiting
     for him in his office.

                                 KAREN
                    So listen, Liza, I need you to find out
                    the names of the ten dullest committees
                    currently operating on the hill.

                            KAREN
               Because Linton is not going to call it
               the big horrible scarey war
               committee...they'll have buried the war
               committee under the most boring name they
               can think of. 'Diverse Strategy
               Committee'- not that, I'm on that. But
               it'll be a committee that sounds so
               tedious you want to self-harm.

     They glance over into Linton's area. He is glancing into
     theirs.

               Hi. I'm calling from Karen Clark's office
               about a paper written by a staffer here.
               We need to know if 'Post War Planning:
               Parameters, Implication's and
               Possibilities' has reached Assistant
               Secretary of State Linton Barwick yet?

               Yeah...by Liza Weld.
                      (listens, shit!)
               'Pwip Pip'? It's already been given an
               acronym?
                      (listens)
               No I don't want to fast-track it. Would
               it possible to slow-track it? Well can we
               create one?


32   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT. LINTON'S OFFICE - DAY                32

     Looking over at Karen. Now alone, who is still stealing
     glances over.

                            LINTON
               I do not understand why anyone would
               choose to work in a glass office. In my
               opinion glass offices are for perverts.

                            BOB ADRIANO
               I could request the glass be frosted?

                           (as if Bob Adriano brought it
                            up)
                    Frosting is for cakes, Bob. Now. What
                    happened in London?

                                 BOB ADRIANO
                    Generally positive. Two glitches. Karen
                    flagged a report by one of her staffers -
                    Liza. She's obviously trying to use it as
                    some kind of roadblock. It's called Pwip
                    Pip.

                                LINTON
                    Pip what?

                                BOB ADRIANO
                    Pwip Pip.

                                 LINTON
                    What is that a report on - birdcalls?
                    What does that stand for?

                                 BOB ADRIANO
                    I don't recall. It's factish. Intel -
                    case for and against intervention.

                                 LINTON
                    We've got all the facts we need on this.
                    In the land of truth, my friend, the man
                    with one fact is king. You said there was
                    another thing?

                                 BOB ADRIANO
                    In the meeting with the Foreign Office
                    the Committee was accidentally briefly
                    alluded to.

                                  LINTON
                           (putting his hand over his
                            mouth so he can't be lip-
                            read)
                    Which committee?

                                 BOB ADRIANO
                           (doing the same)
                    The war committee.

                                 LINTON
                    Karen must not find out about that. She
                    is an excitable yapping she-dog. Okay get
                    the minutes of the meeting, we need to
                    correct the record.

                                 BOB ADRIANO
                    We can do that?

                            LINTON
               Yes we can. They're an aide memoir for
               us. So they should not be a reductive
               record of what happened to be said, but a
               more full record of what was intended to
               be said. I think that's the more accurate
               version, right?

     LATER. Bob Adriano is going through the minutes with
     Linton.

                            LINTON (CONT'D)
               I don't like this section. Cut that. I
               don't think this is really what France
               are saying. Let's change that. And these.
               And let's reverse this.

                            BOB ADRIANO
               That's something Karen said.
                            LINTON
               It's not right. Change it.

                            BOB ADRIANO
               Yes sir.

                            LINTON
               And I like this.

                            BOB ADRIANO
               Thank you.

                            LINTON
               Let's say everyone agreed with this.
                            BOB ADRIANO
               Excellent.

               Why's she got control of the blinds? I'm

                                 LINTON
                    What is that, Karen

                                 KAREN
                    I understand you've started up a new
                    committee, what's it called?

                                 LINTON
                    What makes you think that?

                                 KAREN
                    It was mentioned in our London meeting.

                                 LINTON
                    You must have misheard.

                                 KAREN
                    I misheard the word committee?

                                 LINTON
                    Maybe it was another word. Like Khomeini.

                                 KAREN
                    You're sitting on a new Khomeini?

                                 LINTON
                    Possibly. There are a lot of words,
                    Karen. Kansas City. Kitty.
                                  BOB ARIANO
                    Itty.

                                 LINTON
                    Itty is not a word, Bob.

                                  CHAD
                    Commissary?

                                 LINTON
                    Thank you, James

                                  CHAD
                    Chad.

                                 KAREN
                    Ok. Why don't you just recap for me all
                    the committees that you're currently
                    sitting on?

                            LINTON
               I'm Sorry, Karen, you appear to be
               bleeding from your mouth.

     She is. But she doesn't want to leave the meeting.

                            KAREN
               Oh don't try to change the subject
               Linton.

                            LIZA
                      (Looking at Karen)
               Oh no. Holy Mother of....

     Everyone is just looking at her.

                            LINTON
               I don't mean to be rude Karen but that is
               a tad... repulsive. I can't concentrate
               on what you're saying. You have blood
               coming out of your teeth and that's not
               right.

     Karen gets up to go. It's awkward, she's boxed in and has
     to clamber over the others to get to the door.

                            KAREN
               Okay, Liza come with me.

                            CHAD
                      (aside, to Liza)
               Go, Buffy - you belong to the vampire
               queen now.

     Liza follows Karen out. Chad takes Liza's seat.
                            LINTON
               I don't like to see a woman bleeding from
               the mouth. It makes me think of Country
               and Western music. Which I really can't
               abide.

                            CHAD
                      (what?)
               Yes! Ha ha! Exactly.

     Linton sees his chance to take advantage of Karen being
     out of the room.

                            LINTON
               Actually while we're on Any Other
               Business I do have a few points I'd like
               to resolve.

35   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - CORRIDOR/BATHROOM - DAY              35

     They head into the bathroom.

     Liza is pulling handfuls of tissue. Handing them to Karen
     who is dabbing her teeth.

                            KAREN
               Where are at you at with the committees?

                            LIZA
               I got it down to two. The Aims and Policy
               Alignment Committee. Here - put some down
               your front - you don't want it to go down
               your... And the Future Planning
               Committee.

                            KAREN
               Well, it's not the first one. I set that
               one up. Does that really sound dull to
               you? I thought that was a good name.

                            LIZA
               Right, no, it is a good name.

                            KAREN
               Okay, find out if it is definitely the
               Future Planning Committee.

                            LIZA
               Okay. Okay. Right, listen, I might go and
               do that. You're not going to shout at me
               if I go and do that are you?
                            KAREN
               I'm not a fucking monster Liza, okay?
               Will you stop implying I'm some kind of
               monster?


36   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY                                  36

     Liza heads out of the toilets to see Bob Adriano ahead,
     quite a long way.

                              LIZA
               Bob!

     Bob Adriano stops and turns.

                              BOB ADRIANO
               Liza.

     Liza sprints and catches up with him.

                    So listen, Bob, there's something I
                    really want to tell you. We're having a
                    hunk of the month competition, and I just
                    didn't want you to be feel...objectified
                    in any way....and

                                 BOB ADRIANO
                           (hopes it might be a come-
                            on?)
                    Oh really?

                                 LIZA
                    Karen knows about the Future Planning
                    Committee.

     Bob Adriano looks shocked, tries to cover it up.

                                 BOB ADRIANO
                    I have no idea what you're talking about.
     Liza smiles. Runs back into the toilets and gives a
     thumbs up to Karen.

     Simon and Toby walking past the queues at US immigration,
     they are being ushered through a separate channel by
     airport workers and diplomatic staff. As they're escorted
     Simon and Toby catch each other's eye.

                                 TOBY
                    This is cool.
                                 SIMON

                    business.

     A Homeland Security official ushers them through.

                                 SIMON (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    This is a little bit fucking cool.

     But then they reach the end of security and find
     themselves dumped into the same arrivals area as everyone
     else. They walk through.

                                 SIMON
                    There will be a car won't there?

     They walk slowly looking at the various cabbies and
     chauffeurs holding signs.

                                 SIMON
                    Did you book a car?

                    Me? No. I mean, Judy will have got
                    someone to do it.

     He calls on his phone.

                                 TOBY (CONT'D)
                    Hi Judy? Yeah sorry if you're in bed, but
                    we're here and...
                           (looks through papers)
                    Just can't see the car? Wondered what the

     He's looking panicked - then.

                    Here we go.

     accompanied by two police motorcycles.

                           (re : the limo)
                    I almost feel like there should be
                    hookers. Do you know what I mean? Really,
                    here, we should have hookers.

                            out of hand)
                    What? Oh no. God no. No no no no no. I
                    was just - I was just joking. I don't
                    want hookers. I hate hookers. I mean not
                    in an aggressive way. I'm just not
                    interested.

     bad. Pretty fucking good.

     They walk in. Oh. Right. Not so impressive then. Not
     crappy. Just very bland and ordinary.

                                 TOBY
                    It's like a hangar for businessmen.

                    got English....

     SIMON finds two crumbled up one dollar bills and presses
     them into the porter's hand.

                                 TOBY (CONT'D)
                    It's supposed to be a dollar a bag.

     Porter leaves. TOBY goes to window, opens curtain. The

                    Yeah I do. And some of the guys.

                                 KAREN
                    That's why you shouldn't run for Senate.
                    Too many skeletons in your enormous
                    closet.

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    Yeah, don't believe the hype. I'm just
                    thinking about doing ... something. I'm
                    more than just a soldier, Karen.

                                 KAREN
                    That's right, you're passionate about
                    education and housing and what's the
                    other thing?

                                GENERAL MILLER

                    That's right.

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    And bestiality.

                                 KAREN
                    I'd forgotten about that. Are you still
                    allergic to that dog?

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    Yes, yes. I wake up and my eyes are
                    closed and my head is swollen and I look
                    like a giant ball sack.

                                 KAREN
                    Oh my god, they do have memdication for
                    that.....but a beautiful ball sack,
                    though. And how's the pentagon?
                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    It's kicked up a level. Talking invasion
                    real soon.

                                 KAREN
                    Is there somewhere we can talk?

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    I don't know, I don't live in this house.


46   INT. CAULDERWOOD'S PARTY. ADJOINING PLAY ROOM - EVENING          46

     General Miller and Karen are in Caulderwood's kids' play
     room. Toys are piled up everywhere.
                                 KAREN
                    What if someone comes in now?

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    I can't think of an excuse that would
                    work can you?

                                 KAREN
                    No. Just be careful. Don't mess stuff up.

     They sit down on the child's bed. Miller grabs a crayon.

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    Okay so that's total minimum European
                    Theatre requirement.

     He shows her a figure on a piece of paper.

                                 GENERAL MILLER (CONT'D)
                           (he scribbles)
                    This is Far East, Korea, Japan etc.

     He scribbles.

                                 GENERAL MILLER (CONT'D)
                    Add those. Plus contingency already
                    deployed.

                                 KAREN
                    Er - you've lost me.

     Miller looks around, grabs a child's laptop. Opens it, it
     says `howday' in an electronic voice.

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                    Your military hardware is impressive.

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    Not anymore it isn't. Okay so this is
                    total current deployment.
                           (he types)
                    Europe, Asia.
                           (He types)
                    And the contingency already deployed.
                           (He types)
                    So the current number of combat troops
                    available for an invasion according to
                    these figures would be ...
                           (he presses the `equals'
                            button)

                                COMPUTER VOICE
                    Twelve.

                                KAREN
                    Thousand?
                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    No, twelve. Twelve soldiers. Twelve.

                                 KAREN
                    You're shitting me.

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    Of course I'm shitting you, but 12
                    thousand isn't enough. Twelve thousand's
                    about how many are going to die. And you
                    really need a few guys alive at the end
                    of a war or it looks like you've lost.

                                 KAREN
                    Uh-huh. Tomorrow I've got to meet these
                    Brits. Simon Foster. He's the guy that
                    said war was unforseeable, and I think he
                    could very useful on the committee
                    because he could internationalise the
                    dissent.

     Simon knocks on the door. Toby opens, he's in his boxer
     shorts and shirt.

                            SIMON
               Tobes. Hi. So! What's the plan? What
               swanky reception are we going to?

                            TOBY
                      (panic in his eyes)
               What's the plan? For tonight?

                            SIMON
               Well that's what I'm asking you Toby, my
               chief aide, my political advisor.

                            TOBY
               I don't know, I thought tonight we'd be
               tired?

                            SIMON
                      (approaching breaking point
                       with Toby)
               Well I am tired but I'm also a career
               politician Toby, in the political
               powerhouse of the world for forty-eight
               hours. So I thought it might be nice to,
               you know, go out rather than sit in my
               room trying to spank one out watching a
               shark documentary, because I'm scared if
               I watch a porno it'll end up in the
               Register of Members Interests. So what
               have you got?

                            TOBY
               Okay ... What have I got?

                            SIMON
               Don't bullshit me Toby.

                            TOBY
               Okay - so far, we have ... one flyer
               under the door for happy hour in the bar -
               which might be interesting? And I have
               the number of a guy I was with at Uni who
               I believe now works for CNN out here.

                            SIMON
               No.

                    Look, I have to leave. Phone Simon
                    Foster's guy. Tell them to come to the
                    war committee. I'll give them some face
                    time around ten o'clock. It'll be coffee
                    and Danish...tea..they're going to want
                    tea. Tea and sympathy. Tea and a handjob,
                    whatever.

     Toby and Simon are lying on separate beds in their
     underpants watching a shark documentary. Toby is the on
     the phone.

                    There is still a great deal that is

51   INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL BATHROOM - EVENING                       51

     Toby's ending his call with Liza.

                                 TOBY
                    Attending the war committee. That's big.
                    I mean, I have been on a committee
                    before. "Challenges for the cheese
                    market" - that was a big one...
                    but...yes, sure I'd love a drink. Forty
                    minutes? Great.
                           (he does that mobile thing
                            where people sign off by
                            repeatedly saying `bye' with
                            increasing speed but
                            diminishing volume)
                    Bye bye bye-bye-bye-bye-bye bye.

     He hangs up. Very excited. Starts getting ready to see
     Liza. Checks his hair in the mirror. Not quite right. He
     opens a pot of hair gel, takes a scoop and rubs it in his
     hands, ready to put it in his hair. His phone goes again.

     Doesn't know what to do. Doesn't want to pick up the
     phone with gelly hands. No time to wash it off. Grabs a
     towel and picks up the phone holding the towel. He
     struggles to press the answer button. Puts the towel-
     covered phone to his ear.

                                 TOBY (CONT'D)
                    Hello? Hi? Hello?

     He can't hear through the towel. Tries to adjust it.

                                 TOBY (CONT'D)
                    Matty, hi, How's CNN? yes -- sorry? Do I
                    sound muffled?

                    Can't mate. Yeah, Liza Weld's's got us on
                    to Linton's Future Planning Committee in
                    the morning. The war committee, to you
                    and me. So I'm prepping...what? Yes,
                    Future Planning Committee is the war
                    committee. You don't know that? I thought
                    you worked for CNN? Or is that Cartoon

                    Simon, I've managed to get us on the...

     Malcolm is suddenly in his face.

                    You're meant to shit yourself in there.
                    Not out here.

                                TOBY
                    Right.
                           (to Simon)
                    I've got us on to Linton's Future
                    Planning Committee in the morning.

                                 SIMON
                    Okay. What's that?

                                 TOBY
                    It's the war committee.

                                 MALCOLM
                    What? The actual....war committee?

                                 TOBY
                    Yeah, Liza says that...

                                 MALCOLM
                    Who's going to be there?

                                 TOBY
                    Karen Clark, Liza, me and Simon.
                           (off Simon's look)
                    Simon and me.

                                 MALCOLM
                    Who else is going -- Jimmy Osmond?
                    Gwyneth Paltrow? You've been invited to a
                    diversion. The real committee, the real
                    thing, that's happening at The White
                    House.

     Toby picks his jacket up.

                                 TOBY
                    Yeah well, I'll text you the details
                    because I'm going to go out.for A quick
                    drink with some State Department bods.

                                 MALCOLM
                    Don't mention this to the press, ok?
                    Don't mention it to anyone. Because if
                    the press get a whiff there's a war
                    committee, even a cardboard one, every
                    fucker in this town is going to turn up
                    and try and get on it. So no matter what
                    gay bar you end up, keep it schtumm.

     Malcolm flicks the TV over to a news channel.

                                 SIMON
                    I was watching that.

     Malcolm looks at him.

                                 MALCOLM
                    I have to have a word with you. You might
                    want to slip into your negligee.

     Toby heads out.

55   INT. BLACK CAT INDIE CLUB - NIGHT                           55

     Toby and Liza sit in a booth. They are by far the most
     formally dressed people in the club. A band are playing
     angry rock with a vaguely political message. A small knot
     of people are rocking out.

                            LIZA
                      (re : the mosh pit)
               You see those guys? The mosh pit?

                            TOBY
               Yes, I don't think I've ever seen a more
               civilised 'mosh pit' it's more of a mosh
               caucus actually.

                            LIZA
               House staffers, Senators' interns, most
               of them are half-man half-PDF file.
               Tonight they rage hard. Tomorrow they go
               back to the hill and argue noise
               reduction legislation.

     They're chuckling, having a good time.

                            TOBY
                      (beat, looks at her.)
               You're worried.

                       something else entirely)
               It's Pwip Pip.
                            TOBY
               I'm sorry? Pip Pip? Is this... a person
               or a cell phone tarrif or..

                            LIZA
               It's my paper. On the war. Pros and Cons
               of the war. But I came up with too many
               cons. The pro-war guys have started
               calling me `Connie'. So, yes I'm fucking
               worried. My career's on the line.

                             TOBY
               Yeah- I noticed you're worried, cos I saw
               you looking worried. I'm perceptive like
               that. But...
                      (can't think of anything
                       else)
               Don't worry.

                            LIZA
               Okay, this place blows. I'm going. What

                    Well I'm incredibly tired. It feels like
                    my brain's eight hours behind but my
                    liver's 12 hours ahead.

                                 LIZA
                    You don't want to come back to my place
                    for a quick catch up?

     It's an alluring offer.

                                 TOBY
                    However, due to technological
                    developments I no longer need sleep, but
                    am physically rejuvenated by alcohol!

     Toby and Liza are on the bed together, kissing.

                                 TOBY
                    Could I just say, you know, that what
                    happens in Washington stays in
                    Washington?

     Malcolm is     still in Simon's room. He's texting. Simon
     sneaks the     remote and flips from the news back to the
     shark doc.     Malcolm, without looking up, picks up the
     remote and     flicks back to the news.

                                 MALCOLM
                    We are under enormous pressure Simon.
                    Karen will want you to say, `war is
                    unforeseeable'. Linton will want you to
                    talk up `climbing the mountain of
                    conflict'. You say nothing, okay? You
                    can't swing both ways, you're not David
                    fucking Bowie.

                    No, we're going to run that through.

     Toby wakes up. His mouth is parched. He feels terrible.
     He rolls over. Liza is gone. He can't remember where he
     is or what's going on. Then with a flash as he looks at
     the clock - 9.07 he remembers a lot of things in a rush
     and springs out like a Ninja and starts pulling his
     clothes on, while scrabbling for his phone.

     He heads down stairs & out of the apartment.

62   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY                                 62

     Simon and Toby walk out into a larger office. They find a
     couple of seats left out for people waiting and sit down.
     Various staffers come and go, picking up papers and
     files, saying hi, looking knackered, all drinking either
     diet cokes or coffees.
                              TOBY

               Toby -- I don't want to read you the riot
               act here but I am going to have to read
               some extracts from the riot act. Like
               Section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1. Don't
               leave your boss twisting in the wind and
               then burst in late smelling like a pissed
               seaside donkey.

               So I turned up late to the meeting Simon.
               I'm sorry. But it's not like I threw up
               in there.

                    No you're right. I should be thanking you
                    for not throwing up. Well done. You're a
                    star. You didn't wet yourself, you're in
                    the right city, you didn't say anything
                    overtly racist, you didn't pull your dick
                    out and start plucking it and shouting
                    'willy banjo'. No I'm being unfair, you
                    got so much right. Without actually being
                    there for the beginning of one of the
                    biggest meetings of my career. You're a
                    legend.

     An uncomfortable beat.

                                 TOBY
                    That was just - the first bit was it?
                    We're going back in do you ...think?

                                 SIMON
                    We'd barely said hello. I've had muggings
                    that have lasted longer than that. We
                    really only spoke about flammable cheese.

     Liza comes out, passes by. Toby mouths `shit' to himself.

                           (looking at a list on her
                            desk, then to a staffer)
                    Are these all requests to get on the
                    committee? What's going on? Did someone
                    post an invite on Facebook? I'm drowning
                    in Senators. It's Senator soup here.

                                 TOBY
                    Hi Liza.

                    Hey Toby.

     Toby gets up for a private word.

                           (re last night)

                    Yes, I'm feeling fine. Why were you late?

                                 TOBY
                    Because...you know...you didn't wake me
                    up.

               You looked so sweet. I thought you knew
               what you were doing.

                            TOBY
               I was asleep, of course I didn't. That's
               how people walk out of windows.

               Hey Liza, I've got another call about the
               Committee from Senator Crudden's office,
               he wants in too.

                            LIZA
               What is going on here? Fuck. Why's this
               my problem? Toby you sure you didn't do
               bad? You didn't mention the committee to
               anyone else?
                            TOBY
               Nada. Nada.. Bad-da. Nada-bada bing-bong
               ding-dang-dong.
                      (beat, she looks at him)
               I have no idea what I'm saying anymore I
               think I really am still quite drunk.

     Chad is passing. As Liza turns away Toby's face does a
     spasm of regret at his brazen lying.

                            CHAD
               Everyone is so hot for your paper. I'm
               running off another ten copies. It's
               spreading like a virus, Liza. You're in
               hot water. You're lobsterising.

                            LIZA
               I don't feel that.

                            CHAD
               It's by degrees. Wafting. Bisque.
               I smell lobster. Can you smell lobster,
               Toby?

     Simon calls Toby back over.

                               SIMON (O.S.)
               Mate!

                               TOBY

63   INT. WHITE HOUSE. SMALLISH ROOM - DAY                       63

     Malcolm is arriving into a meeting room set up with water
     etc with a young man who looks like an intern, A.J.

                            A.J.
               How are you today? Beat the traffic?

     Malcolm looking around, as if things aren't right.

                            MALCOLM
               Yeah yeah. Hunky dory. Can I get a
               coffee?
     He gives AJ his coat.

                            A.J.
                      (doesn't take coat then
                       eventually does and just
                       puts it on a chair, not the
                       coat stand)
               Sure, sure, if we get started, I'll get
               my assistant to bring us some
               refreshments.

                            MALCOLM
                      (realising)
               Your assistant?
                            A.J.
                      (sitting, picking up a file
                       in the room)
               Yeah. So, Item. We need to have a
               conversation about the mood of the
               British Parliament. Any bumps in the road
               ahead.

                            MALCOLM
               I'm sorry son, am I - is this it? No
               offence, but shouldn't you be at school
               with your head down a toilet?

                            A.J.
               Your first point there, the offence. I'm
               afraid I'm gonna have to take it. Your
               second point. I'm 22. But - item - It's
               my birthday in nine days, so if it would
               be more comfortable we could... wait...?

                    Don't get sarcastic with me son.
                           (starts dialling)
                    We burnt this tight-arsed city to the
                    ground in 1814 and I'm all for doing it
                    again. Starting with you, you frat fuck.
                    You get sarcastic with me again and I
                    will stuff so much cotton wool dowm your
                    fucking throat it'll come out of your
                    arse like the wee tail on a playboy
                    bunny. Okay? I thought...I was led to
                    believe I was attending the war
                    committee.

                                 A.J.
                    Yes, Assistant Secretary of State Linton
                    Barwick wanted me to brief you on the
                    work of the Future Planning Committee.

                                 MALCOLM
                    I don't want the bullshit son, I want the
                    bull. No one sidelines me. I'm away.

     Malcolm gets up, grabs his coat. An even younger guy
     wheels in a coffee trolley.

                                 MALCOLM (CONT'D)

                    President has also graced us with his
                    presence!

     Karen goes into the toilet. Simon and Toby head off
     looking sheepish.

     As they head out of the vestibule. There is a gaggle of

     Linton is with Adriano, quietly horrified by all these
     people. General Miller passes them.

                           (For Miller's benefit)
                    We seem to be overrun with insurgents
                    here, Bob.

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    Hi, I'm in seat 204, row W. Will I be
                    able to see the big screen from there?
                    Oh, and can I get one of those big pointy
                    foam hands with `Go, Monster Trucks!'
                    written on it?

                                 LINTON
                    The general is on rare form, very rare
                    form.

     Toby spots his hero.

     But the room is rapidly filling with bodies and din. More
     and more people are turning up. Toby's view of Miller is
     obscured.

                                 TOBY
                    That's the second time in 24 hours I've
                    had a partially obscured view of him.


67   INT. SMALL COMMITTEE ROOM. DAY.                                 67

     Linton calls the over-stuffed, standing-room-only room to
     order.

                                 LINTON
                    Okay, due to the fact that seemingly
                    everyone in the world who owns a suit has
                    turned up for this meeting, we'll be
                    relocating to a bigger room. Room 720.
                    So, if you will be so kind...
     The committee members file out.


68   EXT. WASHINGTON STREET NR STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY                68

     Malcolm is legging it down the street.


69   INT. LARGER COMMITTEE ROOM 720 - DAY                            69

     The committee members file in.

     Miller goes close up to Linton.
                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    Just so you know -- Karen and I did not
                    appreciate having to sneak around like
                    Mulder and Scully trying to find out
                    about this committee.

                                 LINTON
                    Well, you're both here now. John and
                    Yoko.

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    You and I need to talk, mano-a-mano,
                    cocks on the block, about how things are
                    operating around here at the moment.

     Linton not fazed by this.

                                 LINTON
                    Sure. How about 12:30 tomorrow, my
                    office?

                                GENERAL MILLER
                    Good.

     General Miller takes his seat. Linton turns on Adriano.

                                 LINTON
                    What the hell happened?

                                 ADRIANO
                    I have no idea how they all heard sir.
                    There must have been a leak.

     General Miller is sitting next to Karen. They're watching
     Linton having angry words with Adriano.

                                 GENERAL MILLER
                    Look at Adriano. Poor fuck. He looks like
                    he's with his Daddy: "Sorry, Bob, you're
                    adopted. From a couple with hereditary
                    heart defects."
                                 KAREN
                    "And your mother only ever kept your baby
                    clothes for the purposes of voodoo."

     Simon is sitting with Toby, marvelling at the numbers of
     people cramming into the room.

                                 SIMON
                    I'm room meat again. This is a massive
                    abattoir of room meat. Stay outside
                    Tobes, I need a guy on the outside. Make
                    friends with Chad, that boy from The
                    Shining. He knows stuff. Pump him.
                                 TOBY
                    Oh no. I want to stay in here with
                    Miller. Don't make me pump Chad.

                                 SIMON
                    I'm making you pump Chad. Go on.

     Toby gets up to leave.

                                 SIMON (CONT'D)
                    It'll be easy peasy lemon squeezy.

                                 TOBY
                    No it won't. It'll be difficult difficult
                    lemon difficult.

     Toby reluctantly leaves, trying to grab another peek at
     Miller.

     Malcolm running like a madman.


71   INT. LARGER COMMITTEE ROOM 720 - DAY                         71

     Everyone is finally assembled. The room has thirty or so
     people in it.

                            LINTON
               So, welcome to this, somewhat engorged
               session of the Future Planning Committee.
               You can all see an agenda?

     People are looking at their agendas, low-level chatter,
     pouring of water, etc. - a general pre-meeting feel.

                            KAREN
               Assistant Secretary -- here on point 6,
               it feels like there's an assumption that
               we'll be invading. Should we talk about
               the practical? I mean this is the war
               committee after all?

                            LINTON
               It's the Future Planning Committee.

                            KAREN
               Unofficially it's known as the war
               committee.

                            LINTON
               Well, unofficially we can call anything
               whatever we like.
                      (he holds up a water glass)
               Unofficially, this is a shoe. But it's
               not a shoe, Karen, it's a glass of water,
               and this is the Future Planning
               Committee.


72   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT. 7TH FLOOR - DAY                       72

     Malcolm is running down the corridor. He runs into Room
     712. It's empty.

                            MALCOLM
               Bitch!


73   INT. BIG COMMITTEE ROOM. DAY.                                73

     Karen is talking.

                                 KAREN
                    But what I'm asking is has a decision
                    been reached in principle to advocate
                    invasion?

                                 LINTON
                    That's way off agenda Karen. Although it
                    would seem a general consensus may be
                    forming.

                                 KAREN
                    What makes you say that?

                                 LINTON
                    Well I noted with interest the recent
                    comments of our colleague Simon Foster in
                    that regard.

     Simon is texting under the desk and not really paying
     full attention. He hears his name, looks up, waves to the
     group. He doesn't clock Karen's intense look that says
     `You are going to rebut that, aren't you?'

                                 KAREN
                    Perhaps Mr. Foster would have something
                    to say about that?

                                 SIMON
                           (politely)
                    I'm just...watching with interest. IN
                    Britain we have a saying for complicated
                    situations such as this, which is that
                    it's
                           (he can't believe he's going
                            to say this)
                    `Difficult, difficult, lemon, difficult.'

     He goes back to his text.

                                 LINTON
                    As I say it seems a consensus is forming.

                                 KAREN
                           (furious)
                    That's just ridiculous. You have no basis
                    for saying that.

                                 LINTON
                    Karen, please, calm down. We don't want
                    you to have another hemorrhage. Item One.

     It's lunchtime. Lots of staffers have left their desks. A
     few are eating sandwiches at their desks, or reading a
     newspaper during lunch. Chad is emailing, reading, multi-
     tasking, from a corner of desk near Linton's office.

                            TOBY
               So - do you want to go out and get some
               lunch?

                            CHAD
               Are you kidding? Lunchtime is work time.

                            TOBY
               Yes, what an incredibly depressing motto.
               You see you're playing into the hands of
               the French saying that.
     Toby mooches around, peers in Linton's office. He spots a
     couple of A4 sheets of paper that have been printed out
     with `Climb the mountain of conflict!' across them as an
     encouraging slogan on the wall.

                              TOBY (CONT'D)
                        (looking in)
               Jesus.

                            CHAD
               Yeah work hours are too valuable - for
               networking. You gotta get in at like 6
               work till 8.30 Then start making those
               connections baby.
                      (he clicks his fingers
                       rapidly, annoyingly)
               Emails and admin at lunch. See if you can
               play some strategic racquetball through
               the pm. Then in the six till midnight
               slot chow down on some serious policy
               work.

                            TOBY
               Right. And what - friends, family,
               novels, sexual inter-course you're going
               to save those for your thirties and
               forties?


75   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT. CORRIDOR/BATHROOM - DAY              75

     Malcolm arrives at the committee just as people are
     spilling out. He's pissed off. Follows Linton into
     bathroom.

                            MALCOLM
               Are you fucking me about?

                                 LINTON
                    Mr Tucker, isn't it? Hello again.

                                 MALCOLM
                    You might pull this kind of stunt on some
                    young wank fresh up from Oklahoma, happy
                    to be getting his hookers paid for by
                    tobacco lobbyists, but not me.

                                 LINTON
                    What seems to be the problem?

                                 MALCOLM
                    I've just had a briefing from a 9-year-
                    old finalist in Americas got talent. I
                    think he may have been a ventriloquist.
                    Or possibly the fucking dummie.

                                 LINTON
                    AJ? He is one of my top guys. Stanton
                    College Prep, Harvard...he's smart and
                    he's great at his job.

                                 MALCOLM
                    His fucking briefing notes were written
                    in Alphabetti Spaghetti. When I left I
                    nearly tripped over his umbilical cord.

                                 LINTON
                    I'm sorry if it troubles you that our
                    people achieve excellence at a young age.

     Simon is emerging. Linton takes Malcolm to one side, out
     of Simon's earshot.
                                 LINTON (CONT'D)
                    By the way, your prime minister informs
                    me that he's tasked you with collating
                    some fresh British intel for us.

                                 MALCOLM
                    Yeah, apparently your fucking master race
                    of gifted toddlers can't quit get the job
                    done in between breast feeds and playing
                    with their power rangers. So yeah, we're
                    getting some actual grown-ups to bail you
                    out.

     Simon gets closer. Linton moves in.

                                 LINTON
                           (to Simon)
                    Minister, thank you so much for your
                    support and your recent "Climb the
                    mountain of conflict" comment - great.
                    We're going to run with that, it has
                    great repeatability.

               Thanks very much, but...it's all a bit
               complex really, in terms of my...

     Linton pulls away, starts walking off.

                            LINTON
               It's early days, my friend. All roads
               lead to Munich.

     He smiles and walks off.

                            MALCOLM
               What the fuck does that mean? `All roads
               lead to Munich'?

                            SIMON
               Well it just means...I guess, I don't
               know what it means.
                            MALCOLM
               `All roads lead to Munich'?

     Malcolm is pissed off, looks around. He is not the centre
     of attention. He's feeling cut out.

                            MALCOLM (CONT'D)
               Come on let's go, get back to the hotel,
               nick as many coat hangers as you can.
               We're off back to London.


76   EXT. WASHINGTON STREET                                      76

     Malcolm, Toby, and Simon are heading towards their car.
     They see the Washington Monument in the distance.

                            SIMON
               It's beautiful.

                            TOBY
               If you pull it out, America deflates.

               Oh no. Should we send Mark a card?

                            MALCOLM
               Nah, I'll send him a ouija board so they
               can keep in touch.

                                 SIMON
                    So what are we getting back to? Apart
                    from a nice cup of tea and some knife
                    crime?

                                 SIMON
                    Great, meeting my constituents. It's like
                    being Simon Cowell, but without the
                    ability to say, `Fuck off, you're
                    mental.'


77   INT. CONSTITUENCY OFFICE. DAY.                                   77

     TOBY and SIMON are with Simon's constituency agent, ROZ,
     she's ushering them into the small, damp little
     constituency office. ROZ's arm is in a sling (Jo
     Scanlon's arm actually is in a sling) and she has
     difficulty opening the door

                                 ROZ
                           (to Simon)
                    Sorry, could you...? You just need to
                    kick the bottom quite hard.

     Simon kicks the bottom of the door to unstick it.

     Roz opens the door. There are a few constituents waiting
     to see Simon, he nods a hello.

                                 SIMON
                           (Roz has gone ahead, this is
                            to Toby)
                    Look at them. They all have that
                    smell....like a charity shop, you know?
                           (to constituents)
                    Afternoon!

     A couple of the waiting constituents respond. They go
     through to another little office.

                                 ROZ
                    Right, here you go, you're pretty booked
                    up - there's a list on the desk. I'm just
                    going to have a look at the guttering.

                                 SIMON
                    I'm just back from America, so it was
                    pretty tough to make it up here - but you
                    know. That's me.

                                 ROZ
                    Of course. Right. How was the
                    President?

     General Miller & Aides up stairs


79   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - DAY                                    79

     General Miller (and an aide or two?) marches into Linton
     and Karen's section of State. He's got a meeting
     scheduled. He's a man on a mission.

     He marches straight past Bob Adriano ...

                                 MILLER
                           (by way of explanation)
                    Twelve-thirty.

                                 BOB ADRIANO
                    Um, hold on General ...

     And into Linton's office.

     But - it's empty.
                                 MILLER
                    What the fuck?

                                 BOB ADRIANO
                    Yeah, Secretary Linton Barwick wanted me
                    to let you know his last - meeting looks
                    like it's over-running. He sends
                    apologies.

     Miller stands there for a beat. Very very annoyed.

                                 MILLER
                    He stood me up? They're better be a
                    fucking good reason. Like he's dead. That
                    is just plain fucking rude. I mean, how
                    would he like it if I just did a big
                    hairy shit on his desk?

                                 BOB ADRIANO
                    You're very w-welcome to wait, we have
                    newspapers and periodicals?

     He gestures to a seating area. Miller picks up a
     magazine. Rolls it up, looks at Bob Adriano. Might
     Miller, possibly, hit him?

                                 MILLER
                    Yeah well excuse me if at this time of
                    national crisis I don't sit with a thumb
                    up my ass flipping through Time magazine
                    eating pop tarts?
                           (he heads off fast - not
                            quite sure where he's going,
                            calls back as he goes)
                    Tell him to call me. But he might not get
                    through cos I'm a fucking busy man.

     He finds himself heading into Karen's office.

     It's empty. He stands there for a beat. Shuts the door.

     Looks around. Picks up a hole punch. Kicks the couch.
     Karen enters, surprised to find him there.

                                 KAREN
                    Hey, what is it?

                                 MILLER
                    Yeah - can I hang around in here for a
                    while?

                                 KAREN
                    Er. Sure. Why?

                                 MILLER
                    Do I need a fucking reason?
                           (beat, calming down)
                    Linton's playing me like a fucking turkey
                    drumstick on a big bass drum.

                                 KAREN
                    Look, I was going to order food, do you
                    want to eat.

                                 MILLER
                    Yeah. Order us some cute mammals. Alive.
                    A lamb or a piglet so I can snap it's
                    fucking neck.

     Simon listens behind a desk. Roz is there taking notes.

     Toby is in the corner working on a laptop.

                    My point is - if the septic tank - if we
                    didn't know it was there in the first
                    place how can we be responsible for it
                    now?

                    Yes. No. I understand.

                                 MRS MCDAIRMID
                    It's under the communal drive. Why should
                    we get it pumped?

                    Well it's not a council sceptic tank so
                    they're not legally obliged to pump it...

                                 MRS MCDAIRMID
                    Look, according to the paperwork there's
                    four metric tons of of shit under there.
                    That's not all me, is it? I'm not a

                    No, of course not. Nor should you be
                    treated like one. Okay, Mrs McDairmid.
                    Leave it with me. I'm sure there must be
                    a way through this. Alright?

     Mrs Kendrick heads out.

               You won't be able to forget me because

               See, this is the problem with civilians
               wanting to go to war. When you've been
               there you don't want to go back unless
               you absolutely have to. It's like France.

                    I want that, that, that, that and that.

                    Exactly. I'm too senior. I can't leak.
                    Leaking is for people like your Liza and

                    No, sure, but could she use a hose, from
                    a distance?

                                 PAUL MICHAELSON
                    She doesn't have a hose, she's got a
                    watering can. This is like talking to a
                    brick wall about a brick wall.
                           (to journalist)
                    Get that down, that's gold.

     Toby can still see Malcolm going ballistic at Simon and
     Judy in Simon's office.

87   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                       87

     Karen runs out of the lifts. There's even more of a buzz
     than usual, people running around. She sees Bob Adriano,
     Linton and Chad in a huddle in Linton's air. Hurries over
     to Liza.

                             KAREN
                Liza, what's up? Why is everyone running
                around? This better be a fucking fire
                drill.

                             LIZA
                The President has said he's vetoing
                tarrifs on Chinese auto imports.

                             KAREN
                Shit.
     Karen calls over to a staffer, ABBEY.

                             KAREN (CONT'D)
                Abbey, get me the president's statement.

                             ABBEY
                Mr Barwick has asked me to...

     Karen is   beginning to lose it.

                             KAREN
                You work to me, Abbey, you fucking work
                to me. Get me the statement. Or I will
                call security and have you escorted off
                the premises via the window.
     Karen crosses quickly to her office. Liza follows.

                             LIZA
                Sorry, why is that...? He's...what,
                buttering the Chinese up?

                             KAREN
                He needs them to at least abstain in the
                security council.

     A beat.

                             LIZA
                We're going to the UN.

                             KAREN
                Yes, we're going to the UN.

                             LIZA
                Shit.

     Karen kicks a waste-paper basket.

                                 KAREN
                    I should be told this fucking stuff!
                    I'm going into Linton's office and
                    pulling the pin on his grenade.

                                 LIZA
                    Don't do that.

                                 KAREN
                    I'm fucking joking.

                                  LIZA
                    Oh.

                                 KAREN
                    Why didn't you know about this?

                                 LIZA
                    Well since I created the budget deficit
                    the President doesn't tend to run things
                    by me anymore.

                                 KAREN
                    Don't get funny with me. I am not in the
                    mood.

                                 LIZA
                    No. I'm getting that.


88   INT. MALCOLM'S OFFICE - DAY                                      88

     Malcolm is with Simon and Toby. Malcolm has a local
     Northamptonshire paper.

                                 MALCOLM

                    doesn't give a shit.

                                 SIMON
                    It doesn't say that.

                           (holding up paper)
                    No but it says `Wall-ace and Gromitt'

                                 MALCOLM
                    You are being portrayed as the biggest
                    twat in Northamptonshire, and that's
                    going some.

                                 TOBY
                    It is just a wall, Malcolm.

                                 MALCOLM
                    Listen, my little stem cell, I don't want
                    to be dealing with this either, okay?
                    I've got bigger fucking fish to fry,
                    believe me. I'm rolling blue whales in
                    breadcrumbs at the moment. I'm giving
                    this to Jamie.

                                 SIMON
                    Oh great. The crossest man in Scotland.

     Jamie enters, holding another local rag.
                                 JAMIE
                    Well, if it isn't Humpty-Numpty...

                                 SIMON
                    What is this, surround bollocking?

                                 JAMIE
                    With respect, I haven't finished. If it
                    isn't Humpty-Numpty, sitting on top of a
                    collapsing wall like some clueless egg-
                    cunt.

                                SIMON
                    Hi Jamie.
                                TOBY
                    Hello.

                    Okay, that's enough of the fucking

                    the planet, okay?

     Simon, Toby and Jamie look at him.

               Don't look at me like that's arrogant.
               That is just a fucking fact. Don't even
               look at me.
                      (to Jamie)
               Be gentle with them.

                            JAMIE
               You know me, Malcy, kid gloves.   Made
               from real kids.

     Malcolm leaves.

     An awkward beat.

                            JAMIE (CONT'D)
               Right, Butch and Gaydance, this wall
               story is playing badly.
                      (looking in his paper)
               Look, here's a cartoon of you as a
               walrus.

                            SIMON
               A walrus? I'm not fat. I don't even have
               a moustache.

                            TOBY
               Look...we hired some builders. They
               didn't turn up when they said they would.

                            JAMIE
               They're builders. What did you expect?!
               Have you ever seen a film where the hero
               is a builder? No. Because they never turn
               up in the fucking nick of time.That's why
               you never see a superhero with a hod.

     Simon and Judy on their way into the foreign office.
     Malcolm has gone in ahead. Suzy chatting on the stairs
     with Toby.

     Simon draws Judy to one side.

                            SIMON
               This is all getting...this is a really
               stressful job, you know that?

                            JUDY
               Oh come on, you're not a brain surgeon,
               you're not a snooker player ...

                    Oh. Right.

                                 SIMON
                    Look, drop some hints, put some nods and
                    winks out there, that I'm toying with
                    resignation. Yeah? See if the PM reacts.
                    See how it plays.

                                 JUDY
                    Put out some winks?

                                SIMON
                    And nods.

                                JUDY
                    Big nods?

                           (he does a small nod)
                    That sort of size nod.

     Judy nods.

                                 SIMON (CONT'D)
                    No, not that much.

                                 JUDY
                    No, I was just nodding normally to say I
                    understood the need for a small nod.
                                SIMON

90   INT. FOREIGN OFFICE - DAY                                        90

     In a nice room. Malcolm is with Michael, Suzy and a
     couple of other civil servants.

                                 MALCOLM
                    So, my lovely friends, bottom line...

                                 MICHAEL
                    I hate that phrase. We're not in

                                 MALCOLM
                    Sorry Michael, I promise never to use it

                    Bottom line, is that the President is
                    going to the UN, and the PM would like us
                    to join him. This will be the voe to
                    commence military action. So, Rob, Innis,
                           (to Toby)
                    Little Bo Cock Jockey
                           (to Judy)
                    And the leaky fucking mingebox, return to
                    your desks and prepare for some extreme
                    briefing.

     Two CIVIL SERVANTS get up and exit. Judy walks across the
     room and starts making calls, as does Toby. Michael walks
     off into the next room, Suzy follows. They start calling.

                                 MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                    Now then, you still got doubts,
                    Complicated Simon?

                                 SIMON
                    What the fuck, Malcolm. This is all going
                    to spin along from here and we have a
                    vote and we go to war. We fight people,
                    and kill them, and our kids get killed,
                    and that's exactly the sort of thing I
                    didn't want to do when I went into
                    politics. That's the opposite of what I
                    want to be doing.

                                 MALCOLM
                    That's why you've got to stay in
                    Government. In here you can influence
                    things, delay things. Out there you're
                    just another mad shouty fucker people
                    don't want to make eye-contact with.
                    Remember Mary? She took a stand over
                    Health. Everyone decided she was mental.

                                 SIMON
                    Only because the Sun showed a photo of
                    her with wide eyes and her head on a cow.

                                 MALCOLM
                    I found that a very powerful image.
                           (a beat)
                    Look, the Prime Minister of this country

                    he doesn't go round biting tramps. He
                    doesn't go to Chequers at the weekend for
                    a bit of light raping and a pub lunch.

     Then nods a slight nod again.


91   INT. WESTMINSTER PUB - DAY                                  91

     Suzy, Michael and Judy are having a drink in a pub. Maybe
     they're sitting in a four seater booth?

     Their phones are on the table. As is a bottle of
     Sancerre. Judy's got her power walking trainers on and
     her rucksack with her.

                                 MICHAEL
                    Cheers everyone. Here's to surviving
                    another day.

     They clink glasses.

                                 JUDY
                    My theory is Malcolm built Jamie in a lab
                    out of bits of old psychopath.

     Toby arrives, dumps his coat, bag, puts his phone on the
     table.

                                 TOBY
                    Hello ladies.

                                 SUZY
                    And gentleman.

                           (doing the joke again)
                    Hello ladies. I'm just going to -

                                 MICHAEL
                    Oh. Lovely. I think we could have another
                    bottle of Sancerre.

                                TOBY
                    Great.

                                 SUZY
                    If you can afford it.
                                 JUDY
                    If you can get served at the bar.

     He goes to the bar. His phone gets a text. Suzy picks it
     up, reads it.

                                 SUZY
                    Fucking hell. Here we go again. Fucking

                           (peering at the phone)
                    Woah!

     Suzy shows the phone to Judy.

                                  JUDY
                    What a twat.

     Suzy's texting on Toby's mobile. Toby's coming back. Suzy
     puts the phone back down.

                            TOBY
               Yeah I wouldn't want to meet Jamie in a
               dark alley. Or a bright alley. The whole
               thing of just being in an alley with him
               would be scary, regardless of the
               lighting.

     Suzy cuts in.

                            SUZY
               You've got a text.

                            TOBY
                      (reading, covering)
               Oh yeah. It's just Rob about football.

                            SUZY
               So, Liza. You shagged her?

                              TOBY
               What? No.

                            SUZY
                      (to Judy)
               Did you know my flakey boyfriend has been
               getting his flakey end away?

                            JUDY
               I don't know anything about his flakey
               end.

                            TOBY
               Could we not talk about accusations and,
               health issues, in the pub?

                              JUDY
               I should go.

                            SUZY
               You haven't finished your drink.

                            JUDY
               No. I mainly have.

                            SUZY
               Why did you do it?

                            TOBY
               I don't know, it was a weird, intense
               time over there. It was...maybe,
               subconsciously, I don't know, it was a
               kind of last ditch attempt to stop this,
               awful...war.

                            MICHAEL
               That's classic. That's definitely going
               in the memoirs.

                            SUZY
               You had sex because of the war?

                            TOBY
               In the broad sense.
                      (to Judy and Michael)
               Sorry, can you stop doing that? Can we go
               somewhere where they're aren't enormous
               children eating snacks?

                              JUDY
               I should go.

                            SUZY
               Actually I'll go.

     She goes. Toby goes after her.

                            MICHAEL
                      (a beat)
               Shall we stay?

                            JUDY
               I should go. I've got a long walk ahead
               of me. But that'll keep me going.

     Toby lets himself into the flat. Goes through to the
     kitchen. Suzy is there with Michael.

                            TOBY
               What the fuck is he doing here?

                      (to Michael)
               I'll go make that tea.

     They go back out into the living room.

93   INT. TOBY'S FLAT - LATER                                         93

     Toby is in the bedroom. A few boxes are lying around.
     He's putting clothes into bin liners. Suzy is hovering.
     Michael brings through some teas. The atmosphere is very
     frosty and awkward.

                                 TOBY
                    Where's my needlecord jacket?

                                 SUZY
                    Your geography teacher's jacket?

     Toby thinks better of responding. Starts folding some
     shirts. Michael takes over

                                 MICHAEL
                    That's not how you fold.
                                 TOBY
                    Michael, this is one of the more
                    humiliating moments of my life. I can
                    pack a bag.

                                 MICHAEL
                    The key to travelling is packing.

                                 TOBY
                    I'm not going to fucking Fiji Michael,
                    I'm being chucked out of my house.

                                 MICHAEL
                    It'll save time the other end.

                                 TOBY
                    There is no other end.

     Toby moves through to the kitchen to get his jeans. Suzy
     and Michael follow.

                    Has she got big tits?

                                 TOBY
                    Massive. Enormous. You can see them on
                    Google Earth. They've got their own
                    postcode.

     Toby gets his jeans and some other clothes. He's laden
     down with boxes and bags and can hardly see. Comes out
     into the hall. Suzy is there without Michael.

                                 TOBY (CONT'D)
                    See you then.

                                SUZY
                    Okay.

     Toby struggles to open the front door. Suzy opens it.
     Toby goes to leave then stops.

                                 TOBY
                    Look, Suzy, this is probably going to
                    sound odd under the circumstances.

                                SUZY
                    Quickie?

                                 TOBY
                    No. Thank you. But no. It's about Liza.

                                 SUZY
                    Oh good tell me more, tell me more about
                    her tits.
                                 TOBY
                    Listen, Suze, Liza wrote a paper, Pwip-
                    Pip. I think, if it got leaked, it could
                    stop the war.

     He holds out the memory stick.

                                 MICHAEL
                    Good tactic. Get earnest. I tried that
                    with the wife. Didn't work.

                                 SUZY
                    You are such a fucking coward, you know

     Toby leaves the memory stick in the flat. Then heads out.


94   INT. CAR - DAY                                               94

     Simon, Toby and Judy are on the way to Heathrow.

                            SIMON
               Should I resign? I've floated that I
               might, when I thought I wouldn't, so
               it'll look convincing if I did. I mean,
               do you think, is it braver to just resign
               and say, `No, no war'?
                            JUDY
               Yes.

                            SIMON
               Or is it actually braver to say, `I don't
               agree, but I'm going to grit my teeth and
               get on with it?' Is the really brave
               thing actually doing what you don't
               believe?

                            JUDY
               No.

                            TOBY
               Though -- maybe? What's brave about doing
               the `right thing'? Nothing. Doing the
               wrong thing is braver. In a way. I mean,
               you know, wars sometimes work. The War of
               Independence, that worked. For the
               Americans. Second World War. That was a
               good idea. I mean not a good idea but ...

                            SIMON
               I know what you mean. And the Crimean War
               -- we got nurses out of that.

                            TOBY
               Nurses are good.

                            SIMON
                      (as if they've achieved
                       something)
               Exactly. So...right. Exactly.

                            JUDY
               So you're not resigning?

                    No, I..(trying to change the subject)
                    where's Malcolm?


95   INT. AIRPORT ARRIVALS - DAY                                      95

     Judy, Simon and Toby are walking past a baggage carousel.

                                 SIMON
                           (conspiratorially to Toby)
                    In the motorcade. Let's get a car without
                    Judy.

                                 TOBY
                    You want hookers? You like hooky fucky?

                                 SIMON
                    I want to talk about the resigning thing.
                                TOBY
                    Still?

                                 SIMON
                    But with you and not her. She has this
                    air of moral righteousness that inhibits
                    you from... saying anything morally
                    wrong.


96   INT. LIMO - DAY                                                  96

     Simon and Toby looking very uptight. Malcolm's with them.

                                 MALCOLM
                           (looking at phone)
                    So. The wires are all currently reporting
                    that you're going to resign from
                    government over the war.

                                 SIMON
                    What? That wasn't supposed to get
                    outside.

                                 MALCOLM
                    Yeah well it is outside. It's lurking
                    outside like a big hairy rapist at a
                    coach station.

     Simon looks to Toby for help.

                                 MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                    Do you know, if I could I'd punch you
                    into total paralysis.

     Malcolm, Simon, Toby and Judy are being led through a
     bleak, soulless basement corridor in the UN by Sir
     Jonathan Tutt, the British ambassador to the UN.

                            SIR JONATHAN
               Hello, gentlemen, Sir Jonathan Tutt. This
               is it. The United Nations.

                            SIMON
               It's all a bit `blurrrgh', isn't it?

                            JUDY
               It could do with a few more scatter
               cushions and a bit less asbestos.

                            SIR JONATHAN
               I don't know what you were expecting --
               Jacobean panelling perhaps, arabesques of
               stonework tracery... great fountains...

                            MALCOLM
               It's a shithole. It looks like a hospice
               for robots.

     They pass a big office.

                            SIR JONATHAN
               Linton Barwick is in there. Karen Clark
               is there. You're right here.

     Sir Jonathan shows them to their office.
                            SIR JONATHAN (CONT'D)
               If you need anything, just whistle. You
               know how to whistle don't you Malcolm?
               You just put your lips together and blow.

     Malcolm and Toby look at one another.

                            SIR JONATHAN (CONT'D)
               Right. I'm off upstairs to the informal
               delegates' reception. Hope there's
               nibbles, I'm ravenous.

     Sir Jonathan leaves.

                            MALCOLM
               Nibbles? Who still says nibbles?

                            TOBY
               Fuck the nibbles, what was with the
               homoerotic tension?

     Malcolm gets a call.

                     Jamie. Hello?

      He looks at his phone.

                                  MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                     No fucking signal down here. Jesus.
                     I'd be better off in an internet cafe in
                     Kircoddy.

      He leaves the room.


98    INT. NUMBER 10 - SAME TIME                                      98

      Jamie is on the phone, running down a corridor.

                                  JAMIE
                     Okay, your phone's off, which means
                     you've been shot dead by a fat American,
                     but there's been a fucktastrophe.
                     Someone's leaked Liza Weld's Pwip Pip
                     paper to the BBC. I reckon it'll be on
                     the Six O'Clock news here, one o'clock
                     your time, so it's going to fist your
                     fucking vote apart. Missing you loads,
                     pwip-pip, toodle-oo!


99    EXT. UN BUILDING - DAY                                          99

      Malcolm finishing listening to his voicemail, dialling
      and running back into the building, pushing past a crowd
      of smokers at the doorway.
                                  MALCOLM
                     Okay Jamie, two jobs. One: find the Pwip
                     Pip leaker and kill them. That's one job.
                     Job one has two parts. Job two: stop Pwip
                     Pip coming out. Sow enough seeds of fear
                     and doubt that the fat arses at the BBC
                     dither till after the vote, okay? After
                     the vote Enola Gay is cleared for take-
                     off and everything is groovy.   I love
                     you.


100   INT. UN FUNCTION ROOM/BAR - CONTINUOUS                         100

      Lots of delegates drinking and eating and chatting. We
      glimpse Linton, Karen, General Miller. Sir Jonathan is
      there, mingling.

      Malcolm approaches Simon, Toby, Judy and Sir Jonathan.

                     Do not move from this spot or I'll
                     fucking stab you.

                                   SIR JONATHAN
                     Hm?

                            (to Simon)
                     Was it you?

                                  SIMON
                     No, what? No.

                                  MALCOLM
                     But you know what I'm talking about?

                                  SIMON
                     No, but whatever it was I didn't do it.
                                  MALCOLM
                            (to Toby)
                     Was it you, The-Baby-From-Eraserhead?

                                   TOBY
                     No.

                                  MALCOLM
                            (to Judy)
                     So it must have been you Woman from The
                     Crying Game?

                                  JUDY
                     It wasn't me. You've really got it in for
                     me haven't you?

                                  MALCOLM
                     Someone's dropped a bollock in the
                     noodles and I reckon it was you.

                                  JUDY
                     We've done this all before. You accused
                     me of leaking last time and it wasn't me.

                                  MALCOLM
                     Yeah well I know you didn't leak last
                     time. But what I reckon is you got so
                     pissy about being accused, you leaked
                     this time.

                                  TOBY
                     Yeah. Yeah, that does sound possible.

                                  JUDY
                     Look Springer Spaniel, keep your little
                     wet nose out alright?

                             TOBY
                I'm just saying psychologically speaking
                that sounds plausible - that you might
                build up a resentment and then pay it off
                in some underhand way. That's just
                something I've observed.

      Malcolm's had enough goes over and grabs Sir Jonathan,
      mid-conversation, and manhandles him away.

                             MALCOLM
                Come on, Baldermort, I need a word.

      Meanwhile Judy and Toby are left alone - Toby embarrassed
      about his comments.

                             TOBY
                       (they look at each other)
                Sorry about that - it's just ...
                       (mumbles)
                something I've observed.

                             JUDY
                Wanker. It's okay. It's fine. It's
                probably just the stress of this awful,
                awful war.

      Malcolm drags the ambassador into a corner.

                             MALCOLM
                We're in a new reality now and You've got
                to speed things up.

                             SIR JONATHAN
                What things? Speed up what?
                             MALCOLM
                The debate. It needs to start at eleven
                o'clock, not one thirty.

                             SIR JONATHAN
                Hehe. Can I perhaps briefly explain the
                way the process works? And why that isn't
                possible? You see through that door there
                are a number of secretariats that are
                currently doing what we call the washing
                up now...

                             MALCOLM
                Just fucking do it, fishlips. Otherwise
                you'll find yourself in some medieval
                warzone in the Caucasus with your arse in
                the air, trying to persuade a group of
                men in balaclavas that sustained sexual
                violence is not the way forward.

                No, it can't be. I mean it could be done,
                it just can't.

                             MALCOLM
                Then I'll do it.
                       (motioning to a door)
                They're through there?

                             SIR JONATHAN
                Yes but you can't go in, that would be a
                serious breach of protocol ...

      He's blocking Malcolm. Malcolm grabs his hand.

                             MALCOLM
                Then you do it. Get in there.

      He is almost man-handling him in.
                             SIR JONATHAN
                I'm not dancing with you Malcolm.

                             MALCOLM
                I'm leading, look follow my lead.

                             SIR JONATHAN
                You're not dancing me into the
                secretariat!

      Jonathan breaks off and under his own steam prepares to
      go in.

      As Malcolm is leaving Miller blocks his path.
                             MALCOLM
                Where's the intel? Are you sure you're
                working as hard as me? Cos I'm sweating
                spinal fluid here. I'm a husk.

                             MILLER
                You get everything you need?

                             MALCOLM
                       (in a hurry)
                Oh yeah I think so. Thanks.
                       (a beat, thinks)
                Oh, Whoa whoa whoa just a wee moment
                General Flintstone. Was it you? Did you
                leak Pwip Pip? I know you can't fire a
                gun, but can you use a fax?

                             MILLER
                No, see, because I'm upfront about what I
                do. I don't creep around like some
                fucking gay mercenary doing other
                people's dirty work.

                             MALCOLM
                I'm doing my own work. I'm doing my job.

                             MILLER
                Uh-hu. I think you're doing Linton's
                dirty work. I think you're his English
                bitch and if I walked into your hotel
                room tonight I'd find you on all fours in
                fishnets and him hanging out the back of
                you.

                             MALCOLM
                Oooo. Tough talk from the armchair
                General. What you going to do? Throw a
                cushion at me? Put your feet up on a poof
                and go back to sleep why don't you?

                             GENERAL MILLER
                Listen, Tucker, you may be some scary
                poodlefucker back in London, but here?
                You know what you look like? A fucking
                squeezed dick. You got a blue vein
                running all the way up to your temple
                there. That's where I'd put the fucking
                bullet. But I'd stand well back. You look
                like you'd be a squirter.

                             MALCOLM
                Have you ever even killed anybody?
                Really?

                             GENERAL MILLER
                Yep.

                             MALCOLM
                Falling asleep on someone doesn't count.

                             GENERAL MILLER
                       (closer)
                I've done my share. How many you kill,

                             MALCOLM
                Personally, I prefer maiming.

                             GENERAL MILLER
                Go on, tough guy, take a swing at me.
                I'll smack you so fucking hard you'll be
                shitting teeth.

      They eyeball each other. Is Miller going to hit him? He
      doesn't.

                             MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                Right. Do excuse me. I've got work to do.

101   INT. UN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                              101

      Sir Jonathan walks in. A lot of faces are turned towards
      him, expectantly.

                             SIR JONATHAN
                Hello everyone. I was wondering if I
                might suggest a cheeky early vote? Bit of
                an adventure. Maybe, we could knock off
                early, go for a drink? Ha. I'm kidding.
                Or am I? No, I am.

102   INT. KAREN CLARK'S UN OFFICE - DAY                         102

      Karen and Miller are looking at a computer screen,
      presumably reading about Simon's floated resignation.

                             KAREN
                       (looking at computer)
                There it is. Simon's going. Everyone's
                saying he's going.

      Simon passes their open door.

                             GENERAL MILLER
                       (spotting Simon)
                Simon! There he is! Simon.
                       (re internet)
                This is great shit. I wasn't sure you had
                the nerve. You're resigning?

                             SIMON
                Ah okay. They're not running with that? I
                have not said that.

                             GENERAL MILLER
                You're not resigning?

                             KAREN
                You're still playing the hawk?

                             SIMON
                It's much subtler than that. It's
                nuanced. I'm playing a much cleverer game
                than that. I'm a
                       (whispering)
                fake hawk.

                     I'm sorry?

                                  SIMON
                            (whispering)
                     Fake hawk.

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     You're a fake hawk? You're a fucking
                     idiot. You're not a fake idiot are you.

      Karen and Miller go into a confab.

      Karen and Miller immediately go into a huddle and start
      planning Simon's future.

                                  KAREN
                            (to General Miller, as if
                             Simon's not there)
                     We could just tell the press he's going
                     anyway. Say he's confirmed to us that
                     he's resigning.

                                  SIMON
                     Sorry?

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     I second that.

                                  SIMON
                     What? You can't.

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     Do we announce it before or after the
                     vote?
                                  KAREN
                     During. Then he can't do anything about
                     it.

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     Great. That's decided then.

                                  SIMON
                     No. No it's bloody not. I'm - me. You're
                     not me. I decide about all the main
                     things about me, okay? Not you. Me.

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     No. No Simon. I'm afraid not. Not on this
                     one. This is too big for you.

                                  KAREN
                     Be realistic. You're being used. We all
                     are. The one thing we can do now to
                     influence things is to resign. Sacrifice
                     ourselves. That's our only weapon.

                No, not like a suicide bomber. A suicide
                bomber gets to make a decision.

      working on laptops. They're at right-angles to each
      other. Toby has a view of Liza. She's facing away from

      Simon is sitting in the Meditation Room, a stark chapel-
      like room with a big piece of granite in the middle of
      it. He's biting his nails, thinking.

      Judy comes in.

                                 JUDY
                     You okay?

                                  SIMON
                     I'm thinking of becoming a suicide

                                  JUDY
                     That's certainly a very powerful way of
                     getting your point across.

      He pulls out some mints.

                                  SIMON
                     Would you like a mint?

                                  JUDY
                     I'm okay thanks. Are you thinking to
                     overdose on mints? Because...

      Simon eats a mint.
      He's lost in his own world. Staring, maybe slightly
      nodding at the thoughts in his own head.

                                  SIMON
                     Do you like me Judy?

                                  JUDY
                     You're my boss.

                                  SIMON
                     Yeah, but do you actually like me.

      A beat.

                                  JUDY
                     Sure. Look, I'll leave you to your
                     thoughts.

                     staring vacantly into space while a
                     distant voice in the back of my head goes
                     "oh shit" like a car alarm in the middle
                     of the night.

      Simon eats another mint. Sits there noisily sucking it.
      Judy leaves.

                     Was it you?

                                    SUZY
                     Was what me?

                                  JAMIE
                     Was it fucking you!? Answer the question!
                                  MICHAEL
                     She can't very well answer the question
                     if you don't tell her what it is, can
                     she?

                                  JAMIE
                     Fuck off to your room, Count of Cunty
                     Cristo, this is between me and her.
                            (to Suzy)
                     You leaked Liza Weld's paper to the BBC.
                     Tell me you leaked it.

                                  SUZY
                     I didn't leak anything. I don't know what
                     you're talking about.

                                  JAMIE
                     You're lying. You touched your nose.
                     That's what's called a `tell'. You are
                     lying.

                                    SUZY
                     No I'm not.

                                  JAMIE
                     `No I'm not.' That's a tell as well.
                     Classic.
                            (changing tack to terror)
                     I know the leak came from here, from this
                     fucking fax machine here.

      He pushes a fax casually off the table onto the floor.

                                  JAMIE (CONT'D)
                     This is what I'm doing to the machine.
                            (he kicks it, hard till bits
                             start to break off, but he's
                             still quite controlled
                             talking, as he kicks more)
                     You see? This is how angry I am with the
                     piece of office equipment which leaked
                     this document, so can you imagine how
                     angry I am with the person who did it?
                     Yeah? Can you Suzy?

      He kicks the fax machine again.

                                    MICHAEL
                     It was me.

                                  JAMIE
                     Oh fuck off. Don't come over all
                     Spartacus now.

                                    MICHAEL
                     I leaked it.
                                    JAMIE
                     What?

      Advances on Michael, becomes aware of the music. Jamie
      points to the CD player.

                                  JAMIE (CONT'D)
                     Okay for a start turn that fucking row
                     off. It's just fucking vowels. Listen to
                     it. Just subsidised fucking foreign
                     vowels. You only listen to that shit
                     because it's bad form to actually wear a
                     big hat that says "I went to private
                     school".

      Michael doesn't turn it off, so Jamie does.

                                  JAMIE (CONT'D)
                     Who did you leak it to?

                             MICHAEL
                I just sent it. I thought it was
                important so I sent it through.

                             JAMIE
                       (considers then, )
                Ok. See this fax machine?(kick) That's
                your career. I'm pretty sure it's fucked.
                Let me just check (kick). Yeah, it is.
                Plus, breach of Official Secrets, so
                that's fucking swannee. Maybe you can get
                a part time job in West End as a
                gentleman's fluffer. Or whatever the fuck
                they call it these days.

      Jamie is heading off.

                             MICHAEL
                Well, you know -- better to go out with a
                bang...
                             JAMIE
                No, no. I will not allow this to be a
                bang. This will be a whimper, a tiny
                pathetic whimper like a puppy being
                fucked by a big metal puppy-fucking
                machine. And they do exist, `cos my
                gran's got one.

      Jamie leaves.


106   INT. UN MEDITATION ROOM - DAY                                106

      Malcolm and Linton enter. We see Simon's mints lying on
      the big stone in the middle of the room.

                             LINTON
                So we're down to the wire here, Mr
                Miracle Worker, what have you got for me?
                What intel have you rustled us up?

                             MALCOLM
                Honestly? I haven't got it. We need more
                time.

                             LINTON
                You haven't got it? Can you delay the
                vote to give you time to get it?

                             MALCOLM
                No. I've had the vote brought forward.

      Simon comes in to retrieve his mints.

                             SIMON
                Just getting my mints.

                                  LINTON
                     I am telling you to delay the vote and
                     get me some new intel. Now.

                                  MALCOLM
                     Okay, quick reality check, J Edgar
                     Fucking Hoover. I don't work for you. You
                     don't tell me what to fucking do.

                                  LINTON
                     Well firstly, don't raise your voice.
                     This is a sacred space. You may not
                     believe that, I may not believe that, but
                     by God it's a useful hypocrisy. And
                     secondarily you do work for me. Your
                     prime minister instructed you to work for
                     me.

      Malcolm glances at Simon.
                                  MALCOLM
                     Get your Polos and fuck off.

      Simon stays where he is. Linton starts laughing. Toby
      enters, watches in amazement.

                                  LINTON
                     The great Malcolm Tucker. One of your
                     guys has leaked a paper, you can't do
                     anything. We tell you to get intel, you
                     can't do anything. I need the vote put
                     back - you can't do anything. You, sir,
                     are a useless piece of `S' star star `T'.

      A beat.
                                  MALCOLM
                            (quietly, to Toby)
                     What do you want?

                                  TOBY
                     We've just heard -- the wall's starting
                     to collapse. A brick has fallen. That's
                     the news I'm getting. More to follow.
                     Both news and bricks.

      Linton laughs again.

                                  LINTON
                     Why don't you deal with that Tucker? A
                     wall is falling down, that's more your
                     level. I can see you with your shirt off
                     and a wheelbarrow whistling a happy song.

      Linton walks out.

                You've been working for him?

                             MALCOLM
                It's complicated, okay? I've been
                juggling a number of responsibilities.

      Simon stares at Malcolm. He takes a mint and pops it in
      his mouth.

                             SIMON
                Okay, well, right, after the vote, I
                resign.

                             MALCOLM
                Look. It's too late now. Resigning. It's
                not worth it. The horse has bolted. It's
                out there getting shot now.

                             SIMON
                I'll see you later, Malcolm.

      Simon exits.

                             MALCOLM
                       (to Toby)
                If you repeat this to anyone I will pull
                your leg off, break it in two and stab
                you to death with your broken shin bone.
                Now go away.

      Toby leaves.

      Malcolm sits down, head in his hands.

      Michael and Suzy in Michael's office, classical music in
      the background. Michael's clearing his desk, putting

                                  JAMIE
                     Right, Frank and Nancy Sinatra. I've got
                     good news. You're not fired. That's great
                     news, isn't it?

                                  MICHAEL
                     That sounds ominous.

                                  JAMIE
                     He's fucking delighted.
                            (cancels phone)
                     We want to put Liza Weld's Pwip Pip out
                     there, properly. In the public domain. We
                     just have to refine it a bit.

                                  SUZY
                     Refine it?

                     Changing his name doesn't make a
                     difference. The main source in there he's
                     not really called Ice Man, is he? "Mr and
                     Mrs Man, you've got a son, Ice." So we
                     change it, to another name. Who's the
                     fuck with the fiddle? The Fiddlefuck.

                     Okay, we'll call him Debussy.

                                   MICHAEL
                     No.

                                  JAMIE
                     And then you'll make a couple of other
                     changes. It'll mean your fingerprints are
                     on it, Mikey, but it's the only way to
                     save your job, you leaky fuck.

      Michael is now scared of what he's being asked to do.

                                  MICHAEL
                     It wasn't me, Jamie, alright? It wasn't
                     me. Don't make me do this. Someone else
                     must have come in and used the fax
                     machine.

                                  JAMIE
                     What? Oh, that thing about your fax?
                     Don't worry about that. I made that up.
                     The paper was sent by e-mail. It;s just,
                     the fax machine was there and it;s easier
                     to kick.

      Michael looks at Suzy. She doesn't know what to say or
      do.

                                  JAMIE (CONT'D)
                            (grabbing Michael)
                     Come on Deuce Bigalow. You're coming with
                     me.

      He drags Michael out of the office.


109   INT. UN CORRIDOR - DAY                                           109

      On the closed door of the Meditation Room. Malcolm
      suddenly bursts out, re-energised, ready for action. He's
      in the middle of a call.

                     Yeah, BBC newsdesk please. Malcolm
                     Tucker. (BEAT) Ben? Hi, how you doing?
                     Yeah, well, I'm hearing you're preparing
                     a story that we might not like.

      One of the doors he pushes open has a coffee machine in
      it. Toby is there getting a coffee. Malcolm gestures to
      him to come along. Toby joins Malc in his jog through the
      corridors, spilling his coffee on his hands as he goes
      and scalding himself.

                                  MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                     I just want to say please, this garden
                     wall story, please don't run with it.
                            (beat, winks at Toby - you
                             getting this?)
                     Simon Foster's constituency-office wall?
                     You've got that haven't you? I haven't
                     let the cat out of the bag? Shit. Look,
                     my reputation will be in tatters if you
                     run with...
                            (to Toby)
                     And he's gone. Boo hoo. I've got a hard
                     on.

                                  TOBY
                     Can we stop running because my hands are
                     really rather badly burned now.

      They stop.

                                  MALCOLM
                     I know it was you who leaked Linton's War
                     Committee.
                                  TOBY
                     Oh? Right.
                            (tries it out for size)
                     It wasn't?

                                  MALCOLM
                     Are you telling me it wasn't you? Is that
                     your proposition? Is that want you want
                     to say if I ask them to fly you to Diego
                     Garcia and slip a hood over your head and
                     carry out a cavity search?

                            (covering)
                     I don't actually recall. It was a busy
                     time.

                                  MALCOLM
                     That's more like it. So...you are now on

                   I am giving you a probationary period,
                   which will last from today...until the

                               TOBY
                   Okay.

                   You're my guy now. I own you now. You're
                   my Kunte Kinte. Go and get your laptop.

      Toby goes.

      Malcolm pushes open another door. Sir Jonathan Tutt is in
      there.

                                MALCOLM (CONT'D)
                   Ah, ambassador -- with your big baldy
                   head you are spoiling us.

                                SIR JONATHAN
                   Good, I've been looking for you. I needed
                   to tell you that by a huge personal
                   effort -- huge --I have managed to bring
                   the vote forward by an hour and a half.

                                MALCOLM
                   Great. I need it delayed now.

                                SIR JONATHAN
                   Very funny. That is funny.

                                MALCOLM
                   By an hour, at least. Although I guess
                   two and a half hours now, as you've
                   brought it forward.
                                SIR JONATHAN
                   No, I'm sorry I'm very sorry but I won't
                   humiliate myself again.

                                MALCOLM
                   You do what I say or you can go and see
                   if Belize are looking for a new
                   ambassador but with a broken nose, one
                   bollock, and a half-chewed cock.

      him, expectantly.

      Jamie has taken Michael into a tiny windowless office.
      Michael's hunched at his laptop, looking at the Pwip-Pip
      document on his computer. Jamie stands right over him,
      ominously.

                             JAMIE
                       (to Michael re: the office)
                This is nice isn't it? Cosy. Away from
                prying eyes.

                             MICHAEL
                So what's this, your political wet-room?

      Jamie's phone goes.

      Toby is standing in front of Malcolm, holding his laptop
      up for Malcolm to look at and a physical copy of the red
      Pwip-Pip folder. He's also got the Pwip-Pip file on
      screen.

                             MALCOLM
                Is it up, have you got it up?

                             JAMIE
                Yeah it's all fine.

                             MALCOLM

                       (to Michael)
                Go to page nine.

      Michael does.

                             MALCOLM
                Highlight from that page to the end of
                the document.

                             JAMIE
                Do you mean select?

                     Is it highlighted?

                                  MALCOLM
                     Okay, right, standby ... delete!

                            (subdued)
                     You can't just delete the arguments
                     against the war.

      Michael stops what he's doing.

                     Messenger! Get Messenger up!

      Toby sticks Pwip-Pip in his mouth so he's got a hand free
      to initiate MSN messenger.

                                  JAMIE
                     Oh hang on Malc. Michael's stopped
                     moving. I think he's crashed.
      Malcolm types something on the laptop while Toby holds it
      up for him.

                                  MALCOLM
                     Have you tried hitting him? Give him a
                     thump, that usually works.

                                  JAMIE

                     manual over-ride.

      Jamie picks up Michael's hand and pulls out his index
      finger and places it on the delete key.

                     No, it's okay. It's working again.

      Malc hands over the folder and walks out.

      Linton, with Adriano now back beside him AND LIZA, is
      waiting for hush from the assembled US delegation,

                 I don't know. I haven't read it
                 personally. No time. But it certainly
                 raised your profile.
                              LIZA
                 No. That old thing? That was like a
                 thousand years ago. More maybe.

                 So, I'll keep this brief and   to the
                 point. We go in, we make our   case using
                 the new British intelligence   from their
                 source `Debussy', we win the   argument, we

      The Brit delegation are gathered round a screen in a
      corridor showing the main debating chamber. The mood is
      sombre.

                        (on screen)
                 Resolution 5977 is passed.

      Judy looks at Malcolm. Malcolm looks straight ahead at
      the screen, nods, impassive.

                              SIMON
                 Yup. That's that then.

                              TOBY
                 "That's that then"? That's your quote for

                     said "That's that, then. Anyone want a

      A TV shows BBC News 24's report on the vote. Jamie is
      stroking Michael's hair in a sweet and therefore very
      very scary way. Michael's staring ahead pretending it
      isn't happening.

                                  JAMIE
                            (sweetly)

      Karen enters. Chad is there too with General Miller.

                                  KAREN
                     So, I emailed my resignation ten minutes
                     ago.
                            (to Miller)
                     Yours should come right after the

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     I've been thinking Karen. This has been
                     the hardest fucking decision of my
                     political life. I'm not resigning.

                                  KAREN
                     What the fuck George. Seriously? You said
                     that the war was intolerable and we'd go
                     together.

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     It is - it is intolerable. I still agree
                     with myself about that. But I've got to
                     tolerate it. My loyalty is with the kids.
                     At the end of the day I'm a soldier.

                                  KAREN
                     You're not a soldier.

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     Look at the uniform, Karen. I'm not a
                     pastry chef. I have military
                     commendations on my chest, not a little
                     fucking label saying My Name Is George.

                                  KAREN
                     You're a politician. You live on canapes
                     and white wine and you have three
                     anecdotes you wheel out at every party
                     and you scour the national papers for
                     mentions of your name. You're a fucking
                     politician.

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     I'm still a soldier.
                                  KAREN
                     When was the last time you shot a guy?

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     What, if I haven't shot a guy in 15 years
                     then I'm not a soldier? City hall don't
                     insist I bring along a fucking bullet-
                     ridden corpse every five years to renew
                     my soldier licence.

                                  KAREN
                     You know this is an unnecessary war. It's
                     a war you don't believe in. Show me some
                     balls, George.

                                  GENERAL MILLER
                     I know I've got balls, I don't need to
                     show them to you.

                  cotton Ralph Lauren shorts on a

                               GENERAL MILLER
                  Don't talk about my fucking balls that
                  way. My balls have been around. My balls
                  have got balls.

      Karen turns away from him.

                  Er, I might, stay with the General
                  actually Karen, if that's okay? If he's
                  staying I might stay with him and see
                  what assistance I can furnish.

                  Okay. General Shrek and his faithful
                  talking donkey.

      She goes.

                  This takes balls Karen.

                               CHAD
                  You've got balls Sir. Anyone can see
                  you've got big balls. They're two-thirds
                  of a snowman.

                               GENERAL MILLER
                  Get the fuck away from me.

      Miller walks off.

                China, suggesting you are the only
                political fuck-up visible from space.
                Look at this. No one could survive this.
                The PM is very clear on this - you're
                sacked, over the wall.

                             MALCOLM
                I have spoken to the Prime Minister.
                Whether it has happened or not is
                irrelevant. It is true. As soon as I
                heard about the wall, I spoke to him and
                he decided you had to go.

                             SIMON
                I'm not going quietly.
                             MALCOLM
                Yeah well if you try to turn this into
                some anti-war protest, you can expect
                your `mountain of conflict' soundbite to
                be everywhere from ringtones to a fucking
                dance mix on YouTube. I will marshall all
                the forces of media darkness to hound you
                to an assisted suicide.

      for him to go.

                `I heart Huckabees' should be on the list
                of dvds suitable for forces
                entertainment. That self-indulgent crap
                is not suitable entertainment for combat
                troops. And where's `United 93' on here?
                That should be playing 24/7.

                Well Alan, I have been balled out by
                Linton for allowing I Heart Huckabees on
                to the troops DVD roster. You know the
                phrase, "I'm too old for this shit? Well,

      Malcolm is walking through the open-plan office with
      Judy. In the background we see Toby getting the last of
      his things together.

      The NEW MINISTER and her ADVISOR arrive. They are almost
      carbon copies of Simon and Toby.

                                  MALCOLM
                     Ah, here they are. Minister. Elizabeth.
                     Welcome aboard.

                                  MINISTER
                     Thanks Malcolm. Looking forward to it.
                     War seems to be going `great guns' at the
                     moment.
                                  MALCOLM
                     Ah, cheeky! Let me take you out for an
                     expensive lunch, roast swan and all the
                     trimmings, and I'll bring you up to speed
                     on the whole Middle East situation.

                                  MINISTER
                     Are you twisting my arm already?

                                  MALCOLM
                     Aye, but in a friendly, non-breaky way.
                     Watch your step there. There's still
                     blood on the deck.
                                  ADVISOR
                            (to Judy)
                     Hi I'm Danny. Dan. I'm Elizabeth's chief
                     advisor.

                     Have I got a desk?

                                  JUDY
                     Yes, it's that one there.

      She points at Toby's desk. The Minister and his advisor
      start making themselves at home.

      We stay on Toby now as Malcolm and Judy greet the new
      guys.

      and them we follow him as he heads down the front steps.

          That's right. C2rn.
          A HUGE COMBINE enters frame and turns down a row. The camera
          follows it. We are in the middle of a massive corn field in
          SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. The wind creates swells in the corn like
          a great green and gold sea. The farm equipment accelerates as
          does Whitacre...

          .Bacon and eggs is really just
          corn and corn when you think about
          what they feed the chickens and the

          WHITACRE, 33, drives his young son ALEXANDER, 6, to school.
          Whitacre is as happy as God makes creatures. Alexander sips
          his half-pint carton of ORANGE JUICE.

                         WHITACRE
          Do you?
          Alexander hazards a guess.

          Corn starch. But, Daddy's company
          didn't come up with that one--
          DuPont did...
          Whitacre tussles his hair. They drive by a GAS STATION in the
          middle of the cornfields. He continues his ode to corn in
          his head...

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          Ethanol is made of corn; that's
          ADM. Car corn. Like gasoline. But
          they also use it for scotch, gin
          and vodka ...Corn and tonic... corn
          gimlet...corn on the rocks.

          warped in the reflection...

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Porsche or Porsh-a. I've heard it
          both ways. Three years in Germany,
          I should know that. What's the
          German word for corn? The word I
          really like saying is
          "kugelschreiber." That's "pen"--
          all those syllables just for "pen."

          A PEN SIGNS A LEDGER
          Whitacre signs in with the security gate at ARCHER DANIELS
          MIDLAND headquarters in Decatur. A sprawling industrial
          facility that makes most of what America eats. Grain
          elevators, cooling towers, processing plants, loading docks
          and a six story concrete bunker of an office building. He
          parks his car in a monogrammed space.

          3 INTERIOR ADM HEADQUARTERS-CONTINUOUS 3
          Whitacre walks across the open trading floor where soy and
          corn futures from around the world are displayed on a tote
          board and into his glass walled office.
          He has a kind word for everyone. Smile flashing like a
          casino sign. He sees his pal Kirk Schmidt from accounting...

                         WHITACRE
          Hey there, howdy. Hey, Kirk, we
          got to get out and hit some
          balls ...Morning...Guten Tag...
          Whitacre scans the room full of busy co-workers. His
          secretary, LIZ TAYLOR, 35, wears earrings that are EARS OF
          CORN made of gold.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          What do they pay Kirk. . .What does a
          guy like that get...100K...I bet he
          gets a 100. He's just going to sit
          behind that desk and ride it into
          the future...

          She hands him a folder. He opens it and scans the data. He
          nods.

          Whitacre walks among the giant fermenters-- he's joined by a
          DISCOURAGED FOREMAN. They check various gauges and dials
          showing proof of failure.

                         DISCOURAGED FOREMAN
          We adjusted the dextrose again, but
          the vrus keeps showing
          up-Thought we had it surrounded
          this time. We're starting a new set
          of cultures...

                         WHITACRE
          We'll Vet it. We just gotta stay
          after it. The things eat sugar and
          that's what we're giving them-- a
          warm place filled with sugar.
          They walk into a clean room full of flasks mechanically
          shaken like paint cans-- it's too loud to speak. Each flask
          is connected to a feed tube-- the cultures are administered
          to by a HALF DOZEN BIO TECH WORKERS. Whitacre watches. He
          focuses on one worker-- she's ASIAN. She adds some nutrients
          to the feed line.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          A positive mental attitude is a
          real important thing. They've done
          studies where heart patients who
          have people praying for them
          actually do better than ones who
          don't. There's science for you.
          The cheerleaders might make a
          difference in the game after
          all...How do you know what the
          electrical energy of a thought
          actually does when it's out there
          in the world? It's gotta go
          somewhere...so you might as well
          smile. Takes less muscles than
          frowning...
          Whitacre closes the door on the very loud room.

           Whitacre sits with MICK ANDREAS, Vice Chairman, 45, and TERRY
          WILSON, 55, President. An overhead projector displays the

          We're not gonna get anywhere near
          that. We got 150 million dollars in
          costs over there guys. I can see
          the fucking thing from my swimming
          pool and it makes me want to drown
          myself every morning.

                         (TO WHITACRE)
          I don't give a shit about the
          Japanese. You just gotta get the
          Goddamn lysine bugs to eat the
          dextrose and shit us out some
          money.

                         WHITACRE
          We're still having problems with
          this virus.

                         ANDREAS
          I don't want to hear about the damn
          virus anymore. Terry, what are we
          losing a month?

                         WILSON
          We're off like seven million per.

                         ANDREAS
          That's not gonna fly much longer.
          You want to go in there next
          quarter and tell the board that
          we're sucking hind tit on
          this...cuz' I sure don't.
          He gives Whitacre a cold, hard, we're--done-fucking-around-
          glare.

                         ANDREAS
          Fix the Goddamn plant, or we're
          gonna shut it down.

          was Homecoming Queen then. Either would be hard pressed to

          The pilgrims loved the corn-- they
          came for the religious freedom but
          they stayed for the corn-- but its
          missing three of your eight
          essential amino acids-- especially
          lysine. That's why the Indians ate
          it with beans or lime. You feed a
          chicken corn and it gets sick. Yo
          feed it corn and lysine and it goes
          from egg to supermarket fryer in
          six months instead of eight...
          Whitacre gazes over at a plate of fried chicken, and then at
          his wife. She has gotten dressed up for dinner. She looks

          The Regent? What a bed! If you

          Sixth grade. Marty Blocker used to
          sell us Charm's Blow Pops for three
          cents, which was a great deal cuz
          at Valley Drug they cost a nickel.
          He said his Dad worked for Charms--
          said he invented the Blow Pop and
          got a special deal-- like a life
          time supply. Then they opened his
          locker..cuz of all the ants... In a
          line.. .His Dad worked for the post
          office, he came down to the school
          in his uniform. Nothing ever
          happened to Marty-- just ants ...He
          blew off part of his thumb on the

          9 INTERIOR MICK ANDREAS' OFFICE ADM- MORNING 9
          At 6:30 the next morning Whitacre walks across the ADM
          trading floor and straight into Mick Andreas' office looking
          flustered.

                         WHITACRE
          Mick you're not going to believe
          what the hell's happened. I think
          I know the reason why we've been
          having all these problems at the
          plant.

                         ANDREAS
          Well, I've only been asking you to
          come up with one for the past eight
          weeks. I'm all ears.
          Whitacre paces. His story comes out in a rush of words.
          Andreas listens silently.

                         WHITACRE
          It's not start-up problems like we
          thought. It's the Japanese. This
          guy Fujiwara from Ajinomoto, he's
          been calling me-- sometimes at
          work, sometimes at home cuz of the
          time difference-- you met him, he
          was here a couple of weeks ago.

                         (MORE)

                          WHITACRE (CONT'D)
           Well last night he calls me at home
          just after 8, and Mick, he knew
           everything. He says to me, `You
          remember the total nightmare you
          had during May, June and July?'
          And before I can ask him what he
          means he says, `Those months when
          ADM was losing about seven million
          dollars a month in the lysine
          business?'
          Whitacre stares at Andreas in shock-- no one outside the
          company should know that. Andreas is still stone faced.

                         WHITACRE
          I couldn't believe it. But, Mick
          before I can even ask him how he
          got those numbers, he starts making
          little comments about us having
          microbe problems. Jokes, like he's
          toying with me.
          Whitacre is fuming now-- his voice unnaturally high.

                         WHITACRE
          And then he tells me that one of
          our highest paid employees is
          actually an employee of Ajinomoto
          and is sabotaging the plant.
          They're injecting some kind of
          virus into the dextrose and
          contaminating the whole deal.
          That's the problem. I'll tell you
          Mick, it's like Rising Sun, that
          Crichton book, it's just like it.
          Fujiwara even said that his boss,
          Ikeda, would have him killed if he
          knew he was calling. So I asked
          him why he was talking to me and he
          said-- he said-- he wants 10
          million dollars. 10 million and
          he'll tell us who the saboteur is
          and give us a new lysine bug that's
          immune to the virus. We could be
          up and running in three days...
          Andreas pauses, takes it all in, and then...

                         ANDREAS
          How well do you know this guy?

                         WHITACRE
          Uh, um, well I met him a few weeks
          ago when he came over. And then,
          he called a couple of times...

                         ANDREAS
          So, not very well?

          Very well? No, I can't really say
          that.
          Andreas ponders the situation.

                         ANDREAS
          Okay, if you hear from him again--
          talk him down on the price. I want
          you to find out the least amount of
          money he'd settle for. If we can
          get a bug that's resistant to the
          virus, it might be worth it...But,
          I want you to keep this quiet, if
          there is a mole, we don't want him
          to know we're onto him.

          Whitacre stands with a cocktail in the fading light, looking
          at the foundation for the NEW HORSE STABLES being built
          across the road from the main house. There is not another
          home anywhere nearby.

          This'd be a great place for some
          outlet stores... People would come
          from all over Southern Illinois and
          probably Missouri, too. Famous
          name brand labels and appliances at
          savings of up to fifty per cent
          every day. Maybe a food court with
          a Mexican place. . .After the
          stables, maybe a tennis court or a
          little pitch and putt by the pool--
          that adds to resale value like
          nobody's business...
          Whitacre looks at the swarm of insects around a street
          light...

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          The birds eat the bugs, the cars

          Stunned by the news.

          The FBI! God, no.
          Andreas and MARK CHEVIRON, 38, tell Whitacre of his upcoming
          FBI interview. Cheviron is a barrel chested, linebacker of a
          man. A former Decatur cop who is now Private Industry's
          version of a bouncer.

          getting him down on the price.
          That's what you told me to do and I
          was doing it.

          We don't like the idea of talking
          to the FBI anymore than you do.
          Look, they're just going to tape

           SPECIAL AGENT BRIAN SHEPARD, 43, sits with Cheviron and a
          very anxious Mark Whitacre. Shepard wears a rumpled dark
          suit and tie from the day Jay Edgar Hoover set a dress code.
          He has been stationed in Decatur where the odd dead body in a
          river and a convenience store robbery that traversed state
          lines have made up the last fifteen years of his life.
          Whitacre shifts restlessly in his seat. Cheviron on the other
          hand is an old hand at this. He watches Whitacre and says
          nothing. Shepard writes down everything.

                         WHITACRE
          He told me he wanted his payments
          deposited by wire transfer to
          numbered bank accounts in
          Switzerland and the Caribbean.

                         SHEPARD
          And when was your last contact with
          him?

                         WHITACRE
          Two days ago. But I think he's
          getting suspicious. I've dragged
          this out as long as I can. If we
          don't get back to him soon he may
          back out?

          And these calls, they've been
          coming in on your home line?
          Whitacre looks at Cheviron-- there's clearly a right and
          wrong answer here.

          I can help with that.

                         WHITACRE
          So, that's it then. I can go?
          Shepard hands Whitacre his card. They shake hands.

                         SHEPARD
          I'd like to come out tomorrow and
          get on that phone.

                         WHITACRE
          No problem. Thanks for your time.

          Whitacre comes in from a long day at work. Ginger walks in
          from the kitchen. She gives him a welcome home hug-- but he
          doesn't let go-- holding on like a man caught in the current.

                         GINGER
          You told them the truth, Mark.
          That's all you can do.

          They we're watching me the whole
          time. Cheviron was in the room.
          She slips from his arms-- disappointed.

                         WHITACRE
          I never even got a chance.
          She doesn't accept his excuse and heads upstairs to bed.

                         GINGER
          Tanya called from school-- she has
          homework questions for you.
          Whitacre stands in the vestibule alone. He walks through the
          big house shutting off lights-- he sits in a chair in the
          huge living room and leafs through an issue of NATIONAL

          GEOGRAPHIC.

          CHEVIRON (O.S.)
          What?

                         WHITACRE
          They're threatening my daughter.
          She got a call at school. She's
          fourteen!

          CHEVIRON (O.S.)
          Slow down, Mark.

                         WHITACRE
          She said the guy sounded Asian.
          They told her Fujiwara couldn't
          wait.

          CHEVIRON (O.S.)
          Did you call the FBI?

                         WHITACRE
          It just happened. He wants an
          answer. Or, he said she's in
          trouble.

          CHEVIRON (O.S.)
          We'll talk about it in the morning.

                         WHITACRE
          I'm thinking about quitting. Moving
          my family out of here. I can't do
          this.

          CHEVIRON (O.S.)
          We'll talk in the morning.
          Whitacre puts down the phone and walks through the large,
          dark house. He opens the bedroom door and the wedge of light
          finds Ginger already half-asleep. He lies down next to her
          in bed fully clothed.

          Cheviron, Whitacre and Mick Andreas. Whitacre is still
          agitated.

                         ANDREAS
          You ever mention to Fujiwara where
          your daughter went to school?

          If the guy wants to threaten you--
          why not just call you?

                         WHITACRE
          He told her to write down the
          message.

                         ANDREAS
          I want her to tell the FBI what
          they said.
          Andreas moves toward the phone.

                         WHITACRE
          I don't want her talking to the
          FBI, definitely not.

                         CHEVIRON
          Why not, Mark? Come on, if she's
          really in danger.

                         ANDREAS
          Then I'll talk to her.
          Andreas picks up the phone. Whitacre doesn't want that
          either.

                         WHITACRE
          She's scared enough.

                         ANDREAS
          If someone's threatening her...
          A beat. Whitacre collapses-- there's more to this.

                         WHITACRE
          Don't call her...No one's
          threatening. I, uh...
          A long painful beat.

                         WHITACRE
          I made it up. I lied. There wasn't
          any threat.
          Cheviron shakes his head in disgust.

                         CHEVIRON
          Christ, what a waste of time.
          Andreas lowers his gaze at Whitacre-- he wants an
          explanation.

          really got to me last night.
          He's twisting in the wind.

                         WHITACRE
          I figured if you guys thought my
          daughter was in danger you'd just
          pay Fujiwara and all this FBI stuff
          would go away. It was a stupid
          move on my part.
          Whitacre's ashamed.

                          WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. Stupid, stupid move.
          He gets up and leaves in humiliation. He wanders through the
          lobby of ADM in a daze.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          What am I supposed to do? I didn't
          get the FBI involved-- I was told
          we were paying the money. It's
          like, `Whitacre go out for a long
          pass,' and then we run the ball.
          Look, I admitted I made a mistake,
          that's more than I can say for most
          people. Hey, when they found out
          that Mick's Dad, Dwayne, wrote a
          check to the Watergate Burglars--
          did he admit it? Besides these guys
          probably own the FBI with the money
          they have. They probably wanted me
          to move into Dwayne's old house--
          because they've got it wired like
          in a Crichton novel...

          draped tables, botanical drawings of the state flower on the

          be paying off the waitresses here
          at the club. That's how business

          sentence.

          You gotta minute.
          Whitacre walks past his wife toward the car. Ginger squeezes
          his hand as he passes her on the steps.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Most of what we do is to impress
          girls-- I bet there are guys-- like
          circus guys who fall off the tight
          rope and on the way down all they
          think about are girls until they
          hit the ground-- not even about
          growing wings real fast-- just
          girls going by-They were going to
          find out anyway cuz' of Mick... Who
          knows what Mick and Dwayne have

          I think they might have it bugged.
          We're safer out here.
          Shepard is confused.

          Bugged? What?
          Whitacre takes a moment-- but decides to go on.

                         WHITACRE
          This used to be Dwayne Andreas'
          house, you know that?

          I'm aware of that.

                         WHITACRE
          There are things I know, but if I
          decide to tell you what's going on,
          could I be prosecuted for it?

          I can't provide you with immunity,
          but any information you tell me
          about your involvement in criminal
          activity would be discussed with
          the US attorney's office in a
          favorable light.
          Whitacre stares forward-- a beat. Shepard gets out his
          notebook.

                         WHITACRE
          Everything I told you yesterday
          about Fujiwara was true-- except
          one thing. I never received a call
          from him on the office line.
          Shepard looks at Whitacre-- he's confused.

                         SHEPARD
          Why did you tell me that you did?

                         WHITACRE
          Before I spoke with you, Mick
          Andreas and Mark Cheviron coached
          me on what to say. They told me to
          tell you that the calls came in on
          my business line, instead of my
          home line.

                         SHEPARD
          Why?
          Whitacre pauses again. It's too late to turn back.

                         WHITACRE
          What I'm about to tell you involves
          something very large. This
          extortion attempt by Fujiwara is
          nothing compared to it.
          Shepard says nothing.

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          It involves price fixing in the
          lysine business. I've been in
          several meetings with our Japanese
          and Korean competitors in the past
          few months where the sole purpose
          has been to fix prices. ADM made me
          go to these meetings.
          Shepard writes furiously, struggling to see in the dark.

                         WHITACRE
          That's why they wanted me to lie.
          Fujiwara's calling on my home line.
          But, so are the people we fix
          prices with. They didn't want you
          to hear those conversations so they
          told me to say the Fujiwara calls
          came in on the ADM line. But, I
          knew if you guys ever started
          looking at the records you'd see
          all these calls I have to Japan.
          And that's what scared me. Nobody
          has more calls than me. If you ever
          figured out about the price fixing,
          I'd be the fall guy.
          Shepard considers the explanation.

                         SHEPARD
          Who told you to participate in
          these price fixing talks?
          Whitacre pauses, summons his conviction.

                         WHITACRE
          I'm operating under the direction
          of Mick and Dwayne Andreas.

          No, what was said here was

          to my superiors Mark, and then
          we'll be in touch.

          mean just a straight shooter. I
          think we really got along-- I bet

          "Brian" instead of "Agent Shepard."
          "Bri." "Hey, Bri..." This must be

          CHEVIRON (O.S.)
          Brian, it's Mark Cheviron at ADM.

                         SHEPARD
          Yeah, Mark.

          CHEVIRON (O.S.)
          Hey, I asked you guys a couple of
          days ago which lines at Mark
          Whitacre's house you were going to
          be monitoring and we agreed it
          would just be the business line.
          So, that's all you did right?
          Beat.

                         SHEPARD
          I really can't answer that.

          36 INTERIOR ADM WHITACRE'S OFFICE- LATER 36
          Whitacre stares out through the glass walls drinking a COKE.
          Mick Andreas and Cheviron are making a bee-line for him.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          (off the Coke Can)
          It doesn't taste the same-- when
          Dwayne Andreas got the government
          to subsidize corn farmers-- it all
          changed. Corn syrup got to be
          cheaper than sugar-- so they went
          with the high fructose corn syrup
          from ADM.. .They said you couldn't
          tell the difference, but that's
          just a lie-Like when they
          replaced butter with topping at the
          movies.. .and you know who was
          behind that...

          Mick Andreas and Cheviron march into Whitacre's office on a
          mission.

                         ANDREAS
          We've decided that we're not going
          to be cooperating with any further
          FBI requests.
          Whitacre puts it all together. He is outraged. He turns on
          Cheviron.

                         WHITACRE
          I knew it! I knew it! I knew we
          should never have done this. I
          told you, but you wouldn't listen.
          They said just the office line...
          Cheviron has to eat shit here in front of Andreas.

                         CHEVIRON
          Evidently, they were lying to us,
          too.

                         WHITACRE
          Sounds to me like you can't keep
          track of what the FBI is doing.
          The phone buzzes.

                         LIZ TAYLOR

                         (ON INTERCOM)
          The call you were expecting, Mark.
          Whitacre pauses-- then picks up.

                         WHITACRE
          I'm working on this deal in Sweden,
          I have to take this.
          Whitacre picks up the phone. Andreas and Cheviron continue.

                         CHEVIRON
          I told Shepard we're done working
          with them as of now.

                         ANDREAS
          Damn right.
          Whitacre picks up the phone. It's not Sweden.

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          Mark, it's Brian can you talk?
          Whitacre shifts uncomfortably and tries to cover in front of
          Mick and Cheviron-- he puts on a phony cheerful voice.

          (over the phone)
          Yeah, hey it's good to hear from
          you.

          SHEPARD (O.S.)
          I'd like to bring my Supervisor by
          later, around six.

                         WHITACRE
          Great. Hey, I got Mr. Andreas in
          here right now. OK, I'll talk to
          you soon.
          He hangs up the phone and turns back to Mick and Terry.
          Whitacre smiles warmly, and then lies through his teeth.

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          So, what do I do if this Shepard
          guy calls?

                         ANDREAS
          You let me know and I'll pass it on
          to my Dad. But, you're done
          talking to them...

          37 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S BARN- EVENING 37
          Whitacre sits with FBI agents Shepard and Paisley in the
          converted barn. A large open room looking more like a theme
          restaurant than anything that might have once involved
          agriculture. Outside, RUSTY the gardener, fishes leaves from
          the pool. Shepard explains the misunderstanding with the
          phones.

                         PAISLEY
          The only listening device was the
          recorder, Mark.

                         SHEPARD
          We had a trap and trace device on
          the home line-- but we can't listen
          in with that.

                         PAISLEY
          However, the phone company calling
          people and telling them about our
          Intel gathering is, well, our face
          is red on that one.

                         SHEPARD
          Did you bring the expense reports
          we talked about?
          Whitacre gives them a folder of paperwork.

          It's all there-- Tokyo, Hong Kong,
          Paris and Mexico City.
          And under...Whitacre thinks about one thing while discussing
          another with the agents. He is a gifted man in this
          capacity. His thoughts take precedence here.

           WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.O.)
          Just last week Mick and Terry I read in the Geographic that
          were in Florida with the Corn the skin in ears grows from
          Refiner's Association. They the inside out-- conveyor
          would have their regular belt style. That's how they
          meetings during the day and stay clean. You could make a
          then at night they'd get dot with a felt tip inside
          together and work out the and watch it move down your
          price fixing... neck.

                         WHITACRE
          .Six months later a liter of
          Pepsi costs five cents more.

                         SHEPARD
          When's the next meeting?

                         WHITACRE
          January-- somewhere in Asia.
          Paisley takes it all in. He cozies up to Whitacre.

                         AGENT PAISLEY
          Mark, I gotta ask you, why are you
          doing this? We know you lied to us
          about the phone line and you're
          afraid of that. But, now you're
          telling us all this other stuff out
          of the blue. I gotta ask you why?
          The light disappears from Whitacre's eyes.

                         WHITACRE
          Things are going on I don't approve
          of. I mean, I'm a biochemist-- But,
          they pulled me into the business
          side and they're doing things that
          are illegal. They said...

          ANGLE ON RUSTY
          He takes the net for cleaning the pool and walks around the
          barn to the attached six car garage filled with a Range
          Rover, Ferrari, Mercedes Coupe, BMW, and a Lincoln Town Car.

           I had to be a part of the business
           side of things.
           Rusty pulls the garage down on the cars.

          38 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S BARN- CONTINUOUS

                         WHITACRE
          When they told me to lie, I had to
          lie. I lied to you guys and I feel
          real bad about it.
          This explains the bind Whitacre finds himself in.

                         SHEPARD
          You look at yourself as wearing a
          white hat and they're wearing black
          hats.

                         WHITACRE
          That's a good way to put it. You
          know, when I was a kid my folks
          died in an automobile accident. I
          was maybe six at the time and this
          wealthy man in Ohio adopted me. He
          owned amusement parks and he did
          real well for himself, real well. I
          got a big break-- went to a good
          school and all-- I adopted two kids
          of my own. I just want to do the
          right thing.

                         PAISLEY
          Well, Mark, do you think you'd be
          willing to go a few steps further
          in helping us?

                         WHITACRE
          What do you mean?

                         SHEPARD
          Would you be willing to wear a
          wire? We don't have any other
          sources at this time. We need your
          help.
          Whitacre considers the request-- a chance to be a hero.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Draft: 1/15/03 36.

                         PAISLEY
          Now you realize that by doing this,
          sometime down the line you could
          be the guy who has to testify
          against your fellow executives,
          people you've worked with now for
          years. That won't be easy.
          He looks around at the good life Whitacre has amassed.

                         SHEPARD
          I'll use my beeper to signal you
          when it's time to set up a meeting.
          Shepard gets out his beeper and hits a button- "BEEEEP."

                         SHEPARD
          When you hear this-- you call me.
          Then Shepard pulls a tape recorder out of his jacket-- a
          simple little Radio Shack Dictaphone model. He gives it to
          Whitacre.

                         PAISLEY
          You'll be risking a lot.
          Whitacre picks up the recorder. The idea of being a White
          Knight only becomes real when they hand you a sword.

          39 EXTERIOR COORS BREWERY- GOLDEN, COLORADO 39
          Whitacre, Wilson and Andreas get out of a Town Car in front
          of Coors Corporate headquarters. The Rockies loom in the
          background. The men walk toward the doors.

                         WHITACRE
          I was up in Wisconsin last week--

          campaign contribution, but I told
          them we're already at out limit.

                         ANDREAS
          You can go over the limit-- it's
          just a small fine.

                         WILSON
          That's what I was saying. If they
          want a thousand dollars-- you give
          a thousand. So what if it ends up
          costing us nine thousand after the
          fine.

                         WHITACRE
          Twelve thousand after taxes.
          The men laugh.

                         ANDREAS
          If the guy's asking you for money,
          try not giving it to him and see
          what happens. Just make sure Dad is
          behind it... Is Dad asking for them?

                         WILSON
          Yeah.

                         ANDREAS
          Okay then.

                         WHITACRE
          I'll let Howard know.
          He gets out his cell phone and begins dialing. A FEDEX
          EMPLOYEE walks by with a BUTTERFLY BANDAGE on his nose.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          There are these butterflies in
          Central America-- they have poison
          in their wings. Just enough poison
          to stop a bird heart. But, the
          birds know this somehow so they
          don't eat them...

          Whitacre's life is in danger.. .He's taking a new BMW for a
          ferocious test drive. A big shit-eating eighty-mile-an-hour
          spread across his face.

          SHEPARD (V.O.)
          .He's closely watched at work and
          there's reason to believe that ADM
          has bugged his home. He's under a
          great deal of pressure.

          The German word for "cup" is tasse,
          and saucer-- that's untertasse--
          the "undercup." What do we have--
          "cup" and "saucer." Where does that
          get you?
          Whitacre pulls into the dealership and screeches to a halt in
          front of the BMW SALESMAN. Whitacre smiles and nods.

          I think you guys hanging around has
          really scared ADM straight, too--
          word is we're going to do things by

          A pause. Shepard is confused.

          Mark, the FBI knows about these

          know-and the client leans forward
          and says, `I have the same tie as

          Whitacre nods-- his eyes water, He sighs.

                         SHEPARD (CONT'D)
          I know it's tough keeping it all
          bottled up inside, keeping it a
          secret. But, there's only one good
          choice for you. That's all there's
          ever been. There's something
          you're hiding, something you're
          keeping from us. But, the only way
          to protect yourself is to be
          completely honest.

                         WHITACRE
          Okay.
          Shepard gets another form out of his brief-case. Not a basic
          302 this time-- it's A CONFESSION.

                         SHEPARD
          You realize this document can be
          used against you in a court of law.
          Whitacre nods grimly.

                         HERNDON
          What happened with Fujiwara and the
          saboteur?
          A beat.

                         WHITACRE
          I made it up. I had to...
          Shepard and Herndon cringe on his behalf. The floodgates
          open. Shepard transcribes the confession.

          .We've had problems at the plant
          with viruses, we're way behind
          projections. Dwayne was thinking
          about shutting us down and everyone
          was on me to fix it. 'Let's just
          blame it all on Whitacre.' That's
          how it is there. It was my job they
          were talking about. We just moved
          here from Europe-they made me VP.

          I wanted to be part of the team. I
          thought it would help my
          relationship with Mick if he
          thought I would do something like
          that.

                         HERNDON
          And what about the price fixing? It
          isn't over is it? There's no "new
          attitude."

          There's been meetings all along--
          in the past three weeks even.
          Nothing's changed...

          He slides the confession across to Whitacre who nods and
          signs. He gives both agents Christmas cards and smiles.

          Whitacre aims the FERRARI into his designated parking space
          and gets out of the car.

          STEADICAM FOLLOWING WHITACRE
          He walks toward the building. As the camera arcs around to
          lead him we see that he is actually speaking out loud-- NOT
          IN VO. To nobody...

          Seven thirty A.M., Wednesday, March

          the office...
          Whitacre gets on the elevator with Terry Wilson. Whitacre's
          a little off this morning...
          s-- WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          Terrance Wilson, President of our
          corn businesses, did you speak with
          our friends in Japan?

                         TERRY WILSON
          He wasn't in.

                         WHITACRE
          I heard from Mimoto last night-- he
          is pissed. He said there's not
          going to be any peace in lysine
          until we bring production down like
          we promised.
          Theelevator doors opens.

                         TERRY WILSON
          In 92 we did exactly what we told
          them we would do in terms of
          volume. Exactly. Right now, there's
          no promise.

                         WHITACRE

          motherfucker."
          Wilson peels off into his office. Whitacre continues on
          across the open trading floor toward his office. He speaks
          under his breath to nobody-- smiling at the world.

                         WHITACRE
          That was Terry Wilson talking about
          setting volume and price levels
          with our Japanese competitor--
          Ajinomoto Corporation.
          Whitacre enters his own office--- talking to himself.

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          By the way, there was no discussion
          with Mimoto last night. That was
          all for illustration purposes only.
          I wanna make that clear- no
          discussion with Mimoto last night.
          He turns off the tape recorder.

          Whitacre paces while Herndon and Shepard listen to a tape.
          He's got three more recordings in his briefcase.

          Hey, Mark you don't really need to
          narrate the tapes for us when
          you're making them.

                         WHITACRE
          Right. Absolutely. Not a problem.

                         HERNDON
          And you can talk less.

                         WHITACRE
          I think I did on this one.
          Whitacre gives Herndon another tape and a small box.

                         SHEPARD
          Don't force the conversation.

          The equivalent of two trips to the

          walk in one day and he signs like a

          Whitacre gets out of the car and walks into the embassy.
          Shepard meets him an ushers him into a room where a phone is
          hooked up to a recorder.

          Being able to do two things at once
          is a big part of success. I try
          and do abdominal
          exercises... isometrics... even when
          I'm at a meeting. Tensing.
          Holding. And then releasing. And
          there are leg ones I do in the car.
          I'll even floss in the shower while
          the conditioner is in my hair.
          During the part where you're just
          supposed to leave it in. Those
          things can really add up to a
          significant time savings.

          Rusty the Gardener blows leaves off the driveway. Whitacre
          pulls out of the six car garage in a Lincoln Town Car. He
          yells at Rusty over the leaf blower.

                         WHITACRE
          Hey, Rusty, check this out.
          Whitacre gets out of the car and places his briefcase on the

          But, wait.
          Whitacre opens the briefcase and pulls a secret panel to
          reveal a TAPE RECORDER. He couldn't be more proud.

          That's a Nagra model number 34-A,

          custom made for me-- Mark Whitacre

          When polar bears hunt, they crouch
          down by a hole in the ice and wait
          for a seal to pop up. They keep
          one paw over their nose so that
          they blend in. Cuz' they've got
          those black noses. They'd blend in
          perfectly if not for the nose...

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          So the question is. How do they
          know their noses are black? From
          looking at other polar bears? Do
          they see their reflections in the
          water? And think, "I'd be invisible
          if not for that." That seems like
          a lot of thinking for a bear.

          have someone who sharpens them to
          perfect points like collie dog
          noses-- that's what they remind me
          of. Maybe they come from the
          factory that way. And there's
          always a plate of
          danish...danishes?-- an almond
          thing-- or a cheese danish with a

          You gotta remember we have a lot
          more capacity than we're using. We

          standing there dividing up the
          market plain as day.
          Herndon opens up the evidence bag and shows her the flip-
          chart page that Whitacre took at the end of the meeting-- a
          smoking gun.

          It could just be a proposal. All
          the other companies weren't there.
          Nobody used the word "agreement."
          I'm just telling you-- as a lawyer--
          what their lawyers are going to
          say.
          Herndon and Shepard look at Whitacre FROZEN ON THE MONITOR.
          They are discouraged.

          I don't know how much more we can
          ask of the guy.

          I'm not going to move for
          indictments with this. I need more.

          Whitacre sits with MARTY ALLISON, 35, who's voice we've heard
          on Whitacre's voice mail many times.. The two are old friends
          and co-workers-- Marty's been trying to get Mark's ear for
          some time now. They've got some business together.

                         MARTY ALLISON
          I feel like a real jerk here, but I
          need the dough.

                         WHITACRE
          Nah, we'll figure something out.

                         MARTY ALLISON
          I hope it's not a big deal, but
          I've been looking at a house and I
          need the cash back.

                         WHITACRE
          Marty, when I hired you, what did
          you want?

                         MARTY ALLISON
          Fifty grand.

                         WHITACRE
          But, I went to Wilson and told him
          you wouldn't work here for less
          than seventy-five-- and I got it.
          You were the first guy I hired.

                         MARTY ALLISON
          Mark, you've always been real
          generous with me and...
          Whitacre waves off the flattery.

                         WHITACRE
          I gotta leave town for a couple of
          days, but when I get back, here's

          We got a problem, Mark. You can't
          take our equipment to Japan. We
          have no jurisdiction.

                         WHITACRE
          So I'll take notes like in

          Well, sure, but there's something
          else I'd like you to think about.

                         WHITACRE
          Okay.

                         SHEPARD

          But, if you taped the meeting on

          tapes...

                         WHITACRE
          So you want me to make a tape.

                         HERNDON
          We're not allowed to say that. But,
          the sooner we get enough evidence,
          the sooner you can stop the taping.

          provide much help.

          And that's not all. I'd say that
          ten of the products produced by ADM
          are price fixed.

                         SHEPARD
          Ten?

                         WHITACRE
          I would estimate that for all the
          companies involved, the total extra
          profit is in the range of 800
          million to one billion dollars.
          That's just from the price-fixing.

                         SHEPARD
          Can you tell us what products?

          You know, Brian, if all these
          companies are charged, they're
          going to be paying an awful lot in
          fines. Don't you think?

                         SHEPARD
          I don't know, they might end up
          paying. But, nobody knows for sure
          how this will turn out.

                         HERNDON
          We still need to get everyone
          together making an actual agreement
          before we have a case.

                         WHITACRE
          Sure, sure I know that. But, I've
          taken a lot of risks and I need to
          think about my family.

          I never expected this investigation
          would go on as long as it has. It's
          been almost two years and I think I
          should get total immunity if I
          agree to cooperate through the end.

          I can't grant you immunity Mark,
          you know that.

          focussed the full power of the blower on it but it's not
          going anywhere. Three deer stand like statues in the yard,
          oblivious to the rain.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          We got a deer problem here.
          They're in the corn, they're eating
          the small trees, they charge into
          the road. Too many deer. Take
          away all the predators and that's
          going to happen.. .No bears, no

          And then one gets sick and they all
          get sick. Because they're broke and
          hungry and they make mistakes.
          Who's fault is that? You can't

          Oh, that. Nah, I had to take this
          physical for some life insurance
          the wife wanted. They shaved me
          for the heart thing. Itches...
          Whitacre smiles shyly and settles into the pool.

          It's not really lying when you're
          doing it to serve some greater
          purpose...I think that's what God
          would say-- it's not all cut and
          dry-- like that and you can't
          really send a lie out into the
          world on its own, you wouldn't do
          that with a child per se...A lie
          needs the company of other lies--
          and so it may look like a lot of
          lies in the end, but it's really
          just the first one that counts...

          A medium sized room overlooking the grounds. Orange Juice and
          fruit trays and an easel in the corner. The room seems a
          little cramped for the number of men assembling-- Whitacre,
          Wilson, Mimoto, Ikeda and a number of others from Asia and
          Europe. Whitacre searches for SOMETHING.

                         TERRY WILSON
          Damn Mark, can't you call and get
          us a bigger room. This is crazy.

                         WHITACRE
          Anyone seen my briefcase?

          We move to bigger room.
          They start to pack up their stuff. Whitacre panics.

                         WHITACRE
          No, no. I don't think they have
          one... . Is my brief case behind the
          flip-chart?

          Herndon enters with the BRIEF CASE-- Shepard is watching
          Whitacre on a monitor with other JUNIOR AGENTS.

          He left it in his room.

          Yeah, it's just there's more of us
          than we expected. Nothing larger?
          Really? Can you check again...

          CU ON THE PHONE BASE
          Whitacre's finger holds down the receiver switch. He's
          talking to no one. Mimoto picks up his chair and moves it
          right in front of THE LAMP/CAMERA. Another problem.

                         WHITACRE
          Call us if anything opens up. It's
          Whitacre, Mark Whitacre.
          He hangs up and crosses toward Mimoto.

                         WHITACRE
          Uh, Mr. Mimoto, I think you might
          be able to see the easel better...

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          You think Mimoto would be any
          different in my position? They
          have guys filing expense reports
          for sex trips to Bangkok at
          Ajinomoto Corporation...Any of
          these guys who have kids and found

          A suite down the hall. Shepard stares at the back of Mimoto's
          chair on the monitor. Helpless. They've come a long way to
          go back empty handed.
          Suddenly the room comes into view as Whitacre moves the chair
          from in front of THE LAMP/CAMERA.

                         WHITACRE
          (on the monitor)
          What if we just move your chair
          over here.

          sorry for those who can't play golf
          tomorrow-- we're gonna have a good

          Whitacre's POV-- he scans the room.

          TERRY WILSON WHITACRE (V.0.)
          We have an old saying at ADM It's like that game on TV
          that applies here. It's where one guy knows a word
          better to have the elephants and tries to make the other
          inside the tent pissin' out, one say it... another word for
          than outside pissin' in. "deal"...how about
          "consensus," or
          "understanding." Maybe they'd
          take "deal"-- that's like
          "agreement."..

                         MIMOTO
          Outside piss?
          Language problem again.

                         TERRY WILSON
          It's better to be part of the
          group.

                         WHITACRE
          Competitors are our friends,
          remember? Customers the enemy.
          The group nods in agreement with Whitacre's translation. JM
          SUH of Cheil Corporation takes issue with this. The two
          argue... Whitacre looks at SUH, who is LOSING HIS HAIR...

          SUH WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I want to know why Cheil Male pattern hair loss can be

          many times...
          Suh is kind of a baby-- Mimoto doesn't like him. Wilson
          steps in.

          is...
          There's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Conversation ceases.

                         WHITACRE
          We have a couple other people
          joining us I think?
          MR. CHAUDRET from EUROLYSINE is making himself a fruit plate.

          And one from the FBI?
          Whitacre freezes. He's caught. He looks at the business
          men... DO THEY ALL KNOW?

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          That's why there can't be any
          leaves on the walk. They give it
          away-Like the ants-- they can see
          a trail of ants...
          Mimoto smiles right at Whitacre-- the walls close in, and
          then, the room bursts into laughter. Whitacre gets it. He
          smiles back.

                         WHITACRE
          And seven from the Federal Trade
          Commission.
          IT'S ALL A JOKE. More laughter and more knocks. Whitacre
          goes to the door. Mimoto calls out.

          Whitacre opens the door to find HERNDON DRESSED LIKE A HOTEL

          This was left in the lobby. The

          350 grand a year, he's moving up
          the ladder and he turns informer.
          When does that happen? Is the

          somewhere with a kid that he's
          seeing on one of these business
          trips? What's his story?

          Mark, are you an idiot?

                         WHITACRE
          I'm gonna be the only one left.
          Dwayne will be gone. Mick will be
          gone. Terry will be gone. I'm
          going to be the only one who can
          run ADM.

                         GINGER
          That's totally illogical. How can
          you possibly stay there when you've
          dust taken down the company? You
          think they're going to pat you on
          the back?

                         WHITACRE
          I'm next in line.

                         GINGER
          It's the FBI, right? They're
          brainwashing you. Brian Shepard
          put these ideas in your head to
          keep you working for him.

          Whatever happens tomorrow, it may
          be in your best interest to get an
          attorney who represents your
          interests alone.
          Whitacre is confused.

          The first thing that's going to
          happen is the company lawyers are
          going to come to all the executives
          with a list of attorneys for you to
          pick from. You gotta understand,
          these attorneys are being paid by
          ADM. They don't represent you. Do
          not take one of these attorneys,
          that's when you say to them that
          you have your own attorney.

                         SHEPARD
          Tell them you've decided to
          cooperate with the government.

                         MUTCHNIK
          It's perfectly reasonable for you
          to cooperate. It happens all the
          time.

                         WHITACRE

          He searches his mind for who that might be.

          Now, Mark once this thing starts
          it's going to be intense.
          They're going to know that somebody
          was on the inside working with us.
          They're going to do almost anything
          to find out who it is.

                         WHITACRE
          You guys still think everything
          will work out okay for me at the

          No, it's true. Archer, The "A" in

          bone in 1947.

          Mutchnik.
          Mutchnik-- sharing in the joy of the success takes the phone.

           They would've believed me. Brian
           and Bob really trusted me...

          AGENT TEMPLES sits in his car outside the house on his cell
          phone.

                         AGENT TEMPLES
          I just interviewed an ADM employee,
          Kirk Schmidt...

          MUTCHNIK (O.S.)
          Yeah...

                         AGENT TEMPLES
          Schmidt knew we were coming. He
          said Whitacre told him about the
          raid days ago.

          Mutchnik hangs up the phone. One unhappy guy in the midst of
          a lot of law enforcement back-patting. He turns to Shepard
          and Herndon.

                         MUTCHNIK
          Bob, Brian-- can I talk to you guys
          for a second...

          115 INTERIOR WHITACRE'S MERCEDES BENZ SEDAN- LATER 115
          Whitacre listens to the farm report on WSOY as he heads down
          Highway 36. He turns into the HOLIDAY INN and parks next to
          the tennis courts behind the hotel-- A LITER BOTTLE OF COKE
          rolls around in the wind.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          The metric system never panned out.
          We all had rulers with inches on
          one edge and centimeters on the
          other-- I pronounced it centimiters
          instead of centimeeters-- and
          nobody ever corrected me. They

                         IT -
          just let me walk around stupid so
          I'm not really upset we never
          crossed over, although it's helpful
          in Europe. The liter bottle is the
          only thing that ever caught on,
          because it's a nicer word--liter--
          than quart.
          A sedan pulls up next to him. Herndon and Shepard climb in.

                         WHITACRE
          You guys were great. I mean you
          scared the hell out of Terry and
          you should've seen Mick and the
          lawyers.

                         SHEPARD
          That's super, Mark.

                         WHITACRE
          And the best part is, they think
          you gave me the once over.

                         HERNDON
          Did you make a tape?
          Whitacre again reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small
          tape recorder.

          Yeah, and it's good stuff. It's
          real good.
          He hands the agents the tape.

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          So, it's pretty much over now.
          Whitacre nods-- a moment to savor, until...

                         SHEPARD
          Mark, who did you tell?

                         WHITACRE
          What? What do you mean?

                         SHEPARD
          Who did you tell about the raid.
          Shepard is furious, he glares at Whitacre.

                         WHITACRE
          Hey, I had to tell my secretary. I
          told her a long time ago. I just
          said, "look I'm working with the
          FBI on some things, I may be out of
          touch for a while. That's all...
          Shepard still glares.

                         WHITACRE
          And, uh, I've probably mentioned
          Kathy Dougherty, in my division.
          She's a dear friend and a trusted
          ally. I didn't want her to be
          scared.

                         SHEPARD
          Why did you do that, Mark? Why did
          you tell Dougherty?

                         WHITACRE
          Like I said, I didn't want her to
          be scared. And I can trust her.
          Guys, I can trust her.
          Shepard glares in harder, his voice cracking.

                         SHEPARD
          Who else?

          Mmm...Kirk Schmidt. I wanted to let
          him know it was okay to talk with
          you `cuz he might not on account of
          he's loyal to me.
          Shepard explodes.

                         SHEPARD
          You could have ruined this entire
          operation. Two and a half years...
          Herndon intervenes.

                         HERNDON
          Time out. Mark, you know what you
          did was wrong in our eyes...
          Whitacre starts to speak.

                         HERNDON
          Don't...Don't. Look, we can get
          past this. But is there anything
          else we need to know? Anything?
          A beat. Whitacre regains his composure.

                         WHITACRE
          No, I can't think of anything, Bob.

          116 INTERIOR ADM LOBBY- THE NEXT MORNING 116
          Whitacre strolls through the lobby amazed at the mayhem he's
          created. Documents are being carted away by the arm load.
          Secretary's make frantic phone calls to lawyers.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Selenium deficiency in chicks
          causes reduced growth and
          pancreatic atrophy and increased
          mortality. But, does anyone here
          know that? It's in my Ph. D.
          Thesis.. .You can solve it with
          vitamin E. Mick and Terry-most
          of the people-- they don't even
          have Ph. D.'s. They wouldn't have
          the slightest idea about what
          selenium deficiency can do to a
          chick. But, I know it, I did the
          research.

          Whitacre sits in his office. From his POV he can see the
          GREAT AND POWERFUL DWAYNE ANDREAS, 70, Mick and Terry cross
          the chaotic trading area toward his office-- with them are
          two STARCHED AND SUITED OLDER MEN who can only be a LAWYERS--

          Sorry about the FBI arresting your
          son and investigating your
          company... Maybe you all should've
          listened to me.
          The smile vanishes. Is he found out?

                         DWAYNE ANDREAS
          Mark Whitacre, this is Aubrey
          Daniel.

                         AUBREY DANIEL
          Pleasure meeting you. I'm
          representing ADM in this matter.
          And this is a colleague of mine
          John Dowd. Dwayne's told me about
          your responsibilities here...

                         1 W -
          They shake hands.

                         DWAYNE ANDREAS
          Aubrey defended Lt. Calley after
          the My Lai massacre in Viet
          Nam... So this ought to be a cake
          walk for him.

                         AUBREY DANIEL
          We thought you might take some time
          and talk to John here.

                         MICK ANDREAS
          ADM's going to stand behind you on
          this, Mark. Dad and I want the key
          people to know we'll be paying
          their legal fees.

                         WHITACRE
          Great, that's great.

          Then we'll let you fellas get
          acquainted.
          Everyone leaves except for Dowd and Whitacre. Dowd gives
          Whitacre a warm, knowing look.

                         JOHN DOWD
          How you holding up, Mark?

          Sure. Anything.

                         WHITACRE
          If I tell you something are you
          allowed to say anything to Mick or
          Dwayne?

          ANGLE ON WHITACRE'S OFFICE
          From the trading floor. Dowd gets up and pulls the curtains
          shut. Through a crack in the drapes we see Whitacre and Dowd
          talk.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          It feels good to talk, to clear the
          air-- you get to be like a balloon
          after a while. A balloon looking
          for a pin to bump into and relieve
          the pressure. You could get sick
          from keeping it inside and get a
          tumor or something..I didn't ask
          for that. Why should I pay for my
          own legal fees when I'm not the one
          who started the price fixing.

          People get their live's earnings
          wiped out by these legal

          I have a friend from school who has
          a law practice and he's always
          telling me how they can't talk
          about their cases-Like in The
          Firm... You can tell them anything
          and they have to keep to themselves
          or they get in a lot of
          trouble-They're boxed. That's
          what they say, "boxed."

          119 INTERIOR ADM TRADING FLOOR- LATER 119
          A GROUP OF LAWYERS sit among boxes of pizza and beer. The
          drapes finally open in Whitacre's office. Dowd and Whitacre
          emerge. Dowd looks stunned, Whitacre solemn. Wilson, Daniel,
          Mick and the other lawyers stop what their doing and look up.

                         WHITACRE
          I need to tell you that I'm
          cooperating with the government.
          The FBI has hundreds of tapes. They
          know all about lysine. John here
          agrees I should be getting another
          lawyer.

                         JOHN DOWD
          No question about it.
          Dowd and Daniel share a knowing look. An uncomfortable
          silence follows.

                         WHITACRE
          I'm sorry for what's happened.

                         ANDREAS
          Sorry? What's that?
          Whitacre shakes Mick Andreas' hand and walks away. The men
          are all stunned, they watch him leave.

                         AUBREY DANIEL

          Whitacre crosses the room; the object of cold stares and hard

          have to take the time and look,
          there are plenty of good ones...
          But, when he looks up AUBREY DANIEL is standing there--- all
          arrogance and anger concentrated into a very intense beam of
          language.

                         AUBREY DANIEL
          Mark, we'd like you off the

          Mark, you can't be here.

                         WHITACRE
          They threw me out, Brian.

          Tossed me out of ADM. I'm out.
          Shepard backs away from Whitacre like he's a leper.

          Not here, Mark-- on the phone we
          can set something up.

                         WHITACRE

          Whitacre looks around-- all the houses have eyes. A LITTLE
          NEIGHBOR BOY has stopped playing catch with his MOTHER and
          both are now staring at Whitacre and Shepard-- as are a group
          of CITY WORKERS fixing a telephone wire.

                         SHEPARD
          If you need to talk, call me.
          Whitacre gets back in his car. Shepard watches him drive
          away-- over his shoulder we hear the phone ringing.

          Mark, we told you not to talk to an

          been-- ADM steals technology from
          the Japanese-- so I wouldn't put it
          past the Japanese to do the same
          thing. But after I told them that
          I made it up the FBI said I didn't
          have much of a choice.

          precedence-- the on-camera story we've heard before.

          A moment of reflection and then...

                         WHITACRE
          I've always thought when this was
          over there'd still be a place for
          me at ADM. I still got a lot of
          friends there.
          The lawyers look at each other.

                         EPSTEIN
          Mark, it's very important to your
          case that you not discuss it with
          anyone else. These people you work
          with, your friends, they could end
          up being witnesses. So Bob and I
          are the only people I want you to
          talk to about this from now on and
          I want you to know you can tell us
          anything.

                          WHITACRE
          They had warned me that I would
          need an attorney and told me not to
          get one tied to ADM, but they
          didn't stress it...I spent from six
          to ten that night talking to John
          Dowd the attorney from ADM. Dowd
          promised me he wouldn't tell anyone
          my role. But, the next day someone
          at ADM called me and said, "Hey,
          Dwayne told me you're the mole.
          You're the one who caused all
          this..."

                         HENKOFF

          Mark, you understand your lawyer
          has advised you not to discuss this
          matter?

                         SHEPARD
          We're not asking you.

                         WHITACRE
          Let me throw out some
          "hypotheticals." I'll talk about
          some financial situations and you
          tell me if they're wrong or how
          serious they might be, OK? For
          instance, suppose a company gave an
          executive a car, you know, a
          corporate car. But instead of
          driving it to work he drove his
          personal car and gave the company
          car to his daughter. Would that be
          a problem?

                         HERNDON
          That's it? That's the hypothetical?
          The agents try not to laugh. After what Whitacre has given
          the government-- a little undeclared perk is nothing.

                         SHEPARD
          That shouldn't be a problem.

                         WHITACRE
          What about if an executive used a
          corporate plane for personal use?

                         HERNDON
          Basically, it's the same thing.

                         SHEPARD
          There may be some IRS issues but...

                         WHITACRE

          activity involved kickbacks by
          corporate executives?

          What if the company regularly
          accepted kickbacks to executives in
          the form of cash?
          Shepard drops his fork. Hold on Shepard.

                         SHEPARD
          How much money are we talking about
          Mark?
          Whitacre pauses, clears his throat.

          Whitacre shrinks from the admission like a puppy who just
          crapped on the rug.

          how things were done at ADM. Now,
          is there anything else you're

          focusing on me getting a half-

          Whitacre, driven by his own

          been moved to an account in Grand
          Cayman with the full knowledge and
          complicity of Whitacre's FBI
          partners...
          And under...
          The DOJ lawyers stare at the table-- searching for the rest
          of their careers.

                         WHITACRE (PRE-LAP)
          The moon and the sun are up at the
          same time...

          146 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MORNING 146
          Whitacre is out with the leaf blower-- the driveway is
          spotless. The MOON is up during the day.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          I wonder if there's a name for
          that. We don't have very many
          moons compared to other planets.
          What does Jupiter have? Eleven.
          They aren't scientists-- Mick and
          Dwayne-- they don't have Ph. D.'s.,
          but I'm the one having to pull my
          kids out of school for doing the
          right thing...

          147 INTERIOR FBI SPRINGFIELD- DAY 147
          Shepard and Herndon appear before their bosses-- Paisley and
          Medford. Shepard is irate, Herndon is a little more
          circumspect.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          They need to dig deep, then they'll
          find out how high it goes-- it's
          there they just need to look and
          they'll see...

                         SHEPARD
          What are they accusing me of?
          I want the specifics? Are they
          saying I'm in cahoots with the guy?
          Medford and Paisley don't want to answer this.

                         MEDFORD
          Paragraph eight in our agreement
          with Whitacre states that his
          actions are directly attributable
          to the FBI and the US...

                         SHEPARD
          But, how could we know what he was
          doing? He came to us...

                         PAISLEY
          The question they're asking isn't
          `how could we know?' It's `why
          didn't we know?'

                         HERNDON
          The question is `were they fixing
          prices?'
          Medford and Paisley share a look.

                         MEDFORD
          The investigation has shifted from
          ADM to Whitacre.

                         SHEPARD
          Of course, ADM decides Whitacre's a
          thief as soon as they find out he's
          working for us.

                         HERNDON
          Who's counting the money over there
          if they can just lose 2.5 Million
          dollars for a few years and then
          find it in a few hours?

                         SHEPARD
          We gotta call Mark.

                         PAISLEY
          I don't want you doing that.
          Shepard and Herndon are confused.

                         MEDFORD
          We're taking you off.

                         SHEPARD
          That's it. We're done? I thought
          the FBI never hung a witness out to
          dry.

                         MEDFORD
          He's not a witness anymore--- he's a
          target.

          148 INTERIOR LAW OFFICES OF EPSTEIN, ZAIDEMAN- DAY 148
          A Sunday afternoon. Epstein and Zaideman try and get a hand
          on the scope of Whitacre's fraud. Whitacre has shoe boxes of
          receipts and bank statements.

                         WHITACRE
          I only kept a million and a half--
          and Mick knew about it, he knew
          these things went on. They taught
          me how to do it.
          Zaideman and Epstein shake their heads.

                         EPSTEIN
          You can't bullshit these people
          tomorrow. Who knows what they know?
          If we're going in there we got to
          go in with the whole story. Because
          the way it gets bad for you is if
          you tell them you're confessing and
          you don't. Then you are sorely
          screwed.
          Whitacre looks at his shoe box. He nods.

                         WHITACRE
          This is everything Jim, what I'm
          telling you here. I looked
          everywhere for the bank statements
          and the records. This is every
          penny-- I'm not gonna hide anything
          from you guys.

          149 EXTERIOR DEPT. OF JUSTICE- CHICAGO 149
          Whitacre enters the building with Epstein and Zaideman.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I was never really that good at
          chemistry in high school. So I
          kept taking it-- just to get good
          and wound up with so many chemistry
          credits I ended up going into Bio-
          Chem.

          Whitacre, Epstein and Zaideman- on the way into battle.
          Whitacre is strangely placid.

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          That's really the truth about that--
          I wanted to be a veterinarian when
          I was kid-- I raised chickens and
          rabbits ...Biochem was my advisor's
          idea...

                         WHITACRE
          Listen, I haven't been telling you
          the whole truth. I'll clear it up
          in there today.

                         ZAIDEMAN
          What?
          OH, SHIT. Epstein starts desperately hitting elevator buttons
          to stop the approaching doom.

                         EPSTEIN
          We got to get you out of here.
          But, it's too late the doors open. Whitacre steps out.

                         WHITACRE
          No. I want to tell them.
          Hold on Epstein.

          151 INTERIOR DEPT. OF JUSTICE CONFERENCE ROOM- CHICAGO 151
          Whitacre surrounded by Epstein and Zaideman who can only
          imagine which way their loose cannon will roll. Across from
          the DOJ lawyers as far as the eye can see.

                         ROBIN MANN
          Mr. Whitacre's conduct constitutes
          a breach of his agreement with the
          US government. He is no longer a
          cooperating witness.

                         EPSTEIN
          My client has given you years of
          his life, clearly he made mistakes,
          but he made your case.

                         ROBIN MANN
          We're not here to discuss the case
          against ADM.

                         I
          ED HERBST, early 50's, and MARY SPEARING, 40's, take over--
          they take no prisoners.

                         HERBST
          Mr. Whitacre, my name is Ed Herbst
          and I'm with the FBI Economic
          Crimes Unit. I'd like you to tell
          me when your criminal conduct at
          ADM began.

                         WHITACRE
          In early 1992. I learned how
          things were done there from Mick
          Andreas. He's the one who taught
          me how to use embezzlement and
          kickbacks to make money tax free.
          Epstein tries to do some damage control.

                         EPSTEIN
          My client is...

                         WHITACRE
          I know the frauds I committed are
          wrong, and I accept responsibility
          for them.

                         HERBST
          How did you receive the money?

                         WHITACRE
          Primarily by check. I deposited
          them in my bank account in Decatur.
          This seems unlikely. Spearing gets angry--

                         MARY SPEARING
          They paid kickbacks in checks?
          What company would pay kickbacks in
          checks? Come on...
          No one from the government has ever been aggressive toward
          Whitacre before-- he's thrown.

                         WHITACRE
          I don't really remember the exact
          name... something like
          AgriConsulting and Trading,
          something like that...

                         MARY SPEARING
          You don't remember the name of the
          company that paid you checks?

                         WHITACRE
          I. .I've got a lot going on in my
          life. It's hard to remember.

                         EPSTEIN
          Hey, we're coming to you guys.
          We're cooperating here and we're
          going to get the money back.
          Epstein looks at Whitacre-- this last part might be hard.

                         HERBST
          This might help your memory.
          He slides the forged ABP documents toward Whitacre.

                         WHITACRE
          Where did you get that?

                         HERBST
          These are ADM records showing the
          forging of signatures.
          Whitacre smiles and shakes his head. He sees the conspiracy
          plainly.

          WHITACRE WHITACRE (V.0.)
          See, that's how they keep Didn't these people see The
          people in the fold-- they Firm-- or read the book.
          tell you to take the money It's all there. Everything
          and then they use it against they did to me they did to
          you if you talk. It's how Tom Cruise... I'm not the one
          they control us. You gotta they should be mad at...
          realize who these people
          are...

                         MARY SPEARING
          Is there anything else you have a
          hard time remembering?
          Whitacre looks at Epstein. Epstein shakes his head "no" but
          Whitacre has other plans.

                         WHITACRE
          Umm...I have a few other things to
          tell you about.
          Epstein sighs.

                         WHITACRE
          There were some things I did in
          Mexico...

          PULL BACK FROM CONFERENCE ROOM
          As Whitacre spills his guts the lawyers look on in
          bewilderment ... The man is unhinged.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I raised white mice, too. Chickens
          and goats and white mice in little
          cages. They couldn't come in the
          house. I took care of them-- that
          was my job outside. One got in one
          time, I don't know how, and he was
          found dead by my Mother. This had
          nothing to do with anything I had
          done-- he just had died and it was
          up to me to bring him back to life.
          I wanted to do the right thing and
          wear the white hat and that's why I
          tried to make it all right so he
          wouldn't have to be dead. All the
          things I did were for that-- but I
          couldn't.

          152 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION LIVING ROOM- NIGHT 152
          Shepard, Herndon, Ginger and Whitacre. Mark looks used up--
          his hair seems to be graying around the edges. In front of
          him are a pile of newspapers-- Washington Post, WSJ, Chicago
          Tribune, etc. Each with a banner announcement of his sins.

                         HERNDON
          We can't see you anymore and if you
          call us and start to talk about it,
          we'll have to hang up...

                         SHEPARD
          You can talk to us about your
          feelings, but that's it.
          Shepard puts his coffee cup down near the newspapers.

          ANGLE ON WSJ
          7/13/95 Headline reads: YOU DIRTY RAT, SAYS DECATUR ILLINOIS-

          PEOPLE THINK MARK WHITACRE BETRAYED THEM AND ASR WHY HE

          TURNED TO THE FBI.
          Whitacre nods-- he can't play with his friends any more.

                         SHEPARD
          Mark, please understand. This
          isn't what we want. We've got no
          choice here.

          I'll tell you what, my frustration
          and anger is all coming from my
          work with you guys. I mean, this
          stuff in the papers, my kids read
          that. It's all, "Dump on Mark
          Whitacre." It's not right. I'm
          harassed by the media and Mick and
          Terry are still going to work in
          the morning.

                         SHEPARD
          Remember, Mark, we told you it was
          impossible to predict what would
          happen when the case went overt.

                         HERNDON
          And you never told us about the
          Five Million Dollars you took...
          Ginger has heard this before and can't hear it again.

                         GINGER
          He worked for you for two and a
          half years, he risked his career,
          his home.. .And now you turn your
          back on him and leave us out here.

                         WHITACRE
          Ginger...
          But the damn has burst. She sobs.

                         SHEPARD
          The reason we came today is because
          we are concerned about your and
          Mark's well being.

                         HERNDON
          It's important that you tell the
          people in Washington everything
          tomorrow-- one hundred per cent.
          Whitacre nods. Ginger seethes.

                         GINGER
          You'd have nothing without him and
          you know it. He's just been used
          by the government and then thrown
          away cuz' it's a lot easier to go
          after Mark Whitacre than anyone
          named Andreas.
          Whitacre stares at the newspapers.

          I think a lot of people would come--
          a lot of friends... and people would
          be surprised by just how many there
          are. Even folks from ADM... The news
          media would be there for sure...

          Whitacre is sitting on the bed up and dressed when the alarm
          goes off. He lies across his wife on the bed-- more like a
          child than a husband.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          .Everything would come out.
          Brian and Bob would come and I bet
          one of them would say something
          about me. Rheinhard would come up
          from Mexico. Sid or Marty would
          tell people what kind of boss I was
          and how I always brought back
          presents...

          Whitacre opens the garage door and we see the entire fleet of
          cars he has amassed-- 5 Million dollars buys a lot of
          steering wheels. Ferrari, Range Rover, Jeep, etc. Whitacre
          selects the BMW convertible. He gets in the car and puts his
          brief case in the seat next to him. He opens it and we see
          the contents: HUNDREDS OF ARTICLES ABOUT WHITACRE. A
          scrapbook from a roller coaster ride. He starts the car and
          guns the engine.

          RUSTY the gardener shows up for work. He gets out of his
          Pick-Up and kicks a few leaves off the driveway, he adds some
          chemicals to the pool and then walks toward the garage-- as
          he's fishing some keys out of his pocket he notices the sound
          of a car engine.

          in the backseat-- drenched in sweat clutching the PICTURE OF

          HIS FAMILY.

                         RUSTY

          closes it-- plays dead.
          The car is outside now. Rusty turns off the engine.
          Whitacre sighs heavily.

          Bud, pull the car back into the
          garage. Pull back in before

          Rusty pulls the car back in and turns it off. The smoke is
          still clearing.

                         RUSTY
          Jesus, Mark, what are you doing?
          Whitacre still stretched out in the backseat stares up at the

          You...You fucking God. You owe me.
          You fucking God. After everything
          I did.
          Rusty is shocked by the outburst-- this is not the guy he
          knows at all. He backs away from the car and picks up the
          garage phone.

                         RUSTY
          Ginger, can you come to the garage?

          Why? Rusty, what's wrong?

          Ginger's piercing scream comes down the phone line. Whitacre
          is fetal in the backseat-- moaning.
          Ginger and HER MOTHER come flying out of the house screaming.
          They pull Mark out of the car toward the open air as he
          stumbles, coughing, the family picture clatters across the
          garage floor. Whitacre jumps on it like a grenade.

          You never thought you'd get caught?

                         WHITACRE
          That never occurred to me. I mean,
          I look respectable. Why would they
          search me? And now they're saying I
          stole 5 Million dollars. That's
          what I've been accused of.

                         MILLER
          Did you?

                         WHITACRE
          Yeah. They were paying me 500
          grand, but it wasn't enough, I was
          spending more like eight. So, I
          took kickbacks. Like I said, it's
          just what you did if you wanted to
          be part of the gang at ADM.

                         MILLER
          Is that how it was when you were a
          kid; you wanted to be part of the
          gang?

          One time I got a brand new, top of

          everybody how much it cost.
          A beat. Then proudly.

                         WHITACRE
          It cost ninety dollars.

          FBI?

                         WHITACRE
          They approached me.
          This doesn't make much sense to Miller.

                         MILLER
          How is it that they came to you?
          Did they know about the price
          fixing?

                         WHITACRE
          This agent, Brian Shepard came to a
          number of junior executives at
          ADM... That's why they approached
          me. The price fixing hadn't even
          started yet...
          Miller is confused by this.

                         MILLER
          But, uh, if no crime was,
          then-Mark, I'd like to have you

          Mark here, but your story doesn't
          seem true. Mark is cooperating
          now.

          You're right. It's not true.

          He takes a seat across the desk from Whitacre. Whitacre
          shows him THE NIGERIAN LETTER.

          certain parties in Nigeria.
          Businessmen who had overbilled the
          government there for millions-- but
          now needed bogus invoices from
          legitimate US business men to make
          it all look above board. You put in
          ten grand you get a hundred back.

          Not until a couple years later when
          sixty minutes ran a piece on it
          showing how people had lost a

          And the kickbacks?

                         MARTY ALLISON
          He had me set up a company in
          Germany and send fake invoices.
          I'd get a check for like 200 grand
          and most of it would go back to
          Mark.

                         AGENT BASSET
          You kept the rest.

                         MARTY ALLISON
          He told me management knew about
          it. But, it seemed to me that he
          was doing the same thing to ADM,
          that the Nigerians had done to us.

          dollars from innocent people all

          the day, isn't a business meeting.
          It's a crime scene. And not only

          WHITACRE (V.O.)
          I read this study in Time magazine
          when I was at Cornell-- which is an
          Ivy league school-- and there were
          a lot of people who never believed,
          including my mother, that I would
          make it to an Ivy league school
          maybe just Ginger who I met in
          Marching Band in the 8th grade...

          ANGLE ON THE LETTER
          Fragments of the contents "This is to inform you of your
          lithium levels"..."Exacerbated by stress"..."A strict drug
          regimen..."

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          .and the study said that people
          had nice, sympathetic feelings
          about people who were adopted and
          treated them better. So I made up
          this adoption story-- and people
          did treat me better-- and when I
          got a job one of my professors told
          the people at Ralston Purina that I
          was this amazing guy that had
          accomplished all of this in spite
          of being adopted--

          letter.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          .and so it was really other
          people who spread the story not me--
          although I admit it was wrong to
          start it and everything, it was
          other people who kept it going.
          Even the people at ADM.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Grandiosity and embellishment--
          what they call it when you
          embellish things-- those are the
          major symptoms of bipolar disorder.
          And the other, the second major
          symptom is poor judgement. And
          that's something Brian Shepard
          should have known ; The bipolar
          disorder is what made me believe
          I'd be President when it was
          over... Although there was a time
          when Mick told me, on a trip to
          Nebraska, that I could be headed
          for the top.

          I appreciate the opportunity to say
          a few words, it's been a long five

          accept my punishment. That's all.

                         JUDGE BAKER
          To observe that Mr. Whitacre is the
          usual felon is a gross
          understatement. He is well
          educated, has a loving wife and
          family, is respected in the
          community. It is not inconceivable
          that in due course he may have
          become CEO of Archer Daniels

          However, the court can find no
          clear connection between Mr.
          Whitacre's bipolar disorder and the
          45 counts of criminal misconduct he
          has been charged with-- just garden
          variety greed. It is very
          difficult to tell when Mr. Whitacre
          is telling the truth...

          opportunity to apologize to Special
          Agent Brian Shepard on behalf of
          myself and my wife Ginger, he never
          hit me with a brief case or told me
          to destroy tapes. The idea to sue
          him wasn't mine-- it came from
          someone at ADM and I shouldn't have
          listened. I can't remember who.
          when I was at ADM, I lived so many
          lives, I wasn't sure who I was.
          Today, I know more who I am and
          what I really want out of life.
          I've completed three post-graduate
          degrees while in detention. A J.D.
          which is, of course, a law degree
          and another advanced degree in the
          psychology of jury selection. I
          sleep better in prison than I have
          in years. My wife has forgiven me
          and believes that the ordeal with
          ADM has brought us closer together
          in a marriage of over 20 years. I
          hope you will allow me to leave
          here, so that I can re-join my life
          with my family and three kids. . .Two
          of whom are adopted... Especially
          when you consider that thanks in
          large part to my testimony the US
          government has been able to collect
          over a billion dollars in price-
          fixing fines from big business.
          That's it. Thanks.

               BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT

               It is late night, and deserted. Engine noise approaches; 
               headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing.

               It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing -- 
               a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by with 
               it.

               We hold as another car approaches. This one is a conservative 
               sedan, whose occupant does not sing.

               INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE

               The middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt 
               and cocked bow tie. He is flushed, a Rogue forelock bouncing 
               over his forehead, and he merrily sings "Casey Jones" along 
               with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who 
               squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and 
               enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus.

               ANOTHER EMPTY STREET

               The convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and 
               approaches with its singing.

               REVERSE

               The car enters and roars away. After a beat of quiet, the 
               conservative sedan enters and recedes.

               BEACH

               We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel. The singing, 
               squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a 
               halt.

               The young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a 
               half-empty bottle of champagne.

               The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag.

                                     MAN
                         Number Seven.

               She trots away.

               The man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself. He 
               straightens his bow tie. He puffs his bounding forelock with 
               one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins 
               approvingly, and cocks a pistol-finger at his own reflection.

                                     MAN
                         Zing!

               MOTEL ROOM

               The man enters and looks around. The young woman's dress is 
               tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen.

               The man pulls an imaginary train whistle.

                                     MAN
                         Choo! Choo!...

               He looks around, in a closet, under the bed.

                                     MAN
                         I'm a locomotive, baby! I'm the Wabash 
                         cannonball! I'm a hunka-hunka 
                         burninnnnn' love! I got fire in my 
                         boiler and a fuh -- a fuh --

               He is reacting to a long leg which pokes out from behind the 
               window curtain.

               A salacious smiles spreads across his lips. He pulls on the 
               cord to draw back the curtain and reveal the young woman in 
               red panties and a bra and a saucily cocked conductor's cap.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Tickets, please.

               The man is stripping off his clothes.

                                     MAN
                         Excuse me, Miss, is this the train 
                         to Ecsssstasy?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Pull in your ears, Rexie -- you're 
                         comin' to a tunnel!

               Rex lunges at the young woman and they tumble onto the bed 
               just as --

               CRASH -- the door is kicked open and a short stocky black 
               man built like a bulldog and wearing a porkpie hat rushes 
               into the room with a video camera glued to his eye. He looks 
               like Clarence Thomas with a mustache.

                                     MAN
                         I'm gonna nail your ass!

               The young woman screams, clutching the sheets to her naked 
               bosom. Rex leaps from the bed, still clad only in his 
               chemindefer boxers, and darts around the room seeking egress.

               The man with the video charges around the room following Rex

               THE VIDEO IMAGE

               Rex is stumbling around the room in a panic, looking for his 
               clothing. The camera swish-pans back to the young woman still 
               screaming in the bed.

                                     MAN
                         I'm gonna nail your ass!!

               We swish-pan back to Rex as he bends over to pick up his 
               trousers, mooning us.

                                     MAN
                         I'm gonna nail your ass!

               PULL BACK FROM THE VIDEO IMAGE

               To reveal that we are in the detective -- Gus Petch's -- 
               office.

                                     GUS
                         I nailed his ass.

               Faintly, from the television monitor we hear screaming and 
               mayhem.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Trains...

               THE WOMAN

               Watching the monitor, MARYLIN REXROTH is a sensual beauty, 
               with intelligence and class. She watches the monitor without 
               expression.

                                     MARYLIN
                         ...I thought he'd outgrown trains.

               Gus Petch sits behind a desk.

                                     GUS
                         They never grow-up, lady. They just 
                         get tubby. Me, I've always had ample 
                         proportions. But it's all muscle -- 
                         I'm hard as a rock. I'm not on of 
                         these cream puff sit-behind-a desk 
                         private dicks; I'm an assnailer

                                     MARYLIN
                         So I see.

               Faintly, from the monitor:

                                     VOICE
                         I'm gonna nail your ass.

               We hear the Young Woman SQUEAL. Marylin reacts.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hard to believe that's the best he 
                         could do.

                                     GUS
                         Probably you're the best he could 
                         do.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh. Thank you.

                                     GUS
                         You're takin' it pretty well. I seen 
                         'em weep like they'd hired me to 
                         prove their husbands weren't fooling 
                         around. And I seen 'em celebrate. 
                         Like I just handed 'em a winning 
                         lottery ticket.

               Marylin turns her attention back to the screen.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm just enjoying the movie.

               TRACKING SHOT

               All from the perspective of a moving automobile.

               The moving shots show mansions, palm trees, boutiques; we 
               pass joggers, strolling businessmen holding cellular phones 
               to their ears, male models working as waiters at sidewalk 
               cafes, young women on roller blades who turn, smile, and 
               wave at the camera. It is la dolce vita Los Angeles style.

               THE DRIVER

               A handsome, fortyish man in a town car talks into cellular 
               phone. This is MILES MASSEY.

                         -- hello Marjory, any messages? Yeah? 
                         Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Have Wrigley look 
                         up Oliphant v. Oliphant for its 
                         relevance to the Chapman filing. She 
                         took the kids where? Tahoe? Which 
                         side of Tahoe. Great. If the cruise 
                         goes all the way around the lake, 
                         she left the state and she's in 
                         breach. She can't leave the state. 
                         Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to 
                         attach everything. Primary residence, 
                         autos, stocks...

                              (Beat)
                         Hello Ross. What? She's sleeping 
                         with the nanny? Well, you're 
                         separated. She can sleep with -- is 
                         this the one you slept with? Oh. A 
                         guy? Interesting career choice. Hmmm? 
                         Yes. I know you want her dead. 
                         Everyone in your tax bracket wants 
                         their ex wives dead.

               Rex is trying his key in the front door of his house. Finding 
               it doesn't, work he rattles the knob, then leans on the 
               doorbell.

               We hear distant chimes.

                                     REX
                         Honey! ...Honey?!

               Finally, through the intercom:

                                     MARYLIN
                         Rex. Get away from the door.

                                     REX
                         Look, Marylin, can't we have a 
                         civilized discussion about this?

                                     MARYLIN
                         We are. And it's winding down.

                                     REX
                         But Marylin, you know a divorce would 
                         ruin me right now. Everything I have -- 
                         everything we have -- is tied up in 
                         my business. The business is my entire 
                         life.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, 
                         Topeka and the Santa Fe?

                                     REX
                         Marylin?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Rex. Go away. I don't want to have 
                         to sic the dogs on you.

                                     REX
                         Dogs?

               From inside the house we hear the menacing sound of LARGE 
               DOGS BARKING.

               LETTERING

               On an interior wall; it says MASSEY, MEYERSON, SLOAN & 
               GURALNICK.

               A pull back shows that we are in a waiting room, and a 
               receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Rex Rexroth.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Mr. Massey will be right with you.

               INT. MASSEY MEYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Miles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm.

                                     MILES
                         The problem is that everyone is 
                         willing to compromise. That's the 
                         problem with the institution of 
                         marriage -- it's based on compromise. 
                         Even through its dissolution. One 
                         attorney will try to score some 
                         points, the opposition will try to 
                         impeach. The process will find an 
                         equilibrium point determined by the 
                         skill of the opposing lawyers, and 
                         then each party will walk away with 
                         their portion of the "goodies." Some 
                         say, "Life is compromise." But at 
                         Massey Myerson we believe life is 
                         struggle and the ultimate destruction 
                         of your opponent.

               The Receptionist pokes her head into the conference room.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Your eleven o'clock is here.

                         Meeting next Friday. In the meantime, 
                         I want you to consider this... Ivan 
                         the Terrible, Henry the VIII, Attila 
                         the Hun -- what did they have in

                         Rex, please.

                                     MILES
                         Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and 
                         consider this office your office, 
                         your haven, your war room -- for the 
                         duration of the campaign.

                                     REX
                         Thank you.

                                     MILES
                         Now Rex.

               He leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk, 
               makes a steeple of his fingers, and dons his look of deepest 
               concern.

                                     MILES
                         -- Tell me your troubles.

               Rex, nervous, laughs ruefully.

                                     REX
                         Jeez. Where do I start?

               Miles gives an encouraging, rueful smile in return.

                                     REX
                         ...Well, my wife has me between a 
                         rock and a hard place.

                                     MILES
                         That's her job. You have to respect 
                         that.

                                     REX
                         When I first met Marylin -- Well, we 
                         were crazy about each other. Not 
                         emotionally, of course. We just 
                         couldn't keep our hands off each 
                         other.

                                     MILES
                         Mm.

                                     REX
                         But then... But then...

               Quietly.

                                     MILES
                         Time marches on. Ardor cools.

                                     REX
                         No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly 
                         cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And 
                         very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of 
                         it out there.

                                     MILES
                         Ah.

                                     REX
                         You know what I mean when I say "it."

                                     MILES
                         Gotcha. No need to get anatomically 
                         correct with me, Rex.

                                     REX
                         Seems like there's more of it than 
                         ever before --

                                     MILES
                         Well, with the expanding global 
                         population -- Let me ask you this -- 
                         your wife. Has she pursued the 
                         opportunities which must present 
                         themselves to the "knock-out, sexy 
                         woman" you described?

                                     REX
                         I don't know. I can assume...

                                     MILES
                         Not in court you can't. Has she 
                         retained counsel?

                                     REX
                         I'm not sure.

                                     MILES
                         And your wife is aware of or has 
                         evidence of your activities?

                                     REX
                         Video.

                                     MILES
                         Mmm... And to cut to the chase, 
                         forensically speaking -- is there a 
                         pre-nup?

               Rex hangs his head.

               Miles sighs sympathetically.

                                     MILES
                         The fault, dear Brutus, is not in 
                         our stars, but in ourselves. Well, 
                         let me ask you this: what kind of 
                         settlement do you seek? What are, 
                         for you, the parameters of the 
                         possible?

                                     REX
                         That's the problem. I can't afford 
                         to give her anything.

                                     MILES
                         Nothing?

                                     REX
                         I know that sounds rough but I'm 
                         about to close on a deal to develop 
                         some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged 
                         up to my ass. If this deal goes south, 
                         I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.

                                     MILES
                         So, you propose that in spite of 
                         demonstrable infidelity on your part, 
                         your unoffending wife should be tossed 
                         out on her ear?

                                     REX
                         Well -- is that possible?

               Miles smiles at him.

               EXT. RUNNING PATH - SAN VICENTE BLVD. - MORNING

               Marylin power walks along the San Vicente Bike Path with her 
               friends SARAH SORKIN and RAMONA BARCELONA. It's early, but 
               the path is crowded with bikers, bladers, runners, power 
               walkers, wheelchair racers etc. Ramona pushes her infant in 
               a baby jogger.

                                     SARAH
                         You want to come out to the beach 
                         house tomorrow?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I didn't know Barry had a beach house.

                                     SARAH
                         Neither did I until my lawyer found 
                         it -- quite a paper trail -- he had 
                         it in the dog's name.

                                     RAMONA
                              (To Marylin)
                         So who'd you hire?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ruth Rabino.

                                     SARAH
                         She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis 
                         or a Pearlman? She definitely did a 
                         Factor.

                                     MARYLIN
                         She did a Harriman.

                                     SARAH
                         Wow.

                                     MARYLIN
                         In the words of my Private 
                         Investigator, we're going to nail 
                         his ass.

                                     RAMONA
                         I've been trying to nail George's 
                         for years, but he's very careful. 
                         I'll just keep having children. I 
                         think I'm pregnant, by the way.

                                     SARAH
                         Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.

                                     RAMONA
                         Three is not Farrow.

                                     SARAH
                         Who's Rex's guy?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles Massey.

                                     SARAH
                         Of Massey Myerson?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you know him?

                                     SARAH
                         By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey 
                         that cute little island of George's.

                                     RAMONA
                         George was so impressed he hired him 
                         when he divorced his second.

                                     SARAH
                         Muriel Rumsey.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Who's she?

                                     SARAH
                         Now? She's a night manager at 
                         McDonalds.

                                     RAMONA
                         You should have tried to get pregnant 
                         Marylin -- solidify your position.

                                     MARYLIN
                         No.

                                     RAMONA
                         You like kids.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I can't have a baby with a man I 
                         don't love... And I can't submit a 
                         child to divorce.

                                     SARAH
                         It's not so bad these days. Kids 
                         like joint custody. Two sets of toys.

                                     RAMONA
                         Maybe next time.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Maybe.

                                     SARAH
                         We do have a man for you.

                                     RAMONA
                         Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just 
                         separated from his third. He's in 
                         fish. He is fish.

                                     SARAH
                         She's keeping his name. And one of 
                         his planes. And all seven of his 
                         children

                                     RAMONA
                         And only two are hers.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Please. I'm not seeing anyone until 
                         this is over. One husband at a time.

                                     SARAH
                         I wish I had your discipline.

               A COURTROOM

               We are close on the person on the witness stand, a woman in 
               her 60's.

                                     LAWYER
                         Mrs. Guttman, you have testified 
                         that you were your husband's sexual 
                         slave for thirty-six years, ever 
                         since you were married --

                                     WITNESS
                         Except for two years when he was in 
                         the Navy, in Korea.

                                     LAWYER
                         Prior to your marriage, what was 
                         your profession?

                                     WITNESS
                         I was a hostess. For Trans-World 
                         Airlines.

                                     LAWYER
                         What is your husband's profession?

                                     WITNESS
                         He manufactures staples and industrial 
                         brad-tacks. He's very successful.

               JUMP BACK

               At the counsel's table in the foreground Miles chats, voice 
               lowered with WRIGLEY, a boyish, bespectacled junior associate. 
               Beyond them we see the woman on the witness stand continuing 
               her testimony.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Wait... He wants to give her...?

                                     MILES
                         Nothing.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         And she has...?

                                     MILES
                         Video.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         What the fuck...?

               Miles turns to Wrigley with a look of indignation. He gestures 
               to their surroundings.

                                     MILES
                         Wrigley!

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Sorry.

                                     MILES
                         Sometimes I have serious doubts about 
                         you.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I am very sorry.

                                     MILES
                         Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         No. You're not.

                                     MILES
                         I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer 
                         clerked for Scalia.

               Wrigley looks suicidal.

                                     BACKGROUND LAWYER (O.S.)
                         Couldn't you simply walk away from 
                         this abusive relationship?

                                     WOMAN
                         No, he had the videos...

                                     MILES
                         Anyway, I need a challenge. This --

               He waves dismissively at the courtroom.

                                     MILES
                         -- is not a challenge. I need 
                         something I can sink my teeth into, 
                         professionally speaking.

                                     WOMAN
                         He would invite these girls home 
                         from the staple factory to our 
                         condominium in Palm Springs. He had 
                         a device he called the Intruder.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Massey! I ask again, if you have 
                         any questions for the complainant.

                                     MILES
                         I'm sorry, your honor, I was just 
                         conferring with my associate...

               He rises.

                                     MILES
                         Now then, Mrs. Guttman. Do you know 
                         a gentleman named Morris Rudnick?

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Well, yes, Morris is my accountant.

                                     MILES
                              (sadly)
                         Accountant.

               He reaches back and Wrigley puts a manila file in his hand.

                                     MILES
                         We would like to offer these 
                         photographs into evidence...

               WAITING ROOM - MASSEY MEYSERSON

               The receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Marylin 
               and her attorney Ruth Rabinow. Ruth is a sturdy woman in her 
               late 60's. If Mrs. Guttman had gone to law school...

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Mr. Massey will see you now.

               CONFERENCE ROOM

               In the middle of the Massy Meyerson conference table is a 
               large fruit and pastry plate.

               The door swings open. Miles rises.

                                     MILES
                         ...Ruth!

               They shake hands.

                                     MILES
                         -- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. 
                         And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.

                                     MARYLIN
                         And you must be Mr. Massey.

               They appraise each other for a beat. They are impressed and, 
               they are impressive. As they settle in:

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Sadly)
                         Hello, Rex.

                                     REX
                         Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Are you alright? You lost weight.

                                     REX
                         My whole metabolism is -- off.

               Miles has been staring at Marylin. She notices this, and 
               smiles shyly. He snaps out of it.

                                     MILES
                         So, Ruth. How's Sam?

                                     RUTH
                         Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly 
                         fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.

                                     MILES
                         A yert.
                              (To Rex)
                         Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a 
                         time when most women are in Boca, 
                         having early bird specials -- she's 
                         working so her husband can be in 
                         Montana. In a yert.

                                     REX
                         What's a yert?

                                     RUTH
                              (Dryly)
                         I ran into your mother at the 
                         radiologist last week.

                                     MILES
                         What?!

                                     RUTH
                         Oh, just a routine mammogram. She 
                         said to say hello. She's going to 
                         Positano with your brother's family.

               A tight, terse smile from Miles.

                                     MILES
                         How nice.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Positano is beautiful. Remember when 
                         we were there, Rex? We stayed in the 
                         Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?

                                     REX
                         Yeah.

               They drift for a moment.

                                     RUTH
                         So, Miles. If you have a proposal, 
                         let's hear it.

                                     MILES
                         At this point my client is still 
                         prepared to consider reconciliation.

                                     RUTH
                         My client has ruled that out.

                                     MILES
                         My client is prepared to entertain 
                         an amicable dissolution of the 
                         marriage without prejudice.

                                     RUTH
                         That's delusional.

                                     MILES
                         My client proposes a thirty day 
                         cooling off period.

                                     RUTH
                         My client feels sufficiently 
                         dispassionate.

                                     MILES
                         My client asks that you not initiate 
                         proceedings pending his setting 
                         certain affairs in order.

                                     RUTH
                         Ha Ha.

                                     MILES
                              (conceding the point)
                         Heh heh.

                                     REX
                         What's so goddamn funny?

               Miles lays a hand on his arm.

                                     MILES
                         Please -- let me handle this.

               He puts the clipboard away and looks carefully at Ruth.

                                     MILES
                         -- So much for the icebreakers. 
                         What're you after, Ruth?

                                     RUTH
                         My client is prepared to settle for 
                         fifty percent of the marital assets.

                                     MILES
                         Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why 
                         not ask for a hundred percent?

                                     RUTH
                         Oh brother. Here we go.

                                     MILES
                         Why not a hundred and fifty percent?

                                     RUTH
                         Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe 
                         we're being too conservative. Seventy 
                         five percent.

               Rex winces. Rubs his stomach. Marylin leans forward and 
               whispers to him.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you need a Tagamet?

                                     REX
                         You have some?

               She removes a pack of the tablets from her purse, along with 
               several vials of prescription drugs.

                                     MARYLIN
                         These are yours.

                                     MILES
                         Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.

               She hands the pills to a grateful Rex. Their hands touch for 
               a moment.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Have you been taking your digestive 
                         enzymes?

                                     REX
                              (Contrite)
                         Sometimes I forget.

               She looks at him like a concerned parent. Miles and Ruth 
               watch the interaction.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To the attorneys)
                         I'm sorry. Where were we?

                                     RUTH
                         We were about to request the primary 
                         residence, and thirty percent of the 
                         remaining assets.

                                     MILES
                         Are you familiar with Kirshner?

                                     RUTH
                         Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner 
                         was in Kentucky.

                                     REX
                         What's Kirshner?

                                     MILES
                         Please -- let me handle this. Okay, 
                         Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your 
                         bottom line?

                                     RUTH
                         The primary residence and FORTY 
                         percent of the remaining assets. 
                         You're becoming tedious Miles.

                                     REX
                         Aren't we going in the wrong 
                         direction?

                                     MILES
                         Shhh. Please. Let me do my job.
                              (To Ruth)
                         Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten 
                         about Kirshner?

               Ruth stands and closes her attaché case.

                                     RUTH
                         See you at the preliminary.

               Miles calls to Ruth's retreating back.

                                     MILES
                         Fine. We'll eat all the pastry.

               Going through the door, Ruth doesn't react, but Marylin 
               following, glances back -- bemused, but with a trace of a 
               smile.

               Rex swallows two more tablets. He sits, looking despondent.

                                     MILES
                         I think that went as well as could 
                         be expected.

                                     REX
                         She always looked out for me.

                                     MILES
                         And she had private investigators 
                         assisting her.

                                     REX
                              (Sentimental)
                         She brought my digestive enzymes.

                                     MILES
                         In anticipation of making you sick.

                                     REX
                         Maybe I should reconsider my...

               Miles looks at him. Shakes his head, sadly.

                                     MILES
                         A superficial display of marital 
                         solicitude, and you lose your resolve? 
                         Rex. I underestimated you. But I'm 
                         your attorney, and if you choose to 
                         reward her for that mediocre charade 
                         of spousal concern...

               He shrugs, helplessly.

                                     REX
                         You're right. Screw her.

               INT. GYM - CLOSE ON

               A woman walking across a gymnasium floor. Suddenly, she's 
               assaulted by a huge, grotesquely garbed assailant. His sweats 
               barely cover his massive, overdeveloped musculature. On his 
               head, a ski mask stretches over a padded football helmet. He 
               grabs the woman, yanks her back towards him. She reacts 
               swiftly. With a ferocious "NO," she stomps on his foot, and 
               smashes him in the face. The mugger raises his hands in a 
               gesture of submission.

               APPLAUSE

               We pull back and see that we are in a Self Defense Class. 
               Two instructors, two "muggers" and ten women students all 
               wearing T-shirts with the words IMPACT-Personal Safety. 
               Marylin and Sarah sit against the wall.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't know what his game is. He 
                         dismissed every one of Ruth's 
                         proposals. And Sarah, we weren't 
                         unreasonable.

                                     SARAH
                         Well what does he want?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, 
                         but I could tell she was surprised.

                                     SARAH
                         He has a reputation for being tough.

               Marylin watches as a new "victim" begin her walk across the 
               gym.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Grinning)
                         Lilly's up.

                                     SARAH
                         Oh, God!

               The mugger emerges from his station and makes his way toward 
               the "victim." She glances over her shoulder, and at the sight 
               of the monster bearing down on her, screams and runs to the 
               exit. Marylin and Sarah giggle, but reproachful looks from 
               the other students force them to affect concerned looks.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Whispers)
                         Every week --

                                     SARAH
                         I'm dying.

               The two Instructors and the Mugger try to coax the sobbing 
               woman back into the room. They clasp her in an empathic group 
               hug.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by 
                         his intransigence. If I didn't know 
                         better, I'd swear Massey had some 
                         personal investment in my ruination.

                                     SARAH
                         So where are you now?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, if he continues to maintain 
                         this position -- we're in court.

                                     SARAH
                         Shit.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Get this! He called and invited me 
                         to dinner.

               The INSTRUCTOR, a vivacious phys ed major, approaches Marylin.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Marylin? Ready.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure.

               Marylin gets up and coolly walks to center stage, passing 
               the traumatized Lilly.

                                     SARAH
                         That's completely odd.

               Marylin begins the Victim walk. The Mugger quickly moves up 
               from the rear.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Sarah)
                         I know. That's why I accepted. Find 
                         out what's up with this clown.

               The Mugger is upon her. He grabs her hair. She stomps his 
               foot, and smoothly wheels around SMASHING him in the nose 
               with her elbow, while KNEEING HIM in the groin.

               The women Cheer.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         That was excellent, Marylin. But you 
                         forgot to yell "no."

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ah.
                              (Calmly, to the Mugger)
                         No.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ELEGANT RESTAURANT - EVENING

               Miles rises from his seat as Marylin enters.

                                     MILES
                         Mrs. Rexroth. Thank you for coming.

               The Maitre d' is pulling out a chair for her.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I have to admit. I was curious. And 
                         hungry.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Something to start? Some wine, 
                         perhaps?

               Miles glances at the wine list.

                                     MILES
                         French?
                              (She smiles)
                         Bordeaux? Hmmm. Chateau Margaux '57.

               Miles nods at the maitre d' who returns the nod and withdraws.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I assume this is on Rex?

                                     MILES
                         Isn't everything?

               Miles regards her.

                                     MILES
                         Your husband told me you were 
                         beautiful, but I was unprepared.

                                     MARYLIN
                         "Dismiss your vows, your feigned 
                         tears, your flattery, for where a 
                         heart is hard, they make no battery."

               Miles leans back, props his chin on one fist, and considers 
               her.

                                     MILES
                         Simon & Garfunkel?

               She laughs.

                                     MILES
                         Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Did you see the tape?

                                     MILES
                         Not yet.

                                     MARYLIN
                         See the tape. Then we can discuss my 
                         heart.

               A waiter appears and pour a taste of wine which Miles sips 
               and -- He nods at the waiter who pours two glasses.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your 
                         performance about this afternoon?

                                     MILES
                         What does your lawyer think?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ruth says you've been too successful, 
                         that you're bored, complacent, and 
                         you're on your way down.

                                     MILES
                         But you don't agree?

                                     MARYLIN
                         How do you know?

                                     MILES
                         Why would you be here?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I told you. I was hungry.

               FLAP a menu enters frame. It is handed to Marylin; another 
               is handed to Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I'll have the tournedos of beef. And 
                         the lady will have the same?
                              (To Marylin)
                         I assume you're a carnivore.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I know you do.

               She addresses the waiter.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Risotto with white truffles, please.

               Miles looks at her with appreciation.

                                     MILES
                         "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at 
                         first sight?"

                                     MARYLIN
                         You didn't ask me here to pick me 
                         up. You could get in trouble for 
                         that.

                                     MILES
                         Not really. You're not my client. 
                         Freedom of association. Big issue 
                         with the First Amendment fans. Want 
                         to go to Hawaii for the weekend?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Have you ever been married, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You don't believe in it.

                                     MILES
                         As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You just haven't met the right person.

                                     MILES
                         No. I haven't. Have you?

               She regards him for a moment.

                                     MARYLIN
                         All right, Miles. Let me tell you 
                         everything you THINK you know. I was 
                         married to Rex for a long time. I 
                         was an excellent wife, a partner, a 
                         lover, a hostess and a friend. There 
                         was only one thing I did wrong during 
                         the five years we were together. I 
                         got five years older. Think he should 
                         be able to ditch me for that?

                                     MILES
                         He wants a reconciliation.

                                     MARYLIN
                         See the tape. Then we can discuss 
                         reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I 
                         nailed his ass. Now I'm going to 
                         have it mounted and have my 
                         girlfriends over to throw darts at 
                         it. Then I'm getting on with my life. 
                         That's all I'm after.

                                     MILES
                         Gotcha.

                                     MARYLIN
                         What is it you're after, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking 
                         for an ass to mount.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, don't look at mine!

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Oyez. Oyez. Family court for the 
                         fifth district of Los Angeles County 
                         is now in session.

               COURT ROOM

               A large black woman in judicial robes and raiment enters 
               from behind the Solomonic Platform.

                                     CLERK
                         -- The Honorable Marva Munson 
                         presiding. All rise.

               Massey, Wrigley, and Rex Rexroth in between, rise. Rex and 
               Wrigley remain respectfully standing, facing forward, as 
               they whisper out of the side of their mouths:

                                     REX
                         Have you sat before her before?

               Wrigley considers.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         -- the judge sits. We argue. We argue 
                         before her. She sits before us.

                                     REX
                         Okay. Has she sat before you before?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         You can't sit before her. That's the 
                         rule! She sits before we argue!

               Miles glances over and hisses:

                                     MILES
                         Shut! Up!

               A GAVEL CRASHES

               LATER

               We are on a close lateral track of the jurors faces as they 
               sit, with earphones on, in the darkened courtroom, illuminated 
               by a flickering TV monitor.

               Leaking tinnily through the headsets we hear a very faint:

                                     VOICE
                         I'm gonna nail your ass.

               The track ends over at Marylin's table, where Marylin also 
               wearing headphones, looks on with studied stoicism. Ruth 
               lays a consoling hand on her shoulder.

               LATER

               Marylin Rexroth now struggles to maintain her composure on 
               the witness stand. She is modestly dressed and her attitude 
               is one of shocked, wounded innocence.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I was devastated. Of course.

                                     RUTH
                         Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Massey, any questions?

               Miles soberly rises.

                                     MILES
                         Mmmm --

               He paces, hands clasped behind his back, affecting to be 
               lost in thought.

               Marylin watches him.

               Finally Miles, still pacing, declaims:

                                     MILES
                         "Dismiss your vows, your feigned 
                         tears, your flattery, for where a 
                         heart is hard, they make no 
                         battery..."

               Marylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of startled 
               irritation. Miles stops pacing and turns to face her with a 
               faint smile.

                                     MILES
                         Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth?

               Marylin examines him with guarded eyes. Ruth sensing something 
               unscripted going on, tries to cut it off.

                                     RUTH
                         Objection, your honor!

                                     JUDGE
                         Grounds?

                                     RUTH
                         Uh... poetry recitation.

                                     MILES
                         Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, how 
                         high is that wall around your heart?

               Marylin eyes him suspiciously.

                                     RUTH
                         Your honor, this is harassment! Arid 
                         frankly it's still a little...

               She flutters one hand.

                                     RUTH
                         ...arty farty!

                                     MILES
                         Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you 
                         ever been in love?

               Marylin hesitates, gives a "what does this mean look" to 
               Ruth. She returns a "beats me."

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.

                                     MILES
                         And you've always loved him?

               Smiles slips out:

                                     MARYLIN
                         "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at 
                         first sight?"

               Miles returns a fleeting smile.

                                     MILES
                         And you hoped to spend the rest of 
                         your life with him?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. Why is that so difficult for 
                         you to understand?

               She looks at Rex with tender sorrow.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Rex was -- is -- a very appealing 
                         man. I am sorry I couldn't...
                              (Tearing up)
                         I tried my best.

               Miles almost smiles. She's good.

                                     MILES
                         That'll be all Mrs. Rexroth. Please 
                         forgive me for causing you additional 
                         anguish.
                              (To the Judge)
                         Thank you, Your Honor. No further 
                         questions.

               A Bailiff offers to help Marylin off the stand. She politely 
               and courageously declines.

                                     JUDGE
                         Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.

                                     RUTH
                         We rest, Your Honor.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Massey?

                                     MILES
                         Yes, Your honor. I call Patricia 
                         Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Patricia Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg.

               Marylin, in the process of reseating herself behind her table, 
               pauses.

               Ruth notices this and leans in.

                                     RUTH
                         Who's that?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Jesus.

               An attractive woman in her mid fifties advances to be sworn. 
               She was a beauty, but her glory days are past and she's not 
               taking it well. She looks tense and slightly hypo-manic. She 
               speaks in a breathy, giggly voice, and smiles frequently for 
               no apparent reason.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Mrs. Isenberg.

                                     PATRICIA
                         Banderas.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Mrs. Banderas, do you solemnly swear 
                         that the testimony you are about to 
                         give shall be the truth, the whole 
                         truth, and nothing but the truth so 
                         help you God?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Yes, Mr. Bailiff. I do.

                                     MILES
                         Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your 
                         relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.

                                     PATRICIA
                         We don't have much of a relationship 
                         anymore. I haven't seen her since 
                         before she married Rex. We had some 
                         very nice times prior to that. We 
                         were quite close.

                                     RUTH
                              (To Marylin)
                         Is this a lover?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Please!

                                     MILES
                         And how would you define your 
                         relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You 
                         know -- you are her...?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Mother?

                                     RUTH
                         What?!

               Marylin sighs.

                                     MILES
                         Her Mother?

               Patricia smiles coyly. Gives Marylin a silly little wave by 
               way of greeting.

                                     PATRICIA
                         Hi, Sweetie.

                                     MILES
                         Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you 
                         are frequently mistaken for sisters.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Mumbles)
                         He'll regret this.

                                     MILES
                         Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?

                                     PATRICIA
                         No. I haven't. But I've been out of 
                         town.
                              (Little girlish wave)
                         Hello, Rex. Hello there.

                                     MILES
                         You were never invited to meet your 
                         son-in-law?

                                     PATRICIA
                         No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? 
                         No. Well... no.

                                     RUTH
                         Objection, Your Honor. This isn't 
                         about Mrs. Rexroth's filial 
                         obligations.

                                     JUDGE
                         Sustained.

                                     MILES
                         Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Of course. Of course she was married. 
                         What else would she be? Single? I 
                         don't think so.

               She laughs merrily at some private joke between her and her 
               psyche.

                                     PATRICIA
                         Let me tell you something about Patty.

                                     MILES
                         Who's "Patty."

                                     PATRICIA
                         Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like 
                         mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. 
                         But she changed it after seeing "Some 
                         Like It Hot." To Marylin. After 
                         Marylin Monroe.

                                     MILES
                         I see. And what were you going to 
                         tell us about Patty slash Marylin?

                                     PATRICIA
                         When she was a tiny girl? And people 
                         asked her what she wanted to be when 
                         she grew up? She never said the usual 
                         things little girls say -- like -- 
                         nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? 
                         She always said --
                              (Very Shirley Temple)
                         "When I grow up, I want to be 
                         divorced."

               She laughs happily at the memory.

                         Divorce was her childhood aspiration?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Well, not just divorce. She used to 
                         say "I want to be divorced from some 
                         big dumb rich guy..." And I guess 
                         her dream is coming true.

                         I'm happy for you Patty

               INT. SARAH SORKIN'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

               Pasta being cooked. Salad being tossed. Wine glasses are 
               filled. It's Girl's Night at the beach.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It was like that scene in The 
                         Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is 
                         called to testify against the Family. 
                         And he's in court, and he looks into 
                         the spectators gallery, and sees his 
                         Brother. They brought the brother 
                         from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a 
                         word. He can't testify. That's what 
                         it was like seeing Pat in there. I 
                         couldn't even have Ruth cross examine 
                         her.

                         Why do you think she did it?

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Shrugs)
                         Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. 
                         Maybe they offered her money. Massey 
                         is very seductive. Who knows.

                                     RAMONA
                         Maybe they put a horse head in her 
                         bed?

                                     SARAH
                         That stinks. They left you with 
                         absolutely nothing. It makes you 
                         wonder about the entire legal system. 
                         Like Rodney King.

                                     MARYLIN
                         They bought her speech. If I was 
                         only in it for Rex's money, he 
                         shouldn't have to give me any.

                                     RAMONA
                         That doesn't make sense. It's like 
                         punishing you for being goal oriented.

                                     SARAH
                         Well, you can live here as long as 
                         you want. Do you have any plans?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Nothing specific, but I'll have my 
                         own place soon.

                                     SARAH
                         So, Marylin. Is that what you said 
                         when you were a little girl?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Probably. Every woman in my life was 
                         divorced at least twice. What was I 
                         supposed to say. Anthropologist?

                                     RAMONA
                         I begged you to have a baby!

                         In the Godfather, after the courtroom 
                         scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his 
                         veins in the bathtub.

                         is over, but it won't be mine.

                         Not this one. Not unless her HMO 
                         covers plastic surgery, which, 
                         incidentally, she does not need.

                         It's a form of botulism. I just inject 
                         it into your forehead, and it 
                         paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't 
                         raise them...

                         I was going to play golf. You were

                         Yes. Your husband did show remarkable 
                         foresight in taking those pictures. 
                         And, yes, absent a swimming pool, 
                         the presence of the pool man would 
                         appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie,

                         he who had been sleeping with the

               Slatted shades are drawn against the sun. It is dim, gloomy. 
               We can just make out the shape of an ancient man -- small, 
               hunched -- seated behind an enormous desk. A gallows shape 
               next to him is hard to make out; it is tall, rail thin and 
               fixed with a swinging, glinting appendage.

               A voice -- old, dry, rasping, lightly accented of a long-
               gone Brooklyn boyhood -- seems disembodied and sourceless, 
               as if it is the voice of the gloom itself.

                         Marylin Rexroth? When does she --

                                     VOICE
                         She's here now.

               INT. PRIVATE BATHROOM

               Miles runs his fingers through his hair, carefully examining 
               himself in the mirror. Suavely smiling.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin! How nice.

               He clears his throat, begins again with lower pitch, suave 
               smile still in place

                                     MILES
                         Marylin! How lovely, uh --

               He runs a finger across his teeth, which squeak, then puts 
               back the suave smile

                                     MILES
                         -- Marylin! What a pleasure --

               DOORWAY

               On Miles as he opens the door, suavely smiling.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin, what a pleas -- who the 
                         fuck are you?

               Facing him in the doorway is a large roughly handsome middle 
               aged man in a business suit.

               Just behind him is Marylin Rexroth, looking as coolly 
               beautiful as ever. She smoothly puts in:

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles, how nice of you to see us -- 
                         may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of 
                         Doyle Oil.

                                     DOYLE
                         I told you we know each other, baby. 
                         Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother-
                         in law. Martin Reiser?

                                     MILES
                         Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?

                                     DOYLE
                              (To Marylin)
                         After you, Doll.

               Marylin glides into the office. Seats herself on the couch. 
               Doyle sits next to her, one proprietary hand on her knee.

                                     MILES
                         And how is Mrs. Reiser?

                                     DOYLE
                         Few suicide attempts, little inpatient 
                         stint. Naturally, she misses her 
                         kids. Six weekends a year and 
                         alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh 
                         to us but -- hey -- all's fair. 
                         Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," 
                         takes her meds and goes to 
                         occupational therapy at a local 
                         sheltered workshop.

                                     MILES
                         So she's uh, flourishing?

                                     DOYLE
                         She makes felt wallets. Got one right 
                         here.

               Doyle pulls out a deranged piece of felt stuffed with money.

               Most of the contents slip to the floor.

                                     DOYLE
                         Yeah. I know. Leather would be more 
                         practical, but whatcha gonna do?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles, I know you're busy and that 
                         you charge by the hour so I'll come 
                         to the point. Howard and I are 
                         planning to marry.

               Miles is stunned.

                                     MILES
                         Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?

                                     DOYLE
                         Yep. My divorce just came through. 
                         Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a 
                         better deal! My wife still has health 
                         insurance and gets to see the 
                         children. But, I don't know. Guess 
                         I'm just a softie. After all Amanda 
                         and me were together for -- what -- 
                         you'd know better than me, Marylin. 
                         She was your best friend.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Thinks)
                         Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen 
                         and Mandy must be what -- twelve?

                                     DOYLE
                              (To Miles)
                         Here. Got pictures.

               He removes a family photo from the felt wallet. It's of Howard 
               and two fat teenagers. Apparently the former Mrs. Doyle was 
               cut out, but an ear and part of a hairdo are sill visible in 
               the shot.

                                     MILES
                         I... uh guess congratulations are in 
                         order.

                                     DOYLE
                         Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up 
                         and...

                                     MARYLIN
                         Honey, I don't think this is really 
                         relevant to...

                                     DOYLE
                         ...and one day, this sweet girl calls 
                         me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder 
                         to cry on deal. One thing leads to 
                         another and before I know it --

                                     MARYLIN
                         -- we realized we'd always been very 
                         attracted to one another.

                                     MILES
                         No!

                                     DOYLE
                         I had no idea until after, but --

               He looks at her with predatory lust.

                                     DOYLE
                         Baby. You are so HOT!

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Coy)
                         Howard!

               He pulls her close to him and plants a massive kiss on her.

                                     MILES
                         What a touching story.

                                     DOYLE
                         You know, Miles, after my wife -- 
                         wife's mastectomy -- things were 
                         never the same. This might sound 
                         cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, 
                         but...
                              (man to man)
                         I like my women with two boobs.

               Miles flashes Marylin a "you are KIDDING" look, but she 
               assiduously avoids eye contact.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Howard and I are here, Miles, because 
                         I have learned through bitter 
                         experience that when it comes to 
                         matrimonial law, you are the very 
                         best.

               Miles acknowledges this with a curt nod.

                                     MARYLIN
                         As you are well aware, my previous 
                         marriage ended with an unjustified 
                         strain on my reputation My motives 
                         were questioned. I was slandered in 
                         court.

                                     DOYLE
                         You did good, Massey!

                                     MARYLIN
                         Therefore in an effort to remove any 
                         trace of suspicion from my sweet 
                         Howard -- I wish to execute a pre-
                         nuptial agreement.

                                     DOYLE
                         And -- there's no talking her out of 
                         it. Believe me, I've tried.

                                     MARYLIN
                         They say the Massey pre-nup has never 
                         been penetrated.

                                     DOYLE
                         She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.

               He gropes her. She giggles like a teenager.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, for the love of...

                                     MARYLIN
                         That is true, isn't it Miles? Your 
                         pre-nup is the best there is?

                                     MILES
                         That is correct. Not to blow my own 
                         horn, but they devote an entire 
                         semester to it at Harvard Law.

                                     DOYLE
                         Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!

                                     MILES
                         I just want to make sure that you 
                         both --

               He eyes Marylin.

                                     MILES
                         -- understand what you're asking for 
                         here. The Massey pre-nup provides 
                         that in the event of a dissolution 
                         of the marriage for any reason, both 
                         parties shall leave it with whatever 
                         they brought in, and earned during. 
                         No one can profit from the marriage. 
                         The pre-nup protects the wealthier 
                         party.

                                     DOYLE
                         Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.

                                     MILES
                         And without it, that party is exposed -- 
                         a sitting duck. No wriggle room.

                                     DOYLE
                         A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put 
                         that in the Malibu house. Screw the 
                         screening room!

                                     MILES
                              (slightly sickened)
                         -- and we are sure...

               Eyes boring into Marylin.

                                     MILES
                         -- we are both sure that's what we 
                         want?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Absolutely.

                                     DOYLE
                         Course I can't do much "wriggling" 
                         if you tie me up like that again. 
                         Massey -- this is one bad bad little 
                         girl.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (laughing)
                         We'd better go before we get thrown 
                         out.

               ELEVATOR BANK

               Marylin and Howard wait for an elevator as Miles trots out 
               to catch them.

                                     MILES
                         Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could 
                         just borrow your charming fiancee 
                         for a moment.

                                     DOYLE
                         What part?

                                     MILES
                         I'd just like to have a word with 
                         her.

                                     DOYLE
                         Why not? I'm going to have her for a 
                         lifetime.

               Miles drags her to the side as Doyle checks his Sports Pager.

                                     MILES
                         What are you doing?

               She backs up as he tries to close the space between them.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Getting married.

                                     MILES
                         To him? He's a sick freak.

                                     MARYLIN
                         He's passionate.

                                     MILES
                         Passionate! He's a pervert. He should 
                         have to register when he moves.

                                     MARYLIN
                         All girls enjoy a little rough trade 
                         from time to time.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin! Listen to me.

                                     MARYLIN
                         No. You listen to me.
                              (Very quiet and 
                              deliberate)
                         You busted me, Miles. You left me 
                         with nothing! What did you expect me 
                         to do? Get a degree in counseling? 
                         Write a book about table linen? 
                         Because that's what wives do when 
                         they get dumped, and frankly, I'm 
                         not quite ready for that.

                                     MILES
                         But why him?

                                     MARYLIN
                         We told you. We realized we've always 
                         been in love.

               He has backed her against the wall of an alcove which shelters 
               a flowering ficus.

                                     MILES
                         The Massey pre-nup has never been 
                         pene -- successfully challenged.

                                     MARYLIN
                         So I hear. Is that all?

                                     MILES
                         No, that's not all.

               He moves to kiss her.

                                     MILES
                         You fascinate me.

               She deftly slides out of the way. Miles watches her as she 
               heads down the hall. As she gets on the elevator, Howard 
               grabs her butt with one hand, while giving Miles a high sign 
               with the other.

               INT. HOWARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Miles stares at the chessboard.

                                     MILES
                         Do you think I'm going to end up 
                         like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy 
                         bag instead of a family?

                                     KENNETH
                         Got any symptoms?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. The inability to experience 
                         pleasure.

                                     KENNETH
                         Oh. That.
                              (beat)
                         Don't waste time with your queen.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     KENNETH
                         The Center Counter Defense. The thing 
                         is not to move your queen too early.

                                     MILES
                         She can't really love that idiot, 
                         can she?

                                     KENNETH
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         Marylin Rexroth. She came into my 
                         office and signed a pre-nup with 
                         Howard Doyle.

                                     KENNETH
                         Doyle Oil?
                              (Miles nods)
                         A Massey Pre-nup?
                              (Miles nods again)
                         She loves him.

                                     MILES
                         He's the wrong man.

                                     KENNETH
                         Miles! Don't waste time with someone 
                         else's queen, either.

               EXT. A WEDDING BOWER - AKA CHUPPA

               From behind the bower, RABBI BOLENSKY emerges, strumming his 
               guitar and singing:

                                     BOLENSKY
                         Parsley sage, rosemary and thyme -- 
                         Remember me to one who lives there...

               A pullback reveals Howard D. Doyle before the altar with 
               Marylin. He is in a tuxedo and yarmulke. She is dressed in a 
               simple, Kennedy-type gown.

                                     BOLENSKY
                         -- she once was a true love of mine.

               The last arpeggiated chord rings out; birds tweet, everyone 
               sits.

               As Miles and Wrigley seat themselves, Wrigley is sniffling.

               Miles is irritated.

                                     MILES
                         What the hell is wrong with you?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I can't help it. Even with the 
                         business we're in, I -- it gets me 
                         every time. It's so -- optimistic.

                                     MILES
                         Is she going through with it?

               As the crowd quiets with the end of the song, Wrigley murmurs:

                                     WRIGLEY
                         If she's not going through with it, 
                         she's cutting it awful close.

                                     RABBI BOLENSKY
                         Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme. 
                         Ingredients. Spices. Spicy ingredients 
                         for the banquet we call -- life. 
                         Marriage is like a Great Feast. 
                         Courtship is the Appetizer. A small 
                         mixed green taste of things to come. 
                         The Early Years -- The First Course -- 
                         a carefully poached fish dish 
                         dependent on freshness and delicate 
                         handling. Or perhaps a light pasta -- 
                         a tortellini stuffed with cheese and 
                         hope.

                                     WRIGLEY
                              (Whispers, to Miles)
                         You have any gum or mints?

                                     RABBI
                         The main course -- Mature Love -- a 
                         hearty stew, cooked slowly in the 
                         oven of companionship until the meat 
                         falls off the bone. And then -- 
                         dessert. The reward for years spent 
                         together -- the sweetness of a Life 
                         Well Lived. A sorbet of grandchildren, 
                         followed by the decafe demitasse of 
                         retirement.

               There is silence, broken only by the twitter of birds and 
               the restlessness of a hungry audience.

               Finally:

                                     RABBI BOLENKSY
                         Do you Chaim David Doyle, take Marylin 
                         to be the Barbara to your Wolfgang 
                         though the lean years as well as 
                         those that are heavily marbled?

                                     DOYLE
                         I do.

                                     RABBI BOLENSKY
                         And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take 
                         Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel? 
                         The stock in your sauce?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I do.

                                     MILES
                         Argh.

               Heads turn. Miles bites a knuckle. Birds twitter.

                                     RABBI BOLENSKY
                         Then, by the power vested in me by 
                         the state of California, and as the 
                         maitre'd in the Prix Fixe Four Star 
                         Restaurant of Life, I now pronounce 
                         you -- man and wife...

               A kiss. Cheers. Applause.

               A RECEPTION ON THE GROUNDS

               Rabbi Bolensky strolls through the crowd with a heaping 
               platter of smoked salmon.

               Miles is darkly brooding as Wrigley opens a Tiffany box to 
               show him the contents.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         What do you think?

                                     MILES
                         What are they?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Berry spoons.

                                     MILES
                         Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm 
                         surprised at you. What is this? Some 
                         Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are 
                         the most cockamamie things I've ever --

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Miles -- why so angry?

               Miles sounds wistful:

                                     MILES
                         Why couldn't we be the club sandwich?

               Ding Ding -- Howard D. is tapping a knife against his wine 
               glass. The crowd quiets.

                                     DOYLE
                         Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: 
                         I have something to say to my bride.

               Howard D. turns to one side to address Marylin, taking one 
               of her hands between his paws, as she beams up at him.

                                     DOYLE
                         -- Darling, like the rabbi said... 
                         life is a banquet, A Grand Bouffe, 
                         and Marylin, darling... I just want 
                         you to know that I am IN the kitchen 
                         and I CAN STAND THE HEAT!

               Laughter from the gallery.

                                     DOYLE
                         And I'm going to start this marriage 
                         by EATING MY WORDS. Because the hot 
                         hors d'oerve of this love story is -- 
                         Pre-nup Primavera!

               He reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a piece of 
               paper.

                                     DOYLE
                         Carmine! Bring on the Pesto!

               A Caterer places a plate and a bowl of sauce in front of 
               Doyle. Marylin looks on, surprised and bemused.

                                     DOYLE
                         -- This is for you, darling.

               He starts tearing strips off the piece of paper, dipping 
               them into the sauce, and eating them. His mouth stuffed with 
               paper, Doyle repeats:

                                     DOYLE
                         -- this is for you, Darling.

               The crowd is murmuring--the murmurs grow in volume -- a 
               smattering of applause -- cheers -- more applause -- wild 
               cheers. Slowly rhythmically, Miles starts thumping his hand 
               together, nodding comprehension.

                                     MILES
                         Brilliant.

               Next to him Wrigley is puzzled.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Why is he doing that?

               Miles' hand-clapping accelerates.

                                     MILES
                         Brilliant. It's brilliant. He's eating 
                         the pre-nup.

               Wrigley's eyes widen. He looks back at Doyle eating the paper.

                                     DOYLE
                         This is for you, Darling!

               Wrigley bursts into tears.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         That's -- the most romantic thing 
                         I've ever seen -- in my LIFE!

                                     DOYLE
                         THIS IS FOR YOU, DARLING!

               LATER

               Marylin stands at the punch bowl accepting congratulations.

               Miles approaches and draws her aside.

                                     MILES
                         I'd like to offer my congratulations. 
                         That was a beautiful gesture of 
                         Howard's.

                         Howard is a beautiful person.

                                     MILES
                         Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. 
                         And I have a feeling that someday 
                         soon you'll be taking that diamond 
                         and leaving the rough.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. Miles. Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I am thrilled for you, but tell me 
                         this... How'd you get Howard to do 
                         it? I've addressed enough juries to 
                         appreciate the power of suggestion, 
                         but it seemed like he thought it was 
                         his own idea.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It was his idea. It was a gesture of 
                         love and trust. Be happy for me, 
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Well, when this goes south -- promise 
                         you'll have dinner with me?

                                     MARYLIN
                              (She holds a plate of 
                              food for him)
                         Have you tried the duck?

                                     MILES
                         I figure a couple of months. That's 
                         how long it should take for the ink 
                         on the settlement to dry.

               He takes the plate of food from her.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It has bones. Be sure to swallow 
                         one.

                                     MILES
                         Although knowing you as I do -- there 
                         will be no settlement. This time it 
                         will be complete and total 
                         annihilation.

               INT. LEAR JET COCKPIT

               A uniformed pilot and copilot are cruising the corporate jet 
               high above a vast ocean of clouds. The pilot is wearing a 
               headset. After a long moment of listening he shakes his head.

                                     PILOT
                         Jesus --

                         What --?

                                     PILOT
                         -- I've heard some -- I've heard 
                         some sick things -- in my --

                         What?!

               The pilot reaches above his head and throws a small toggle 
               switch and the cockpit is Awash with the sound of screaming, 
               laughter and music:

                                     MALE VOICE
                         Oh Casey Jones was the rounder's

                         to fame!

               INT. CABIN OF LEAR JET

               Screaming with laughter, two naked damsels in conductor's 
               caps are pushing Rex Rexroth around the cabin on a miniature 
               locomotive. He is wearing his railroad boxers and bellowing 
               "The Ballad of Casey Jones."

               BACK TO THE COCKPIT

                                     CO-PILOT
                         Who is that guy?

                                     PILOT
                         Rex Rexroth, the mini-mall king. 
                         Getting to be the richest man on the 
                         West Coast, from what they say.

               The copilot shakes his head.

                                     CO-PILOT
                         Jesus.

                         Hup! Come all you rounders if you 
                         wanna hear...

                                     CO-PILOT
                         Why're they going to Muncie?

               The pilot shrugs.

                                     PILOT
                         He's thinking of buying Indiana.

               Wrigley enters.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I'm sorry I'm late. I was having 
                         lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. 
                         Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is 
                         divorced!

                                     MILES
                              (Delighted)
                         HA!

                         ...and I hear she's richer than

                         Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. 
                         Croesus?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         She could buy and sell you ten times 
                         over.

                                     MILES
                         She deserves every penny. They pay 
                         great athletes a fortune. Well, 
                         Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the 
                         peak of her power.

               He hits the call button.

                         Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.

                         I'd stay away from her, Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I know you would, Wrigley. But would

                         I don't feel victorious Miles. I 
                         feel betrayed, abandoned and 
                         humiliated. I have pictures of him 
                         with another woman...

                         can open an erotic art gallery.

                         Did you invite me here to score some 
                         cheap laughs.

                         appreciate you --

                              (Reproachfully)
                         You really think I engineered the 
                         whole thing. You think the marriage 
                         and the divorce was part of some 
                         scheme. You came here to celebrate 
                         because you think I'm without morality 
                         or soul. You --
                              (With difficulty)
                         sound like my mother.

                         Yes, I -- well, I'm not really...

                                     MILES
                         Not hungry, huh? Neither am I.

               A long pensive moment.

               Miles reaches across the table and takes her hand. She lets 
               him. He strokes it.

               INT. CAR

               Miles drives. Marylin sits silently looking out the window.

               Miles pulls up to the huge house.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Thank you. And good-night.

               He takes her hand again.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin --

               She puts a finger to his lips.

               Sadly, Miles relinquishes her hand.

               She exits the car and walks up to the front door. Miles 
               watches her go.

               INT. BEDROOM - MASSEY MANSION

               We hear Court TV on in the background. Miles alone in bed,

               The woozy track finds the cadaverous hand at the end of the

               the arm. He's holding an assault type weapon.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't blame them for betraying me. 
                         I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my 
                         father. You see, Miles, I'm going to 
                         tell you something about me. Something 
                         you may or may not know. I suck!

               We hear the SCREECH of Tires.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (yelling at someone)
                         Screw you, asswipe!

                                     MILES
                         Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- 
                         drunk?

                                     MARYLIN
                         A little.
                              (Scream)
                         You get out of the car. That's right, 
                         Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!

                                     MILES
                         You shouldn't be driving. Where are 
                         you?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills 
                         hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in 
                         the Polo...?

                                     MILES
                         I live right near there. The 800 
                         Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- 
                         come here right now before -- just 
                         come here.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and 
                         pick up a blended for --

                                     MILES
                         No. Don't stop.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Okay Miles.

               INT. DEN - MASSEY MANSION

               Marylin sits in the den. She's had some coffee and, although 
               teary and disheveled, is no longer psychotic.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I just cried when I got home. Somehow, 
                         your disdain for me -- I'm pretty 
                         tough Miles, but I'm human. All my 
                         life people have been ascribing these 
                         terrible motives to me. I used to 
                         think they were jealous, or they 
                         didn't understand, but... I dunno. 
                         Maybe others see something in me. 
                         Something I'm not even aware of. 
                         Anyway, thank you for letting me 
                         come here. I guess I was a little 
                         drunk.

               She takes the coffee cup and has a sip. She looks like a 
               lost waif.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You have a very nice home, Miles. 
                         Very inviting.

                                     MILES
                         Thank you.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You have wonderful art. I love that 
                         lithograph. Hockney?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. I just got that, actually. It 
                         was a gift.

                                     MARYLIN
                         From a -- girlfriend.

                                     MILES
                         No. No. I don't have a... no. It was 
                         from a client.

                                     MARYLIN
                         No kidding. I'll bet you have some 
                         very grateful clients. What'd Rex 
                         buy you?

                                     MILES
                         Rex sent me two humidors full of pre-
                         Castro Cubans.

               Marylin looks at a photograph Miles has on a side table.

               A WOMAN AND TWO SMALL BOYS.

               The Woman has her arm around one of them. The other stands 
               close to her. Smiling, but awkward and tentative.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Is that you?

                                     MILES
                         Me. Yes.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh. And that is -- mom?

                                     MILES
                         Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You look like you were a very 
                         sensitive child. You have expressive 
                         eyes.

               Miles walks over to look at the picture.

                                     MILES
                         Hmmm...

                                     MARYLIN
                         And your mother was very beautiful. 
                         She must be proud of you.

                                     MILES
                         She never particularly cared for me.

                                     MARYLIN
                         She didn't love you?

                                     MILES
                         No. She loved me. She would never 
                         not love her son. She just didn't... 
                         I wasn't her "type." She said I was 
                         a very, colicky baby. You know? 
                         Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't 
                         eat well? We got off to a bad start, 
                         and she never seemed to recoup --

                                     MARYLIN
                         She held that against you?

                                     MILES
                         Apparently she was very disappointed.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Boy. Boy, oh boy.

               Marylin looks at the picture again. And yes -- you can see 
               how hesitant Miles was. Marylin is moved. A flash of something 
               genuine crosses her face.

                                     MARYLIN
                         And here I thought my mother was...

                                     MILES
                         Your mother was.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh right. You met Patricia.

               She takes a sip of coffee. Regards Miles.

                                     MARYLIN
                         We're damaged goods.

                                     MILES
                         No, we're not!

                                     MARYLIN
                         We are, Miles. You know I'm right. 
                         There's something "off" about you 
                         and me Miles. And maybe it isn't 
                         because of these women -- maybe they 
                         were just extremely insightful and 
                         recognized our "deficiencies" very 
                         early on. Maybe...

                                     MILES
                         That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch 
                         and yours is a psycho. I can't believe 
                         you're saying this, Marylin! There's 
                         nothing wrong with us. We're 
                         attractive and charismatic and 
                         successful and... I like us.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen 
                         to me. I'm sure you have a very 
                         fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm 
                         depressing.

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Thank you for the coffee. It's very 
                         robust.

               She stands. Picks up her purse. Walks over to him with an 
               outstretched hand.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Friends?

                                     MILES
                         Don't go. Stay with me for a while.

               He doesn't release her hand. Instead he draws her to him, 
               and kisses her. She kisses him. He kisses her back. She...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Mile and Marylin -- making love.

               LATER

               They are in post coital wrap.

                                     MILES
                         I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. 
                         I'm never speechless.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not 
                         used to losing control with such -- 
                         volume.

                                     MILES
                         And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- 
                         there's something I want to ask you.

                                     MARYLIN
                         What is it Miles?

                                     MILES
                         I want... I want to...

               She waits, puzzled.

                                     MILES
                         I want to be your -- your wife.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Huh?

                                     MILES
                         No... That wasn't right. I want YOU 
                         to be MY wife.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Did you just propose to me?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. I am. What else could those 
                         words mean? I believe we belong 
                         together and we can make one another 
                         happy. And we should be happy because 
                         happiness is better than the 
                         alternative which is -- just jump in 
                         any old time, Marylin. You have more 
                         experience at this than I do.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes.

                                     MILES
                         Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes, Miles. I accept.

                                     MILES
                         You do?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you want me to sleep on it?

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you want to sleep on it?

                                     MILES
                         No ma'am. I have been asleep all my 
                         life up to this moment. Marylin, 
                         will you marry me?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. Again.

               They kiss.

                                     MILES
                         I don't have a ring!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I know.

                                     MILES
                         I have a watch.

               She laughs. Kisses him.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm happy.

               Miles and Kenneth wait. Dressed in suits. Miles looks nervous.

                                     KENNETH
                         I'm happy for you, pal.

                                     MILES
                         Thanks, buddy.

                                     KENNETH
                         Is she Asian?

                                     MILES
                         Asian? No.

                                     KENNETH
                         Well... I'm still...

               Wrigley, rushes in, carrying a briefcase.

                                     MILES
                         Wrigley?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. 
                         Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         The plastic surgeon! I read about 
                         you in LA Style.

                                     MILES
                         Do you have it?

                                     KENNETH
                         I have it.

                                     MILES
                         You have the pre-nup?

                                     KENNETH
                         No. I have the ring. Was I supposed 
                         to have a pre-nup?

                                     MILES
                         No. You have the ring. Wrigley has 
                         the pre-nup.

                                     KENNETH
                         Oh. I thought maybe --
                              (He sees someone)
                         Gee!

               Marylin enters. She looks outstanding. Her friends, Sarah 
               Sorkin and Ramona Barcelona (who is now visibly pregnant) 
               accompany her.

                                     SARAH
                         Dr. Beck!

                         You know each other? Of course you 
                         do.

                                     RAMONA
                         You're Dr. Beck? I have an appointment

                                     SARAH
                         Hello Miles.

                                     RAMONA
                         Congratulations Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Hi. Hello.
                              (To Marylin)
                         Marylin. You know my young associate, 
                         Wrigley.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I do. He was at my divorce and my 
                         wedding. What would a marital related 
                         event be without Wrigley?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         It has become a tradition, hasn't 
                         it?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I loved the berry spoons.
                              (Wrigley beams)
                         I didn't have any. Thank you.

                                     MILES
                         Well, Wrigley brought something else 
                         for you today, darling.

               Wrigley pulls a sheaf of papers from the briefcase.

                                     MILES
                         This -- is the Massey Pre-nup.

               Wrigley hastily pulls a ballpoint from his pocket and clicks 
               it. Miles grabs the pre-nup, and as he turns to Marylin, his 
               tone softens.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin, you're welcome to examine 
                         it, but as you know -- it's iron 
                         clad.

                                     SARAH
                         It is. It's famous.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't 
                         get her.

                                     MILES
                         We wanted Ruth here for your 
                         protection as well --

                                     WRIGLEY
                         The Judge is here. Over here, Judge 
                         Munson.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce 
                         hearing?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. Short notice you know, but I 
                         think there's nice closure to it. 
                         Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as 
                         always.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         What's up with you two.

                                     MILES
                         We're getting married.

               Judge laughs.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         What's the gag?

                                     MILES
                         A gag? No.

               Marylin looks at the pre-nup. Then pulls Miles aside.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Excuse me, Judge Muson.

                                     JUDGE
                         You got it, Patty.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Miles)
                         You brought a pre-nup to our wedding?

                                     MILES
                         Yes.
                              (She isn't having the 
                              expected reaction)
                         It's for your protection, sweetheart. 
                         You're the one with the -- the...

                                     WRIGLEY
                         -- the coin?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. I don't want to sign this. I 
                         want this marriage to be different. 
                         Okay. Judge Munsen and Wrigley are 
                         here, but other than that...

                                     JUDGE
                         Should I go out for a smoke?

                                     MILES
                         No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, 
                         if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit 
                         from the marriage.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Sadly)
                         Oh Miles!

                                     MILES
                         What I mean is, your wealth is 
                         completely protected.

               As if a lead veil had been drawn across. She looks deep into 
               his eyes. Into his soul.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. Listen to me. You are about 
                         to become my husband. I don't want 
                         to be protected from you. I want to 
                         be protected for you.

                                     WRIGLEY
                              (Moved)
                         Ohhh...

                                     MILES
                         But?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I want this to be a marriage based 
                         on love, trust and community property. 
                         That's all I've ever wanted.

                                     SARAH
                         But Marylin, without this, you're 
                         completely exposed.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I want to be exposed.

                                     RAMONA
                         You're vulnerable.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's about time.

                                     JUDGE
                         You're a sitting duck.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Miles, with great 
                              affection)
                         Quack.

               INT. CHAPEL

               Miles and Marylin stand before the alter.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         Do you, Miles Herbert Massey of Massey 
                         Meyerson take Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth-
                         Doyle?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         "Doyle", to be your lawful wedded 
                         wife to --

                                     MILES
                         I do, yah I do, uh huh --

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         Let me finish!

               She glares at Miles.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         -- Jesus! Haven't you ever been 
                         married before?

               Chastened, Miles bows his head.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         -- To have and hold, to love and to 
                         cherish, till death do you part?

               There is a long beat, through which Miles stares at his shoes.

               Marylin looks at him.

                                     MILES
                         -- I do.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         And do you, Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth 
                         Doyle, take Miles Herbert Massey of 
                         Massey Meyerson, to be your lawful 
                         wedded husband, to have and to hold, 
                         to love and to cherish, till death 
                         do you part?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I do.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         I now pronounce you man and wife.

               Wrigley bursts into tears.

               THE MARRIED MASSEY MONTAGE

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE - MORNING

               Miles and Marylin asleep in bed. The ALARM RINGS. Miles wakes, 
               turns to his beautiful wife -- kisses her good morning.

               She gives him a sleepy Smile.

               Miles dressing for work. Marylin, in a Sabia Rosa bathrobe 
               places a tray with coffee next to him. He holds up two ties 
               for her-approval. She selects one. He puts it on.

               Miles and Marylin reading Newspapers while eating breakfast. 
               She serves him a bowl of fruit and indicates Wrigley's berry 
               spoons. They laugh heartily.

               Marylin waves good bye as Miles backs drives to the office. 
               She waves at the gardeners who blow palm fronds around the 
               lawn.

               MILES OFFICE

               He has managed to fill his credenza with pictures of married 
               life. Due to its brevity -- these pictures are uneventful, 
               the Massey's wear the same outfit in most of them.

               Miles works. He is interrupted by the voice of his SECRETARY.

                                     SECRETARY
                         I have Mrs. Massey on line one for 
                         you.

               Miles picks up.

                                     MILES
                         Mom...?

               He laughs and laughs. We hear Marylin's laughter coming 
               through the receiver.

               Miles exits a flower store with a bouquet of tulips. Marylin 
               at the doorway, greets Miles as he arrives home.

               As Miles changes into his casual after work outfit, (khakis?) 
               Marylin sits at the edge of the bed. He's telling her about 
               his day, and she is rapt with attention.

               The Massey's have a candlelit dinner of fish and pasta. The 
               tulips are in the middle of the table.

               Miles and Marylin snuggle on a couch and watch Seinfeld. 
               Miles in bed on the new Frette Linen. A few too many pillows, 
               but he's making it work. Marylin enters the bedroom in a 
               nightshirt that is the perfect combination of innocence and 
               nastiness. He puts down his book as she gets into bed with 
               him.

               They gaze at one another -- the picture of contentment and 
               impending lust.

               EXT. MASSEY MYERSON - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Miles is addressing the young associates.

                                     MILES
                         For the first time in my life, I 
                         stand before you naked... 
                         vulnerable... and in love. Love. A 
                         word matrimonial lawyers shy away 
                         from. Ironic isn't it -- that I have 
                         been frightened of this emotion which 
                         is, in a sense, the seed of my 
                         livelihood. But today, I am here to 
                         tell you: Love should cause us no 
                         fear. Love should cause us no shame. 
                         Love... is good.
                              (He lets it sink in)
                         Let me ask you a question. When our 
                         clients come to us confused, angry, 
                         hurting because their flame of love 
                         is fluttering and threatens to die -- 
                         should we seek to extinguish that 
                         flame, so that we can sift through 
                         the smoldering wreckage for our paltry 
                         reward? Or should we seek to fan 
                         this precious flame -- this most 
                         precious flame -- back to loving, 
                         roaring life?

               The young associates look confused. Wrigley raises his hand.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Extinguish?

                                     MILES
                         Should we counsel fear -- or trust? 
                         Should we seek to destroy -- or to 
                         build? Should we meet our clients' 
                         problems with cynicism -- or with 
                         love?

                                     MILES
                              (another raised hand)
                         Kramer?

                                     KRAMER
                         Build?

                                     MILES
                         The decision of course, is each of 
                         ours. For my part, I have made the 
                         leap of love, and there is no going 
                         back --

               Herb Myserson sits in the back of the room. He watches, 
               breathing heavily.

               INT. DEN - MASSEY HOUSE

               Miles and Marylin watching a cable movie crowded together on 
               the small sofa.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll 
                         move to the...

                                     MILES
                         No. Stay. I want you close to me. 
                         This couch is wrong. It's not a 
                         "married couch."

               He surveys his surroundings with a critical eye.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Honey, I could sit...

                                     MILES
                         In fact, this is not a married house -- 
                         it's a bachelor pad.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hardly. You have six bedrooms

                                     MILES
                         I know. But I've converted most of 
                         them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- 
                         a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- 
                         Honey, want you to go out, as soon 
                         as you feel up to it -- and buy 
                         married things. Woman things. 
                         Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make 
                         this your house.

               He hands her a credit card.

                                     MILES
                         Here's my card. Spend as much as you 
                         want. We get mileage.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, I suppose I could "girly" it 
                         up for you with a little Fortuny, 
                         and some passementerie --

                                     MILES
                         Good.
                              (Beat)
                         Are those foods?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Fabric and fringe.

                                     MILES
                         Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not 
                         right away -- There's a room right 
                         off the bedroom -- It would be perfect 
                         for a nursery.
                              (He takes her hands)
                         It's a walk in humidor right now -- 
                         but if I took out the refrigeration 
                         unit --

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I think a nursery should be right 
                         off the master suite. My parents put 
                         mine in the guest house. Apparently 
                         they did have a Fisher Price intercom, 
                         but my mother turned it off when I 
                         was seven months old because I was 
                         so --

               She stops him with a kiss.

                                     MILES
                         You want children, don't you?

               INT. QUATRAIN ANTIQUES - DAY

               A pricey antique store near Melrose.

                                     RAMONA
                         You said 'yes' didn't you?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I said yes.

               She picks up an antique Chinese bowl.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Is this Ming?

                                     SARAH
                         It's not Ming. It's Tong.

                                     RAMONA
                         Is Tong older than Ming?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I think Ming is older than Tong.
                              (To the Salesman 
                              hovering nearby)
                         What is this?

                                     SALESMAN
                         That is a Chinese Prayer Bowl. It's 
                         Chen dynasty.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ok. I'll take it.

               He sets it aside next to the formidable pile of loot the 
               girls have accumulated.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I can't do this anymore. Let's get 
                         some lunch.

                                     SARAH
                         What about rugs? I thought we were 
                         stopping at Mansour?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Right.

                                     SALESMAN
                              (To Marylin)
                         And will this be check or --?

               She hands him the Platinum Visa.

                                     SALESMAN
                              (Glances at it)
                         Very good, Mrs. Massey.

               He trots off with the card.

               Marylin absently fingers an antique guided candelabra.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Sigh)
                         Well. He said to "make the house 
                         mine."

                                     RAMONA
                         Oh boy. If he only knew.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yeah. I guess. You know --

                                     SARAH
                         What?

                                     MARYLIN
                         He's not what I expected. He's very -- 
                         he's so -- happy.

                                     SARAH
                         But you're going through with it?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've 
                         never been the first wife. Rex was 
                         married before me.

                                     SARAH
                         So what?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles is different. He's still so 
                         idealistic.

                                     SARAH
                         Well, that's about to change big 
                         time.

                                     MARYLIN
                         He has no cynicism or anger. For 
                         once I'm not the repository of rage 
                         at some other woman.

                                     SARAH
                         Soon, you'll have your own rage!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I guess.

               INT. FLOWER STORE - EVENING

               Miles is buying a huge bouquet of flowers. As he exits he is 
               stopped by a WOMAN. She is in her 40's but looks older.

                                     WOMAN
                         Wait. I know you.

                                     MILES
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         You're Miles Massey! You probably 
                         don't recognize me. The drugs made 
                         me put on weight and grow facial 
                         hair.

                                     MILES
                         Excuse me?

                                     WOMAN
                         You ruined my life you sonofabitch. 
                         Gimme those.

               She grabs the flowers. Pulls petal off one of the roses and 
               eats it.

                                     WOMAN
                         But my brother got you. He got you, 
                         you slimeball.

               A NURSE runs over.

                                     NURSE
                         Emily!

                                     MILES
                         What are you...
                              (To the nurse)
                         Is she yours?

                                     WOMAN
                         Howard Doyle is my brother? You know 
                         my brother, Howard Doyle. You do 
                         know my brother, don't you?

                                     NURSE
                         I'm sorry, Sir. Emily. Give the man 
                         back.

                                     MILES
                         Yes, I know Howard Doyle.

                                     WOMAN
                         He tricked you. With a phony wife 
                         and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He 
                         got you. You married Marylin, didn't 
                         you? You thought she had money. HA 
                         HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think 
                         that because of what you did to me. 
                         And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard 
                         all about it. My brother Howard Doyle 
                         got you.

               INT. RUTH RABINOW'S OFFICE

               Ruth calmly watches Miles ranting around her office.

                                     MILES
                         He divorced his wife -- he married 
                         Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- 
                         and he -- remarried his WIFE? What 
                         kind of sick --

                                     RUTH
                         Marylin was friends with Howard and 
                         Amanda Doyle. They don't like the 
                         way you operate. They helped her.

                                     MILES
                         He never ate the pre-nup, did he!

                                     RUTH
                         I have no idea what Howard Doyle 
                         eats. I'm not a damn dietician.

                                     MILES
                         Did Marylin end up with money?

                                     RUTH
                         She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask 
                         her? Anyway, I assume she signed the 
                         highly over rated Massey pre-nup.

                                     MILES
                         I don't have a pre-nup

               Miles hangs his head. Ruth sighs sympathetically.

                                     RUTH
                         ...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in 
                         our stars...

                                     MILES
                         Don't give me that crap. That's MY 
                         crap.

                                     RUTH
                         And it's good!

                                     MILES
                         I'll have you suspended. I'll have 
                         you disbarred.

                                     RUTH
                         Don't threaten me, Miles. I did 
                         nothing illegal.

                                     MILES
                         ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?

                                     RUTH
                         That's attorney client privilege.
                              (As she goes back 
                              into her work)
                         Sorry, Miles. But as a great and 
                         clever man once said, What's good 
                         for the goose --

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE - NIGHT

               Marylin greets him at the door.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hi.

                                     MILES
                         Hello Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I have a surprise for you.

                                     MILES
                         I bet.

               She brings him inside. The place has been massively 
               accessorized. Antiques, rugs, lamps and assorted tasteful 
               chatchkies. There is a new Biedermeyer couch in the den.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ta Da.

               Miles looks at it, expressionless.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You don't like it?

               He stares at her -- a very dark look.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You don't like me?

                                     MILES
                              (Flatly)
                         I love you. I want to have your baby.

                                     MARYLIN
                         What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too 
                         much?

               She retrieves all the receipts from her purse.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. I have a very good relationship 
                         with all the salesmen. I can return 
                         everything.

                                     MILES
                         Can you Marylin? Can you return the 
                         trust? Can you return the hopes? The 
                         dreams? Can you just...
                              (Bitterly)
                         SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles? You're scaring me.

                                     MILES
                              (Pulls himself together)
                         I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's 
                         chic and timeless and elegant and 
                         eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It 
                         is YOU.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Marylin is on the phone with Ruth.

                                     MARYLIN
                         But Ruth -- things have changed -- 
                         yes -- yes I understand. But you see -- 
                         I couldn't file, did I? And maybe I 
                         wasn't going to file. Maybe -- maybe 
                         Ruth -- Yes. Okay.

               OUTSIDE BEDROOM - MASSEY HOUSE - NIGHT

               The bedroom door is closed. Marylin knocks repeatedly.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles? Open the door, Miles. Please 
                         open the door. I want to talk to 
                         you. Miles? I'm coming in. Here I 
                         come.

               She pushes the door open. No Miles in sight. On the bed, 
               scrawled on a piece of mMm stationery, taped to one of the 
               mMm Frette pillows -- a note which reads -- "If you prick 
               us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If 
               you poison us, do we not die? AND IF YOU WRONG US SHALL WE 
               NOT REVENGE?"

               INT. KENNETH'S HOUSE

               Kenneth stares at the chessboard. Court TV is on the 
               background.

               TV SCREEN

               COURT TV REPORTER

               We are back at the Trial of New Jersey v. Medrano. Mr. Medrano 
               is accused of killing his wife, Alicia in 1992. He claims it 
               was suicide. Let's return to the courtroom.

               See the action in the courtroom --

               The Prosecutor shows the jury an extremely large handgun.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         How far would this gun have to be in 
                         order to inflict a wound without 
                         leaving powder burns on the scalp.

                                     EXPERT WITNESS
                         Approximately three feet.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         And how could Mrs. Medrano shoot 
                         herself in the back of the head from 
                         a distance of three feet?

                                     KENNETH
                         Really long arms?

               He moves a piece.

                                     MILES
                         They won't get a conviction. The 
                         husband called it in as a suicide. 
                         The forensic guys weren't thinking 
                         murder. I'm sure some of the evidence 
                         was compromised.

                                     KENNETH
                         It's your move, Miles.

                                     MILES
                              (Sadly)
                         I already made my move, Kenneth.

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE

               A private yoga class. Marylin, Sarah and Ramona are in the 
               plow position. The yuppie Sikh instructor places his weight 
               on Sarah.

                                     SARAH
                         Vishu! Knock it off. That hurts.

                                     VISHNU
                         Breathe through it.

               Sarah tries a few deep breaths. Marylin concentrates hard.

                                     VISHNU
                         That's good, Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't even know where he is. He 
                         looked so devastated. If I could 
                         just talk to him for a few minutes.

               SFX DOORBELL

                                     MARYLIN
                         Was that the bell?

                                     RAMONA
                         It sounded like a bell.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'll be right back.

               INT. HALLWAY - MASSEY HOUSE

               Marylin walks to the door. Opens it. Two POLICE OFFICERS.

                         We have a warrant for your arrest.

               Marylin is photographed front and profile. She is finger 
               printed; she is searched and relieved of her jewelry; and 
               finally, she is throw into a holding tank with several other 
               women -- trapped. She clings despondently to the bars.

                         You can go now, Mrs. Massey. Someone 
                         made bail.

               Marylin exits.

               INT. RUTH'S CAR

               Marylin sits next to Ruth.

                         Forgery and Fraud?

                                     RUTH
                         You used his credit card.

                                     MARYLIN
                         He told me to -- he said he wanted 
                         me to --

                                     RUTH
                         Quite a little shopping spree. How 
                         do you spend six figures in less 
                         than six hours? Oh, never mind I've 
                         seen it before. I've seen everything.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you think he set me up? Do you 
                         think that was his intention?

                                     RUTH
                         Like I know his intention? Or yours 
                         for that matter?
                              (Sighs)
                         I should join Sam. I'm too old for 
                         this bullshit.

                         He never even asked. He just assumed --

                                     RUTH
                         He was right, wasn't he?

                                     MARYLIN
                         So. Now what?

                                     RUTH
                         Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a 
                         deal or find out how Jean Harris 
                         made it work for her.

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE - DAY

               Miles opens the door. Marylin is standing there.

                                     MILES
                         Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!

                                     MARYLIN
                         May I come in?

                                     MILES
                         I don't know. Maybe I should grab my 
                         mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have 
                         little experience with "the criminal 
                         mind."

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'd just like to pick up a few of my 
                         things

                                     MILES
                         I don't believe you have "things."

                                     MARYLIN
                         On the contrary. We're married and 
                         we have no pre-nup, so a case could 
                         be made that everything in here is 
                         mine.

               Marylin walks into the den. Sits on the new sofa.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Comfy!

                                     MILES
                         What do you want?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I want to nail you ass.

                                     MILES
                         Are you threatening me, because I'm 
                         sure that's a violation of the terms 
                         of your bail.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm reporting you to the IRS.

                                     MILES
                         The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting 
                         a refund.

               He laughs. She looks at him, dead serious.

                                     MILES
                         I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported 
                         every dollar I've ever made. Try 
                         again, girlfriend.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm not talking about dollars, 
                         studmuffin. I'm talking about --

               She opens a humidor and takes out a Cigar.

                                     MARYLIN
                         STUFF.

                         Got a light?

                                     MILES
                         What kind of "stuff?"

               She reaches into her purse. Pulls out a Dunhill and expertly 
               lights the cigar.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Arty Farty stuff.

                         Watches and mileage on private jets. 
                         Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from 
                         grateful clients.

                                     MILES
                         Those are gifts.

                                     MARYLIN

                                     MILES
                         You can't prove anything.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't have to. That's what the IRS 
                         guys do. And they do it with great 
                         zeal. See, they work at these tortuous 
                         civil service jobs, and when five 
                         hundred dollar an hour boys like you 
                         take their trade out in luxury 
                         goodies, these saps feel.. well, 
                         they feel like saps. And they feel 
                         bitter and they feel vengeful and 
                         they feel WRATH.
                              (Puffing on the cigar)
                         What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?

                                     MILES
                         You're out of your league, Marylin. 
                         Rexroth was a primate. I'm a 
                         professional.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I know. So am I, right? And so is 
                         Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue 
                         Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid 
                         graduate of Southwestern University -- 
                         very tenacious, and never more so 
                         than when he's dealing with an 
                         unscrupulous colleague.
                              (She stands to leave)
                         I think it's only fair to warn you: 
                         I'm going to file an action, Miles. 
                         And after a decent interval I plan 
                         to have Ruth seek an injunction that 
                         will forbid your approach within 500 
                         feet of my house.

                                     MILES
                         Meaning my house.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I believe the residence will be part 
                         of the settlement.

                                     MILES
                         Did our marriage ever mean anything 
                         to you?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Drop the bogus forgery charge and 
                         I'll forget about your generous 
                         friends slash clients.

                                     MILES
                         That's blackmail.

                                     MARYLIN
                         That's marriage.

               She gives him a peck on the cheek. As she leaves:

                                     MARYLIN
                         You'll always be my favorite husband.

               Miles sits dejectedly on the new sofa looking at the 
               paintings. He looks at the watch. And the cigars. And the 
               picture of his mother.

                                     MILES
                         Pity you can't be here. You'd enjoy 
                         this.

               CLOSE ON A BAG OF FLUIDS

               We pull back from the milky yellowish bag of fluid to show 
               that a nurse is unhooking and removing it from under Herb 
               Meyerson's wheelchair where it collects drainage.

               She now places it up on the IV gantry and connects, and swaps 
               the now empty drip under the wheelchair to collect drainage. 
               We are once again in Herb Meyerson's gloomy office, its 
               venetians blocking most of the light and making Herb a dark, 
               enigmatic figure.

                                     HERB
                         This woman has humbled, shamed and 
                         disgrazed the entire foim.

               A reverse shows Miles standing in front of Herb's desk.

                                     MILES
                         Yes Herb,

                         to the music..

               He waves his free arm to the beat of music unheard.

                                     HERB
                         -- of the hoidy-goidy.

                                     MILES
                         I understand Herb... I just... for 
                         the first time in my career -- I 
                         don't know what to do. I'm a patsy. 
                         A sitting duck. I'm lost.

                                     HERB
                         Lost! I'll tell you what you can do, 
                         you can --

               He brings himself up short and turns to the nurse.

                                     HERB
                         -- leave us.

               She heads for the door.

                                     HERB
                         -- You can act like a man. Let me 
                         tell you sumpn, smart guy. You tawt

                         gonna talk to you about the goddamn 
                         LAW.

               He climbs unsteadily to his feet and tries to pace, 
               gesticulating, with the IV swaying dangerously behind him.

                                     HERB
                         -- We SOIVE THE LAW! We HONUH the

                         counseluh, we OBEY THE LAW --

               He pauses to let this sink in.

                                     HERB
                         -- but conseluh -- This is not one a

               CLOSE ON

               An edgy looking gangster, JOE. He is perspiring heavily. He 
               breathes through his mouth with the rasping wheeze of an 
               asthmatic.

               His labored breath rattles as he stares across the table at 
               someone off. At length, a voice:

                                     VOICE
                         ...Are you Joe?

               Still staring, but perhaps by way of answer, the gangster 
               raises an inhaler, sticks it in his mouth, and squeezes. 
               WHUSH.

                         Who do you want me to kill?

                                     MILES
                         Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. 
                         Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, 
                         neutralize a, uh, business associate 
                         by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle 
                         Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.

                                     GANGSTER
                         Is that... one person?

                                     MILES
                         Here's her picture...

               He is shoving an envelope across the table.

                                     MILES
                         ...and the address where she's 
                         staying. It's the residence of a Mr. 
                         Massey. Uh, Dumbarton. Massey. Uh, 
                         it's not Mr. Dumbarton's house. Though 
                         he's not involved. And because of an 
                         impending legal action this needs to 
                         happen within a certain... time frame. 
                         Uh... on an expedited basis.

               The gangster stares expressionlessly. He raises the inhaler 
               again and, with his eyes still on Miles, squeezes. WHUSH.

                                     GANGSTER
                         You're in a rush.

                                     MILES
                         Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.

               A long beat. Finally, Miles explodes

                                     MILES
                         She won't suffer, will she?

               He bites a knuckle, gazing fearfully at the gangster. The 
               gangster stares impassively back.

                                     GANGSTER
                         ...not unless you pay extra.

               INT. REX REXROTH MANSION

               An enormous oak paneled room. Furnished with chairs sofas 
               and a huge circular bed. A fire roars in the far corner. On 
               the wall above the bed a film loop is being projected -- 
               soft core pornographic images.

               On the bed, Rex is surrounded by three naked beauties, smeared 
               in cola dust and wearing conductor caps.

                                     REX
                         I've been working on the railroad --

                                     TARTS
                         All the livelong day!

                                     REX
                         I've been working on the railroad

                                     TARTS
                         Just to pass the time away!

                                     REX
                         Can'tcha hear the whistle... the 
                         whistle... AWWWWWWW.

               Rex hunches over, clutching his left arm.

               One by one, the girls stop dancing and stare. There is a 
               somber silence, broken by another.

                                     REX
                         Awwwwwww --

               The girls are all watching now. One of them steps forward.

                                     TART
                         -- Whatsa matter, Rexie?

               INT. KENNETH'S HOUSE

               A guest room. Dark, dirty and filled with empty bottles of 
               expensive French wine.

               We hear a phone ringing in a different room. It rings several 
               times.

               The figure on the bed stirs, rolls over, moans, clamps a 
               pillow over his head.

               The ring of the distant telephone is interrupted and we hear 
               a muffled voice:

                                     VOICE
                         Hello. Yes, he's here. Just a minute --

               We hear approaching footsteps and Kenneth enters the 
               background, knotting a bathrobe. He turns on the light in 
               the room.

                                     KENNETH
                         Miles. It's for you.

               The figure on the couch pulls away the pillow. It is indeed 
               Miles Massey. He blearily takes the offered phone.

                                     MILES
                         Hello. Yes -- what?! Yes -- I see --

               After another listening beat he drops the phone away. He 
               remains staring dully out into space.

                                     MILES
                         My God.

                                     KENNETH
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         That was Marvin Untermeyer.

                                     KENNETH
                         Yes?

                                     MILES
                         He was Rex Rexroth's personal 
                         attorney.

                                     KENNETH
                         What do you mean, was.

                                     MILES
                         Rex just had a massive coronary. In 
                         the middle of a business meeting. 
                         He's dead.

               Kenneth is mildly puzzled.

                                     KENNETH
                         I'm sorry to hear that. But you 
                         weren't close, were you?

                                     MILES
                         Marvin says that Rex's will is four 
                         years old. He never redrafted it.

                                     KENNETH
                         Yes.

               Miles voice is still flat, expressionless:

                                     MILES
                         Everything goes to Marylin.

               He looks up a at Kenneth.

                                     MILES
                         She's rich. We're still married. We 
                         have no pre-nup.

                                     KENNETH
                         So, that's good, right?

               MINUTES LATER

               Miles paces with the telephone. He punches numbers with the 
               thumb of the hand holding the phone; his other hand holds a 
               coffee cup from which he takes trembling slurps.

                                     VOICE
                         This is Joe. Wuddya need?

               Then a beep.

                                     MILES
                         Joe. This is Mr. uh... friend of -- 
                         we met. This is to instruct you it's 
                         No Go! Do you understand me?! NO GO 
                         on Marylin Rexroth Doyle -- No Go.

               He slams down the phone.

                                     KENNETH
                         Who was that?

                                     MILES
                         That was -- oh, shit. What if he's 
                         on his way over there?

                                     KENNETH
                         Huh?

               Consumed with remorse, Miles moans.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin! What have I done?

                                     KENNETH
                         I don't know, but don't call me 
                         Marylin.

               MILES CAR

               Miles drives, speeding, taking corners hard while punching 
               numbers into his car phone.

                                     MILES
                         Get her out, buy some time; get her 
                         out --

               INT. MASSEY MANSION - NIGHT

               In the bedroom, the phone starts ringing. A hand enters to 
               pick it up. We follow the hand up to reveal

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hello?

               MILES SPEEDING CAR

                                     MILES
                         Marylin?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles? Miles! Where have you been? 
                         I've been trying to get in touch.

                                     MILES
                         You have to leave the house 
                         immediately!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I will, Miles. I will leave. But 
                         Miles --

                                     MILES
                         No buts. Now. Out.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. 
                         It's true that my initial intention 
                         was to...

                                     MILES
                         Please! Leave the house.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I fell in love Miles.

                                     MILES
                         So did I. Now pack up a few basics 
                         and --

                                     MARYLIN
                         You do? You do love me?

               MASSEY MANSION

               Marylin hangs up the phone.

               She walks slowly around the room, pausing at the mantelpiece 
               to pick up a framed picture of Miles, which she 
               contemplatively regards.

               We pan with her continued walk to bring Joe into frame. He 
               stands with his back pressed to the wall. She's started for 
               a moment, but quickly recoups:

                                     MARYLIN
                         Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.

                                     JOE
                         Mr. Dumbarton.

               She shows him the picture of Miles.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Is this Mr. Dumbarton?

                                     JOE
                         No...

               She cocks an eye at him.

                                     JOE
                         That's his lawyer.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Triple!

                                     JOE
                         Who's the pigeon?

               We faintly hear a car screeching to a halt.

               EXT. MASSEY MANSION

               Massey exits the car. He clutches a can of mace.

               INT. MANSION

               We hear a key scrape in the lock. The front door swings open 
               onto a dark foyer as Miles tiptoes in.

                                     MILES
                              (Whispers)
                         Marylin?

               DINING ROOM

               Miles tiptoes through, looking warily about. He backs through 
               the swinging doors connecting to the kitchen. Finds himself 
               face to face with Joe.

                                     MILES
                         Joe! Thank God you're in time. You're 
                         not in time. I'm in time. Thank God 
                         I'm in time.

               Joe stares at him.

                                     MILES
                         It's a no go! Get it? No one any the 
                         wiser. Okay!

               He makes a cow-herding motion with his hands.

                                     MILES
                         You can go home now! Goodbye! Thanks 
                         so much!

               Joe takes out his gun.

                                     MILES
                         No no! No contract! It's all over.

               This has no effect on Joe who is unscrewing his silencer.

               Miles is exasperated. Suddenly -- Marylin appears.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's a no go, Joe.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin!

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's okay Joe.

               Joe glances at both of them with barely concealed contempt.

                                     MILES
                         Wait! He works for YOU?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Now. But first, he worked for you.

                                     MILES
                         You were going to have this thug...?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Wait just a second there. You sent 
                         him here. You unearthed this 
                         pestilence.

                                     JOE
                         You're calling me a pestilence? That's 
                         a hoot!

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Joe)
                         I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- 
                         but, we changed our minds.
                              (To Miles)
                         Did you really mean what you said on 
                         the phone. It wasn't because you 
                         found out about Rex?

                                     MILES
                         Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. 
                         I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No 
                         matter what happened to you.

                                     MARYLIN
                         That's true.

                                     JOE
                         Lemme tell you something. You are 
                         the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay 
                         you the twenty thousand.

                                     MILES
                         It was fifty for you.

                                     JOE
                              (To Miles)
                         That's cause you're a lawyer. I gave 
                         her the lawyer discount.
                              (Looks at Marylin)
                         But I shouldn't of. Cause you're a 
                         whore. A whore who worships the 
                         dollar.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, actually, all whores worship 
                         the dollar, if you want to get 
                         technical.

                                     JOE
                         Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like 
                         you. And my clients? Whores just 
                         like you.

                                     MILES
                         Were you with a firm?

                                     JOE
                         Kaplan.

                                     MILES
                         Kaplan? I know Kaplan. Wait. You're 
                         Joe Gittelson? I knew you looked -- 
                         You were great -- we studied you.

                                     JOE
                         Twenty years in "matrimonial law" 
                         and it made me sick.
                              (He wheezes)
                         I broke up homes and families, never 
                         givin' it a second thought. Till one 
                         day. I had an epiphany. You know 
                         what that is?
                              (They nod)
                         Came with a damn stigmata if you can 
                         believe that! I said to myself -- 
                         Joe -- everyone you see wants blood. 
                         Everyone wants their ex's dead. So 
                         why jerk around with rest. You wanna 
                         best serve your clients? Kill em.

               Joe is raising the gun at Miles. Miles sprays him with Mace.

               BANG -- Joe fires blindly, scrunching his eyes against the 
               chemical, sucking for breath like a jet engine revving for a 
               take-off.

               SLAM -- Marylin elbows him in the face, breaking his nose. 
               She finishes with a solid groin kick. It slows him down, but 
               doesn't stop him.

               Joe stumbles a bit, but regains his footing.

               BANG -- Joe is rampaging around the room, still firing, 
               thumping at his chest with his free hand for his inhaler. 
               Marylin runs to Miles. He takes her hand and they run toward 
               the door, seeking egress.

               BANG -- still firing, he pulls out the inhaler but blindly 
               bobbles it.

               Joe reaches with his gun hand to keep the inhaler from 
               falling. He momentarily bobbles both gun and inhaler.

               Miles pops up in front of him.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm not leaving you. I took self 
                         defense

               Joe recovers and raises the gun to his mouth as he points 
               the inhaler at Miles.

               He squeezes -- WHUSH -- Miles squints against the asthma 
               mist and lets out a horrified:

                                     MILES
                         Joe!

               BANG! The off-screen gunshot is followed by the sound of a 
               body dropping heavily to the floor.

               Silence.

               Marylin runs over to Miles. They look sadly down at the floor.

                                     MILES
                         WE told him it was no go...

               INT. MASSEY MYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Wrigley sits bouncing the steepled fingers of one hand against 
               the other.

               Miles sits gazing sadly out the window.

               The room is empty.

               There is the whir of ventilation.

               The click of the door attracts both their attention and brings 
               them to their feet.

               Marylin walks in, chic and beautiful as ever, followed by 
               Ruth, who sits next to her, places her attaché case on the 
               table top, and snaps its clasps.

                                     RUTH
                         Alright.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Ruth.

               Miles and Marylin are looking at each other. Quietly:

                                     MILES
                         Hello Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hello Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Hard to believe this is the way it 
                         will end up for us.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's not something I wanted either.

                                     MILES
                         But then -- I guess -- something 
                         inside me died when I realized that 
                         you'd hired a goon to kill me.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt 
                         when I realized you'd hired the goon 
                         to kill...

                                     RUTH
                         Now you both wait a minute. Nobody 
                         hired anyone to kill anyone.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Hear, hear.

               There is an uncomfortable shifting in seats. Wrigley looks 
               at Miles.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Apparently, from what I can gather, 
                         a burglar broke into your house -- 
                         became despondent over his lifestyle 
                         and shot himself.

               Miles is still looking at Marylin.

                                     MILES
                         Where does that leave us?

                                     RUTH
                         We've outlined a settlement...

               She pushes a piece of paper across the table.

                                     RUTH
                         We think it's more than generous.

               Miles ignores the paper, which lies unclaimed on the middle 
               of the table. He looks at Marylin.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         My client is prepared to consider a 
                         reconciliation.

               Marylin looks a Miles.

                                     MARYLIN
                         How could I trust you, after... after 
                         all of this.

               Miles, staring at Marylin, cuts in:

                                     MILES
                         You wounded me first, Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?

                                     MILES
                         You're forgetting Howard Doyle?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Forgery? Fraud?

                                     MILES
                         Income tax evasion?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Murder?

                                     MILES
                         Murder!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't see how we can ever find our 
                         way back from...

               Miles, with his eyes still on Marylin, reaches into his suit 
               coat. He withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the 
               table in front of him and, still gazing at her:

                                     MILES
                         You know... there's nothing in the 
                         Massey pre-nup that says it can't be 
                         executed after the parties wed.

               He decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks 
               down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name.

               He pushes the paper across the table toward Marylin.

               Gazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently 
               picks up the paper.

               There is a long silence. We hear only the hum of ventilation, 
               and Wrigley's quiet snuffling.

               Ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses -- over 
               Marylin's shoulder -- at the sheet of paper. Marylin however, 
               looks only at Miles.

                                     RUTH
                         It's the Massey pre-nup --

               Marylin rips the paper in half.

                                     RUTH
                              (bored)
                         O-kay. I'm going back to the office

               Wrigley sobs openly.

                                     RUTH
                         Come on Wrigley, I'll buy you a drink 
                         and an anti depressant.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         No one will ever love me that way.

                                     RUTH
                         Not if you're lucky. No.

               Miles rises slowly to his feet.

               He puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward.

               Marylin rises slowly to her feet.

               She leans forward.

               They kiss.

                                     MILES
                         Let's go home.

               EXT. MASSEY HOUSE - DAY

               We hear a SMASHING -- BREAKING.

               Gardeners look up briefly from the leaf blowing -- but quickly 
               prioritize and continue blasting sycamore leaves from one 
               end of the yard to the other.

               TRACK THROUGH HOUSE TO

               INT. MASSEY BEDROOM

               The smashing is becoming louder.

               AN AXE

               Breaks the beautiful wood panelling in the room next to the 
               master suite.

                                     MILES
                         Wait. Just wait for one minute. Sweet 
                         Jesus, are you crazy?

               CONSTRUCTION WORKER LOOKS UP

               he's the one wielding the axe. His co-worker casts a look in 
               our direction.

               MILES

               reaches under the rubble and removes one box of Cohiba 
               Especials.

                                     CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                         Sorry, Mr. Massey. Thought you cleared 
                         that shit out.

                                     CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2
                         You know, man... those things'll 
                         kill ya. I know all you old boomer 
                         potheads like em. They're illegal, 
                         and you get to put em in fancy boxes -- 
                         but -- shit man! It's still tobacco.

               Miles looks at the box, then at his wife. He tosses the box

          EXT. CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - DAY
          
          A small caveman community made up of five large caves, all
          facing out towards a crackling fire.
          
          Slack-jawed, yet strong and confident CAVEMEN stumble about,
          dragging haunches of meat, pounding the dirt with sticks,
          dragging the women.
          
          WE PAN OVER to a small cave. Not even really a cave at all,
          but a crack in the rocks barely large enough to sleep in.
          Stepping out of this "cave" is a small, weak, nerdy-looking
          caveman.
          
          The chief caveman, set apart by the large mallet he wields,
          steps towards the fire and grunts loudly to mark the
          beginning of a caveman meeting.
          
          "Loser caveman" steps forward apprehensively, only to be met
          with laughter from the other cavemen. "Loser caveman" sighs
          and shrinks back into his sad, little cave, watching them
          from the shadows.
          
                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
                        (grunting; subtitled)
                    Me see beast today. Beast scary.
                    Beast danger for caveman.
          
          The rest of the cavemen look nervous.
          
                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
                    If caveman kill beast? Caveman
                    safe. Caveman have food.
          
          The cavemen grunt in understanding.
          
                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
                    Who kill beast?
          
          The cavemen grunt amongst themselves. The toughest of the
          bunch steps forward, pounds his chest and grunts.
          
                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
                    Grob kill beast. Good Grob.
          
          The chief notices "loser caveman" watching from a distance.
          
                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
                    Loser want kill beast?
          
          All the cavemen turn and laugh at the "loser caveman".
          
                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
                    Loser kill nothing!
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          All the cavemen laugh hysterically.
          
                              CAVEMAN #1
                    Look at Loser cave! So small!
          
                              CAVEMAN #2
                    Loser dumb!
          
                              CAVEMAN #3
                    Fuck that guy!
          
          All the cavemen pick up rocks and begin throwing them at the
          "loser caveman", who dives out of his cave and runs around
          the camp, dodging their blows.
          
          
          EXT. CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - NIGHT
          
          Everyone in the village is asleep. Everyone, that is, but
          "loser caveman" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little
          cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable.
          
          A stirring in the trees causes "loser caveman" to sit
          upright. There's something outside of the village. Something
          big.
          
          Suddenly a GIANT TUSKED BOAR pushes through the trees and
          stands, looking quite menacing, not ten yards from the
          village fire.
          
          "Loser caveman" is practically shaking with fear. The boar
          makes eye-contact with "loser caveman" and charges directly
          towards his tiny little cave.
          
          The giant boar runs head first into the cave opening, but the
          opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside.
          "Loser caveman" screams like a girl.
          
          The boar backs up to strike again -- this one sure to be the
          end of "loser caveman" -- when a large boulder, knocked loose
          by the Boar's first hit, tumbles down and lands smack on the
          Boar's head, killing it instantly.
          
          The entire village runs out to see what has happened. The
          "Loser caveman" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself
          off.
          
          The chief steps forward.
          
                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
                    The beast! It dead!
          
                                                                     3.
          
          
                              CAVEMAN #2
                    Hey, look at loser! He almost die!
                    Look he scared!
          
          Everyone laughs. The Chief looks towards Loser, standing
          nervously near the corpse of the Giant Tusked Boar.
          
                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
                    Loser, what happen?
          
                              LOSER CAVEMAN
                        (SHAMEFULLY)
                    The Beast, it came at me. It smash
                    my cave.
          
          Everyone laughs hysterically. WE PAN over the many laughing
          faces, pointing and hooting at loser caveman's cowardice. We
          watch as the "loser caveman's" face turns bright red, the
          veins in his neck pop out and his fists clench up tightly.
          
          SUDDENLY WE FLY into the caveman's skull, traveling through
          his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his
          small, homo erectus brain. Sparks are flying back and forth
          across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession.
          
          There is a SMALL EXPLOSION.
          
          We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face
          contorted in rage.
          
          He interrupts everyone's laughter.
          
                              LOSER CAVEMAN
                    Hold on one minute!
          
          Everyone stops laughing.
          
                              LOSER CAVEMAN
                    Loser wasn't finished.
          
          Loser caveman stands up straight and tall -- all of a sudden
          the Bruce Willis of cavemen.
          
                              LOSER CAVEMAN
                    After beast smash cave, Loser look
                    at beast and say, "not on Loser's
                    watch." Loser grab rock on ground,
                    lift above head and smash it
                    down... right onto motherfucker's
                    head.
          
          The entire village gasps.
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
                                LOSER CAVEMAN
                      Loser kill beast.
                          (PAUSE)
                      Now fuck off, Loser going back to
                      sleep.
          
          The chief steps forward ominously, then proclaims:
          
                                CHIEF CAVEMAN
                      Loser kill beast! Loser caveman
                      hero!
          
          Loser steps forward, grabs the prettiest of all cavewomen and
          drags her towards his cave as the entire village erupts in
          cheer.
          
          FREEZE FRAME:
          
                                NARRATOR
                      The world's first lie. A monumental
                      occasion in the history of mankind.
                          (PAUSE)
                      That lowly caveman who stumbled
                      upon the ability to lie went on to
                      become chief of his village,
                      married dozens of cavewomen, and
                      passed on the lying gene to
                      hundreds of newborn cave-children.
                          (PAUSE)
                      Over time lying spread throughout
                      the world, sparking the eventual
                      birth of imagination itself, story-
                      telling, religion, and the oh-so-
                      important polite lie, as in, "Oh
                      Patty, have you lost weight? You
                      look fantastic."
                          (PAUSE)
                      The world would be a very different
                      place if events had gone otherwise
                      on that prolific, Paleolithic eve.
                      If not for that night, man would
                      have never acquired the ability to
                      lie to himself and to others.
                          (PAUSE)
                      A world without lying would be a
                      world without dreams. A world
                      without pretense. A world without
                      fiction. A world without flattery.
                      A world very unlike our own.
          
          UNFREEZE:
          
          The film rewinds about thirty seconds, to the point where the
          chief asked what happened with "loser caveman" and the boar.
          
                                                                    5.
          
          
                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
                    Loser, what happen?
          
                              LOSER CAVEMAN
                        (SHAMEFULLY)
                    The Beast, it came at me. It smash
                    my cave.
          
          AGAIN WE FLY into the caveman's skull, traveling through his
          homo erectus brain. Sparks are flying back and forth across
          his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession...
          
          But this time there's no explosion.
          
          We fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull -- his face
          contorted in rage.
          
          The rage slowly fades and Loser just stands there, everyone
          in the camp waiting for him to say something.
          
                              LOSER CAVEMAN
                    Rock fall on beast. Loser do
                    nothing. I think Loser even soil
                    bear pants.
                        (pause; sniffing)
                    Loser smell bad.
          
          Everyone falls onto the ground laughing hysterically.
          
                              CHIEF CAVEMAN
                    Loser biggest loser ever! Caveman,
                    throw rocks at loser!
          
          Everyone in the camp joins in on another round of throwing
          rocks at "loser caveman" as he runs around the camp,
          terrified and miserable.
          
                                                       FADE TO BLACK.

          complex.
          
          MARK BELLISON pulls up in his early nineties Volvo, parks and
          enters.

                              JENNIFER
                    Hi. You're early. I was just
                    masturbating.
          
                              MARK
                    That makes me think of your vagina.
                    I'm Mark, how are you?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    A little frustrated at the moment.
                    Also equally depressed and
                    pessimistic about our date tonight.
                    I'm Jennifer.
          
                              MARK
                    I hope this date ends in sex.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Not me. I don't find you
                    attractive. Come on in.
          
          Mark enters.

          Jennifer's apartment is new-adult, as if she just found out
          she was an adult yet hasn't had the time or the money to
          complete the transition.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I need to finish getting ready.
                    While doing that I might realize
                    I'm still horny and try to finish
                    masturbating without you hearing.
          
          Jennifer heads towards the bathroom. Mark stands alone in her
          living room, looking around.
          
                              MARK
                        (shouting to her)
                    I feel awkward and I regret being
                    early.
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
                              JENNIFER (O.S.)
                        (shouting back)
                    Yeah, I'm disappointed you're early
                    and not really looking forward to
                    tonight in general, but the thought
                    of being alone the rest of my life
                    scares both my mother and I
                    equally.
          
          It's completely silent for a long beat. Mark looks around,
          then sits on her couch.
          
                              MARK
                        (shouting to her)
                    I have an erection now because I
                    assume you began masturbating once
                    we stopped talking.
          
          More silence.
          
                              MARK
                        (shouting to her)
                    I'm embarrassed because I think the
                    restaurant I've made reservations
                    at might not be expensive enough or
                    hip enough to impress you, but it
                    was the best I could do because I
                    don't make very much money. You
                    see, I'm forty years old and have
                    no real financial assets to speak
                    of, I've never owned a home, and
                    never had a significant
                    relationship. My boss even told me
                    today that I'm most likely going to
                    get fired tomorrow and...
          
          Jennifer enters the room and Mark stops talking.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I just masturbated.
          
                              MARK
                    That makes me very horny.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Shall we go?
          
                              MARK
                    Sure.
          
          Mark stands up. Jennifer picks up her purse and opens the
          door.
          
                                                           8.

          Mark and Jennifer drive in silence for a beat.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'm only doing this as a favor for
                    my cousin Greg. He keeps begging me
                    to go out on a date with you. He
                    says you're funny.
          
                              MARK
                    Greg's a good friend.

                    A cute little place called La
                    Bonisera in West Hollywood.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    You obviously don't have very much
                    money but that's not necessarily a
                    deal breaker.
          
                              MARK
                    I have very little money.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I also don't really care about a
                    guy who knows all the latest,
                    hippest restaurants.

                    In fact, there are very few things
                    in life that I care about all that
                    much. The only things I have to
                    offer myself or anyone else are my
                    good looks and my affected sense of
                    quirkiness which artistically
                    inclined men interpret as
                    intellect.

                    In fact, I think my best trait is
                    the fact that I've made very few
                    mistakes: socially, academically,
                    financially or romantically. I take
                    very few risks and therefore lead a
                    relatively happy and light-hearted
                    existence. Mostly though, I'm a
                    kind, sweet person with the
                    potential of genuinely becoming a
                    vital and interesting human being
                    the day I take the energy I expend
                    on hyper self-reflexivity and apply
                    it to actual action in the reality
                    of my life.

                    I found that boring and started

                    Of course, come with me.
          
          The hostess seats them in the midst of the semi-crowded
          restaurant.
          
          A young, awkward waiter approaches.
          
                              WAITER

                    And you're pretty and that only
                    makes me feel worse. Can I get you
                    two started on some drinks?
          
                              MARK
                    I'll have a Budweiser.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'll start with your Mango
                    Margarita and probably have three
                    more drinks by the end of the
                    night.
          
                               WAITER
                    Excellent.

                    She's out of your league.

                    Yup.
          
          The waiter leaves. Jennifer and Mark peruse their menus. A
          woman screams out from a table on the other side of the room:

                    I'm going to ask you some questions
                    about your life because that's what
                    you do, but I'll only really listen
                    to about half of what you're
                    saying.

                    I get up at eight in the morning
                    because the noise from my alarm
                    clock interrupts my sleep, so I

                    No. But I enjoy the end result of
                    the job which is money. And the
                    hours are pretty good for the
                    amount of money I make, which I
                    spend on things I like, such as
                    clothes, hiking, drinking -- even
                    though I know it's bad for me.

                              JENNIFER
                    Usually. Some days I stay in bed
                    eating and crying.
          
                                 MARK
                    Sure.
          
          The waiter returns with their drinks.

                    Here you go.
                        (hands drink to Jennifer)
                    I had a sip of this.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Okay.
          
                              WAITER
                    Do you guys know what you want or
                    do you need a moment?
          
                                 MARK
                    I'm ready.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'll have a caesar salad with
                    chicken because I think I'm fat but
                    I also think I deserve something
                    that tastes good.
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
                              MARK
                    I'll have the fish taco's because I
                    had them once here and it's all I
                    know.
          
                              WAITER
                    Excellent, I'll get those both
                    started for you.
          
          The waiter leaves. Jennifer's cell phone rings from inside
          her purse.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Sorry, one second.
          
          She pulls out her cell phone and checks it.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    It's my mother, this won't take
                    long. Probably checking in on our
                    date.
          
          Jennifer answers the phone. She talks openly and in plain
          view of Mark.
          
                              JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                    Hello? Yes, I'm with him right now.
                    No, not very attractive. No,
                    doesn't make much money. He's all
                    right though. Seems nice. Kind of
                    funny. A bit fat. Funny little snub
                    nose. No, I won't be sleeping with
                    him tonight. Nope, probably not
                    even a kiss. Okay, you too. Bye.
          
          Jennifer hangs up.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Sorry about that.
          
                              MARK
                    Don't think twice. How is your mom?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    She's all right.
          
                                 MARK
                    Fantastic.
          
          
          TIME CUT: LATER THAT NIGHT
          
          Both of their plates are now empty. Three empty Margarita
          glasses sit in front of Jennifer.
          
                                                                   14.
          
          
          The waiter approaches with the bill and places it down in the
          middle of the table.
          
                              WAITER
                        (to Jennifer)
                    If I give you my number will you
                    call me?
          
                               JENNIFER
                    No.
          
          
          EXT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT
          
          Mark walks Jennifer to the front door of her apartment
          complex.
          
                              MARK
                    Thanks for going on this date with
                    me. You're way, way out of my
                    league and I know you were just
                    doing it as a favor to Greg, and
                    that most likely I'll never hear
                    from you again.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I actually had a better time than I
                    thought I'd have, but I won't know
                    for sure how I feel about you until
                    I'm less drunk.
          
                              MARK
                    Give me a call if you still like me
                    once you're sober.
          
                               JENNIFER
                    I might.
          
          Mark leans in for a kiss. Jennifer kisses him on the cheek
          and goes inside.
          
                              MARK
                    Thanks for kissing me on the cheek,
                    I know you didn't have to do that
                    and....
          
          Jennifer waves and heads inside.
          
                              MARK
                        (shouting after her)
                    ... you're very pretty. Thank you!
          
                                                                  15.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mark plops into bed in his boxers. His bedroom is bland,
          uninspired and completely furnished by the cheapest stuff
          found in an IKEA catalogue.
          
          Mark flips on the TV and gets under the covers. A commercial
          comes on TV.
          
          INSERT: COMMERCIAL
          
          A man in a suit stands next to a single can of coke resting
          on a small table.
          
                              JIM
                    Hi, I'm Jim and I'm the
                    spokesperson for the Coca-Cola
                    company. I'm here today to ask you
                    to continue buying coke. I'm sure
                    it's a drink you've been drinking
                    for years, and if you still enjoy
                    it, I'd like to remind you to buy
                    it again sometime soon. It's
                    basically just brown sugar water,
                    we haven't changed the ingredients
                    much lately, so there's nothing new
                    about it I can say. We changed the
                    can around a little bit. See, the
                    colors here are a little different,
                    and we even put a polar bear on it
                    for the kids. Also, coke is very
                    high in sugar, can lead to obesity
                    in children and adults who don't
                    sustain a healthy diet, and has a
                    Ph acidity level high enough to
                    dissolve teeth and bones over
                    extended periods of time. Coke also
                    works great at removing corrosion
                    from car batteries and loosening
                    rusted bolts. So that's it, it's
                    coke. Everyone knows it. It's very
                    famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke,
                    and I'm asking you to not stop
                    buying coke. That's all. Thanks.
          
          INSERT: Coke logo with tagline: "It's Coke. It's very
          famous."
          
          Mark falls asleep with the TV on.
          
                                                           FADE TO:

          THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Mark's alarm clock blares. Groggily he rises and sighs
          deeply. He has nothing to look forward to today. Or any day.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR - MARK'S APARTMENT - MORNING
          
          Mark stands in his building's elevator. The doors open and
          FRANK, mid-forties and bald, enters.
          
                              FRANK
                    Hi Mark. How's it going?
          
                              MARK
                    Not so good. Last night I went on a
                    date with a girl I've had a crush
                    on for years who will most likely
                    never call me again and I'm pretty
                    sure I'm going to get fired today.
                    You?
          
                              FRANK
                    I spent the whole night throwing up
                    pain killers because I'm too afraid
                    to take enough to kill myself.
          
          The elevator doors open on the lobby. Mark nods at Frank.
          
                              MARK
                    See you tomorrow.
          
                              FRANK
                    Bye.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S CAR -- MORNING
          
          As Mark drives to work we take in a bit of his world.
          
          A homeless man stands on a street corner with a sign that
          reads: "I don't understand why I'm homeless and all of you
          are not."
          
          A business man talking loudly into his cell phone pulls up
          next to mark at a red light.
          
                              BUSINESS MAN
                    I'm not talking to anyone on my
                    cell phone. I only want people to
                    assume I'm very busy.
          
          At another red light Mark eavesdrops on a couple having a
          loud argument in front of a coffee shop.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
                              GIRLFRIEND
                    I woke up this morning and realized
                    that, not only do I not love you,
                    but that the thought of touching
                    you sickens me.
          
                              BOYFRIEND
                    The more you hate me the more I
                    fall in love with you.
          
          A Bus passes in front of Mark's car.
          
          ANGLE ON: The bus ad simply shows a can of Pepsi, and reads:
          "Pepsi. When they don't have Coke."
          
          A car honks behind Mark. The man leans out of his car and
          yells at Mark.
          
                              HONKING MAN
                    Move it, fatty!
          
          Mark drives forward, waving to the man apologetically as the
          man zooms past him.
          
          
          EXT. LECTURE FILMS - CAR LOT - DAY
          
          Mark parks his car and walks towards a large office building.
          The sign on the building reads: "LECTURE FILMS MOTION PICTURE
          STUDIOS -- We Film Someone Telling You About Things That
          Happened."
          
          In front of the building is a man in a suit standing on his
          briefcase with his tie around his head, screaming.
          
                              SCREAMING MAN
                    This isn't natural! None of this is
                    natural! We're all animals! This
                    doesn't feel right! Why am I
                    wearing clothes? How can you people
                    live like this? Where did all this
                    concrete come from?!
          
          Mark walks right by him. A woman in a business suit stops him
          on his way through the front door.
          
                              WOMAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
                    I don't want to go in there today.
                    I just don't. You know?
          
          Mark nods understandingly and enters the building.
          
                                                                  18.
          
          
          INT. LECTURE FILMS - LOBBY - MORNING
          
          As Mark walks through the lobby we get a brief glimpse of
          some of the movie posters lining the wall: "The Holocaust",
          "The Death of the Dinosaurs", "Napoleon", "The Civil War".
          
          Each poster shows a different austere man sitting in a chair,
          holding a script in his lap, with a title above his head. The
          posters are extremely boring.
          
          A tour guide leads a row of tourists through the lobby. As
          Mark enters we overhear the tour guide's speech.
          
                              TOUR GUIDE
                    All of Lecture Films' productions
                    are written, filmed and edited
                    right here on this very lot. In
                    fact, this building is where
                    Lecture Films' talented writers
                    scour through the world's past
                    events, searching for the most
                    entertaining, dramatic and even
                    hilarious moments of world history,
                    which are then turned into scripts,
                    handed over to our world-famous
                    Readers, and filmed for your
                    viewing pleasure.
          
          The whole tour "oohs". The tour guide walks over towards a
          large flat-screen television embedded into the wall.

                    this monitor you'll get a sneak
                    peak at Lecture Film's upcoming
                    summer's blockbuster: "Napoleon
                    1812 to 1813."
          
          Everyone "oohs" again. Mark, curious as well, stops to watch
          the trailer with the tour.
          
          ANGLE ON: TV SCREEN. A black screen.
          
                              NARRATOR
                    Coming this summer from Lecture
                    Films Motion Picture Studios.
                    Written by Oscar winning
                    screenwriter Rob Marlowe.
          
          INTERCUT Mark scowling at this name.
          
                                                                     19.
          
          
                              NARRATOR (O.S.)
                    And starring Oscar winning Reader
                    Nathan Goldfrappe, comes the epic
                    sequel to last year's most talked
                    about film: "Napoleon 1810 to
                    1811". Prepare for the adventure.
          
          The black fades to NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE, a middle-aged austere
          man sitting before a fire in a velvet smoking jacket, holding
          a script.
          
                              NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE
                        (READING)
                    And so Napoleon invaded Russia with
                    a brute force of nearly seven
                    hundred thousand men behind him
                    armed with muskets and supported by
                    canon brigades.
          
                              NARRATOR (O.S.)
                    Learn of his defeat.
          
                              NATHAN GOLDFRAPPE
                        (READING)
                    Through the devastating snow they
                    marched, crippled by disease and
                    hunger, Napoleon's men marched on.
          
                              NARRATOR (O.S.)
                    Listen to his redemption.
          
          INTERCUT the tour, enraptured by this trailer. A few of the
          tourists whisper to each other.
          
                              TOURIST #1
                    I love these films. Saves me
                    reading the book.
          
          INTERCUT the trailer title slamming onto the screen:
          
                              NARRATOR
                    Napoleon 1812 to 1813. Coming this
                    summer from Lecture Films.
          
          The trailer ends and the tour applauds. The tour guide turns
          to find Mark walking away.
          
                              TOUR GUIDE
                    Look everyone, there goes Mark
                    Bellison, one of Lecture Films very
                    own screenwriters!
          
          The whole tour turns towards Mark. Mark turns around and
          dejectedly waves.
          
                                                                  20.

                        (PAUSE)
                    I also hear he's most likely
                    getting fired today.
          
          The tour nods at Mark. Mark nods back.

                    Now let's head to editing bay where
                    we can watch....
          
          
          INT. LECTURE FILMS - WRITER'S OFFICES - MORNING
          
          Mark walks past cubicle after cubicle until he comes to his
          office and SHELLEY, his attractive late-20's receptionist.
          
                               MARK
                    Hi Shelley. I'm still attracted to
                    you today.
          
                              SHELLEY
                    Hi Mark. Everyday I realize more
                    and more how over-qualified I am
                    for this position and how
                    incompetent you are at yours.
          
                              MARK
                    Any messages?
          
                              SHELLEY
                    Anthony's coming by within the hour
                    to see if he can work up the
                    courage to fire you. If he can't,
                    he said he'll definitely do it
                    tomorrow.
          
                              MARK
                    Nobody else called? No calls to do
                    with actual work?
          
                              SHELLEY
                    Well, I told everybody you were
                    getting fired this week and not to
                    expect their calls returned, so no
                    one left any messages.
          
                               MARK
                    Next time I'd rather you took down
                    the messages just in case I don't
                    get fired.
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
                              SHELLEY
                    You're almost definitely getting
                    fired.
          
                              MARK
                    Well, it hasn't happened yet.
          
                              SHELLEY
                    Okay, but everybody knows you are.
          
                              MARK
                    Okay, I'll be in my office.
          
                              SHELLEY
                    Okay, I'll be searching for new
                    jobs on Craigslist.
          
          
          INT. LECTURE FILMS - MARK'S OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Mark's office is completely boring and unremarkable, much
          like his apartment.
          
          There's a knock on his door.
          
          ANTHONY enters, looking very much the boss in his expensive
          suit, yet nervous and fearful as well.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    Wow, you look really depressed
                    today. That's going to make this so
                    much harder.
          
                              MARK
                    Anthony, don't fire me.
          
          Anthony sits down on the other side of Mark's desk and leans
          forward.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    Mark, the 1300's are boring.
                    Nothing interesting happened in
                    that century. Nobody cares about
                    the post-Roman, pre-enlightenment
                    era. The last few scripts you
                    turned in were depressing.
          
                              MARK
                    They were about the black plague!
                    It's the 1300's Anthony, what else
                    am I going to write about!
          
                                                                   22.
          
          
                              ANTHONY
                    It's not totally your fault, Mark.
                    You got stuck with a bad century.
          
                              MARK
                    No! I can make it work!
          
                              ANTHONY
                    Give it up Mark, it's not like
                    something new is going to have
                    happened in the 1300's. At Lecture
                    Films we're no longer interested in
                    searching through the less well-
                    known historical periods for great
                    events, we just want to take the
                    big name Reader's of the day and
                    have them read the historical
                    events that people know and love:
                    the holocaust, D-day, the birth of
                    electricity. These are the stories
                    people want to see, because they
                    know them. They find comfort in
                    them.
          
          Anthony pauses.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    Do you think I could come back and
                    do this tomorrow? I just got very
                    nervous about firing you. I don't
                    do well with confrontation.
          
                              MARK
                    Is there anyway you could do it
                    now? I'd rather not put it off.
          
          Anthony thinks for a moment, struggling to find the courage.
          
                              ANTHONY
                        (MEEKLY)
                    You're fired?
          
                              MARK
                    Damn.
          
          Anthony slinks out of the room. Mark looks down at his
          computer to see he has an email in his inbox.
          
          ANGLE ON: MARK'S COMPUTER -- The email reads: "I woke up this
          morning, sober, and realized that, while I did enjoy your
          company, based on your looks, your financial situation and
          your position in life, I have no interest in you
          romantically. I'm just too far out of your league. --
          JENNIFER"
          
                                                                  23.
          
          
          Mark sits back in his chair and sighs deeply.
          
                              MARK
                    She's a really good writer, too.
          
          
          INT. LECTURE FILMS - WRITER'S OFFICES - MORNING
          
          With all of his meager belongings stuffed into a box, Mark
          leaves his office, stopping in front of Shelley's desk.
          
                              SHELLEY
                    I loathed almost every minute I
                    worked for you.
          
                              MARK
                    I often fantasized about you naked.
          
                              SHELLEY
                    What are you going to do now?
          
                              MARK
                    I have no idea. But I have very
                    little hope for the future.
          
                              SHELLEY
                    I don't have much hope for you
                    either, but I wish you good luck.
          
                              MARK
                    Bye, Shelley.
          
                                 SHELLEY
                    Bye, Mark.
          
          Mark heads towards the elevator and is stopped by ROB
          MARLOWE, a little weasel man with a hip haircut and expensive
          clothes.
          
                              ROB
                    So they fucking fired you, huh
                    dipshit? I always knew the Black
                    Plague would never work as a movie.
                    Guess the 1300's were as much of a
                    loser as you are.
          
                              MARK
                    Please don't make me feel worse. Or
                    actually whatever, go ahead, I
                    don't think I could possibly feel
                    worse.
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
                               ROB
                    I fucking always hated you. You're
                    a shitty writer assigned to a
                    shitty century and you're a little
                    man bitch. But I was always
                    threatened by you because I knew
                    there was something different about
                    you that I didn't understand and I
                    fucking hate things I don't
                    understand. But you will always be
                    a loser and I will always be more
                    successful than you in nearly every
                    way. That's just the way it is. And
                    Shelley calls you an ass fag behind
                    your back.
          
                              MARK
                    Well, now I feel worse.
          
          Rob storms off. Mark slinks into the elevator and hangs his
          head in shame as the doors close.
          
          
          EXT. ELDERLY HOME - DAY
          
          ANGLE ON SIGN: "A SAD PLACE FOR HOPELESS OLD PEOPLE"
          
          Mark enters the building.
          
          
          INT. ELDERLY HOME - DAY
          
          Mark walks up to the front desk to find a young receptionist.
          
                              RECEPTIONIST
                    Are you looking to abandon an
                    elderly person?

                    I already have. Martha Bellison.

                              RECEPTIONIST
                    Ooh, it's good you're here. She's
                    not doing well. You should say your
                    final goodbyes today.
          
                              MARK
                    You say that every time I'm here.
          
                              RECEPTIONIST
                    She's at the top of our death pool.

          Mark walks down the hall, passing different elderly people
          who reach out to him.
          
                              ELDERLY PERSON #1
                    You look like my dead son.

                    I'm on pills that make everything
                    orange.
          
          Mark opens a door and enters.
          
          
          INT. MARTHA SCHIFFMAN'S ROOM - DAY
          
          An elderly woman in a light blue robe sits on the side of her
          bed, with her back to Mark, staring at the wall only inches
          from her face.
          
                              MARK
                    Oh Grandma, that is so depressing.
                    Come on, at least stare at the
                    ceiling or something.
          
          Mark takes his grandmother by the hand and steers her to the
          other side of her bed.
          
                              MARTHA
                    The television is broken.
          
                              MARK
                    The television isn't broken. You
                    probably sat on the remote and
                    changed it to channel two again.
          
          Mark flicks on the TV with the remote. Static fills the
          screen. He changes the channel and a picture comes into view.
          
                              MARK
                    See, you had it on the wrong
                    channel. It needs to be on channel
                    three in order for the satellite to
                    work.
          
                               MARTHA
                    I don't understand anything you
                    just said and that makes me scared
                    and angry.
          
                                                26.
          
          
                    MARK
          I can't understand what it feels
          like to be you so it just irritates
          me and makes me think you're
          stupid. But I also love you and
          wish things were better for you.
          
                      MARTHA
          I do too.
          
                    MARK
          Grandma, I lost my job today. I'm
          forty years old. I'm completely
          alone and I've got absolutely no
          prospects for anything.
          
                     MARTHA
          I'm sorry, Mark. Things aren't any
          better for me here. I can't afford
          most of my medication, I'm very
          alone and I forget more and more
          every day.
          
                    MARK
          I'm just so tired of life. Why does
          life have to be so... what's the
          word? Don't you sometimes wish you
          could change things? Don't you
          sometimes wish you weren't such a
          loser?
          
                    MARTHA
          I don't think I'm a loser.
          
                    MARK
          Of course you're a loser, grandma.
          Our family is made up of losers.
          We're all poor, we're all average
          looking, we're all only moderately
          intelligent, we're all lonely and
          unloved.
          
                    MARTHA
          Well, we're poor because we weren't
          born with money and it's very hard
          to make enough money in a single
          lifetime to move from one social
          class to another. We're only
          moderately intelligent because
          there's been a lot of inbreeding in
          our lineage. And we're only lonely
          and unloved right now. Remember,
          I've had two husbands I loved very
          much in my lifetime.

                    Yeah, but I'm not talking about the
                    past, Grandma. I'm talking about
                    right now. And right now we're both
                    losers, Grandma. We're both shitty,
                    shitty losers. Don't you know that?
          
                              MARTHA
                    I suppose we are. But things could
                    be worse. We could be homeless.
          
                              MARK
                    I'd rather be dead than be
                    homeless. That's why I need to get
                    out there and find a job. If I have
                    to be homeless, I'm going to kill
                    myself.
          
                              MARTHA
                    Well that's sad. I love you, Mark.
                    Good luck finding a job!
          
                              MARK
                    I love you too, Grandma.
          
          Mark leaves. As he shuts the door from the hallway he hears
          the channel change and turn back to static.
          
                                 MARTHA (O.S.)

          Mark and his friend GREG (40'S), an even less attractive,
          less interesting and less intelligent version of Mark, are
          bellied up the bar with half empty beers in front of them.
          
                              MARK
                    I'll start looking for a job

                    though. I fucking hate white

                    Hey, thanks for setting me up with
                    your cousin by the way.
          
                              GREG
                    Third cousin. She's hot right?
          
                              MARK
                    Very.

                    Way out of your league. Dunno why
                    you bothered.
          
                              MARK
                    It felt nice to go out with someone
                    that pretty. Like for just one
                    moment I experienced what it would
                    be like to be the type of person
                    someone like that would date. It
                    felt good. Doesn't matter anyway. I
                    will always be just who I am right
                    now: average looking, of average
                    intelligence with an average
                    personality. Just a completely
                    generic human being.
          
                              GREG
                    Your life is still better than
                    mine.
          
                              MARK
                    By a good margin.
          
          A sad beat.
          
                              GREG
                    Lately I've been crying in my sleep
                    and waking up in a pool of urine.
          
                              MARK
                    I really wish I had a better friend
                    than you.
          
                              GREG
                    So, what are you going to do now?
          
                              MARK
                    I don't know. Guess I'll start
                    looking for another crappy job.
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
                              GREG
                    Doubt you'll find one. Not much
                    need for an out-of-work writer
                    specializing in the Black Plague.
          
          Mark downs his last shot.
          
                              MARK
                    I'm going to go now. You're
                    seriously depressing me. I really
                    wish I was cool enough to have a
                    better friend than you.
          
                              GREG
                    I'm the best you're gonna get, man.
                    Call me later.
          
                              MARK
                    Yeah.
          
          Mark gets up and drunkenly stumbles out of the bar.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mark drunkenly lies in bed. He picks up the phone and dials.
          
                              JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                    Hello?
          
          Mark just breathes, too scared to say anything.
          
                              JENNIFER (ON PHONE)
                    Hello? I can hear you breathing. Is
                    this a rapist?
          
                              MARK
                        (QUICKLY)
                    No, it's Mark. I'm sorry.
          
          Mark hangs up quickly, embarrassed and ashamed. He sighs and
          turns off the light.
          
                                                            FADE TO:
          
          
          THE NEXT MORNING
          
          The alarm clock goes off.
          
                              MARK
                    Shut the fuck up, I don't even have
                    a job!
          
                                                                  30.
          
          
          Mark tosses the alarm clock across the room and goes back to
          bed.
          
          LATER.
          
          A loud banging wakes Mark who groggily stumbles out of bed.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Mark opens the door to find his landlord, a middle aged, well-
          groomed man.
          
                              LANDLORD
                    I'm here for the rent.
          
                              MARK
                    I was going to come talk to you
                    about that. I got fired yesterday.
          
                              LANDLORD
                    I know. That's why I'm here for the
                    rent.
          
                              MARK
                    Well, I haven't got it.
          
                              LANDLORD
                    How much do you have?
          
                              MARK
                    I think I've got about three
                    hundred dollars in my bank account.
          
                              LANDLORD
                    The rent is eight hundred dollars.
          
                              MARK
                    I know. I haven't got it.
          
                              LANDLORD
                    Then you're evicted. I'll help you
                    with your things.
          
          A stunned Mark stands helpless as the Landlord pushes past
          him, grabs a lamp from his living room and carries it out
          into the hallway.
          
                              LANDLORD
                    Help me with the couch. It looks
                    heavy.
          
          Mark sighs and follows the Landlord back into his apartment.
          
                                                                  31.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
          
          With all of his belongings piled up in the hallway, a tired
          and sweaty Mark stares defeatedly at his landlord.
          
                              LANDLORD
                    You have one day to get your things
                    out of this hallway.
          
                              MARK
                    How am I supposed to do that?
          
                              LANDLORD
                    You've got three hundred dollars.
                    Rent a truck.
          
                              MARK
                    Oh, fuck me.
          
          Mark grits his teeth in rage.
          
          
          INT. BANK - DAY
          
          Mark steps up to the female teller at the bank. Mark is at
          the lowest point in his entire life.
          
                              BANK TELLER
                    How can I help you today?
          
                              MARK
                    I'd like to make a withdrawal.
          
                              BANK TELLER
                    Okay, sir. I'm confident I can help
                    you with that.
          
                              MARK
                    I've just been evicted from my
                    apartment so I need to withdraw
                    what I have left in my account so I
                    can move my things out. I guess I
                    need to close out my account to do
                    that.
                        (PAUSE)
                    I think I'm about to be homeless.
          
          CLOSE ON MARK: This sinks in.
          
                                                                  32.
          
          
                              BANK TELLER
                    Unfortunately sir the system is
                    down right now so I'm not going to
                    be able to perform an account
                    closure until the system is back
                    up. But I can assist you in a
                    withdrawal. How much would you like
                    to withdraw?
          
                              MARK
                    Well, I'd like to withdraw eight
                    hundred dollars.
          
          The bank teller smiles at Mark.
          
                              BANK TELLER
                    How much are you going to withdraw
                    today, sir?
          
                              MARK
                    All of it. Just whatever is left.
          
                              BANK TELLER
                    The system is down, sir. Please
                    tell me how much you have in your
                    account?
          
          At the peak of his despair something suddenly comes over
          Mark. His face turns a light shade of red as the wheels begin
          to spin in his brain. He is fighting something within.
          
          WE FLY into Mark's skull, traveling through his cerebral
          cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his brain. Sparks are
          flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire
          in rapid succession.
          
          There is a small explosion.
          
          We fly back out of Mark's skull -- his eyes are locked on the
          Bank Teller's like a deer in the headlights.
          
                                 BANK TELLER
                    Sir?
          
                              MARK
                        (awkwardly fast)
                    Eight hundred dollars.
          
                                 BANK TELLER
                    Pardon me?
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
                              MARK
                        (more confident)
                    I have eight hundred dollars in my
                    bank account.
          
          The teller locks eyes with Mark... then looks towards her
          computer.
          
                              BANK TELLER
                    Wait a second here. The system just
                    came back up.
                        (to co-worker)
                    System seems to be back up, guys.
                        (to Mark)
                    Just one second while I access your
                    account. You said you're
                    withdrawing eight hundred, correct?
          
          Mark breaks out in a cold sweat.
          
                              MARK
                    Yup.
          
          The bank teller types on her keyboard.
          
                              BANK TELLER
                    Well, look at this. It says here
                    you've only got three hundred
                    dollars in your account. But you
                    said you wanted to withdraw eight
                    hundred?
          
          Mark doesn't know what to say. He tries to speak but nothing
          comes out.
          
                              BANK TELLER
                    I apologize for this sir, but it
                    seems our system has made a
                    mistake. Hold on one second while I
                    go and get your eight hundred
                    dollars. Did you want that in large
                    or small bills?
          
          Mark gulps.
          
                              MARK
                    Large bills.
          
          The teller walks away. Mark looks around nervously, awkwardly
          smiling at the other tellers.
          
                                                                  34.
          
          
                              BANK TELLER
                        (to co-worker)
                    Guys the computers seem to be a bit
                    buggy. Will someone call James to
                    come in and look into it, please?
          
          Moments later the Bank Teller returns and begins counting out
          eight hundred dollars for Mark. Mark stares at the money with
          wide eyes.
          
                               BANK TELLER
                    There you are. Eight hundred
                    dollars. Anything else I can do for
                    you today?
          
          In shock, Mark shakes his head. The bank teller smiles big at
          him.
          
                              BANK TELLER
                    Sometimes our computers can get a
                    bit buggy, especially when the
                    system goes down. Sorry for any
                    inconvenience.
          
                              MARK
                    It's no problem.
          
          Mark takes his money and hurriedly walks away.
          
          
          EXT. STREET
          
          Bursting out of the bank, Mark is a caveman who just invented
          fire.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- UNIT 1A
          
          Mark knocks on his LANDLORD'S door. A short, stodgy old man
          opens the door.
          
                              LANDLORD
                    What are you doing here?
          
          Mark holds out a wad of money.
          
                              MARK
                    Paying my rent.
          
          The landlord looks at the money and slowly reaches out to
          take it.
          
                              LANDLORD
                    Where did you get this money?
          
                                                                    35.
          
          
                              MARK
                    It was amazing. I went in to the
                    bank and the system was down and I
                    was going to take out three hundred
                    dollars but she asked me how much
                    I'd like to take out and...
          
          Mark stops himself. Something else takes over within.
          
                              MARK
                    I found it. Lying on the street.
          
          The Landlord and Mark both lock eyes for a tense beat.
          
                              LANDLORD
                    Okay. Lucky.
          
                              MARK
                    Give me my key back.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Mark jumps around his apartment, dancing and screaming. Mark
          is a caveman who just invented sex.
          
                              MARK (V.O.)
                    Today I stumbled upon something no
                    man has ever stumbled upon before.
                    What I have done today they will
                    write about in history books for
                    generations to come. And yet, only
                    moments ago... it was unfathomable
                    not only to myself, but to mankind
                    as a whole. What I have found there
                    is no word for. And it was as
                    simple as...
                        (long pause)
                    ... how do I explain this...
                        (long pause)
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. BAR - DAY
          
          Mark and Greg sit at the bar, Greg half listening as an
          inspired Mark ends his monologue.
          
                              MARK (CONT'D)
                    ... I said something... that
                    wasn't.
          
          Greg perks up.
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
                              GREG
                    Huh?
          
                              MARK
                    I said something... that... wasn't.
                    I... what's the word I'm looking
                    for? Well, there is no word. Of
                    course there's not, I just invented
                    it.
          
          Mark is frustrated by his inability to explain.
          
                               MARK
                    Here. Watch.
                         (calling over bartender)
                    Jim.
          
          JIM, mid-40's, short and stout, waddles over.
          
                              JIM
                    What?
          
          Mark, stands up, clears his throat, and holds his hands out
          like "gimme some room".
          
          There's a long pause as Mark summons his newfound talent:
          
                              MARK
                        (PROFOUNDLY)
                    My name is Doug.
          
          Greg and Jim look at Mark confusedly.
          
                              GREG
                        (dead serious)
                    Your name is Doug.
          
                              JIM
                        (without hesitation)
                    Hi Doug.
          
                               GREG
                    It amazes me that I never knew your
                    real name.
                        (PAUSE)
                    Doug is good. It suits you.
          
          Mark is flabbergasted.
          
                              MARK
                    Come on guys. Are you serious?
                    What's my name?
          
                                                          37.
          
          
                                 GREG
                    It's Doug.
          
                                 JIM
                    Doug.
          
                              MARK
                    No. My name is Mark.
          
                              GREG
                        (still dead serious)
                    Your name is Mark.
          
                              JIM
                        (still without hesitation)
                    Hi Mark.
          
                              GREG
                    Mark suits you much better.
          
                                 JIM
                    Mark-o.
          
                              MARK
                    You guys aren't following me.
                        (THINKING)
                    Okay, guys...I'm black.
          
                                 GREG
                    I knew it.
          
                              JIM
                    You're very light skinned, but I
                    can see it.
          
                              GREG
                    I've always wanted a black friend.
          
          Mark punches the bar in anger.
          
                              MARK
                    Fuck it, I'm an Eskimo.
          
                                 GREG
                    Fantastic.
          
                              JIM
                    I've never seen a black Eskimo.
          
                              MARK
                    Okay, I'm a pirate.
          
                              GREG
                    I didn't know they still had those.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                              JIM
                    Are you a dangerous pirate?
          
                              MARK
                    Okay then, I'm a lion tamer... and
                    I have purple hair.
          
                              GREG
                    Aren't you scared you'll get bitten
                    one day?
          
                              JIM
                        (to Greg)
                    I want to die my hair purple just
                    like Mark's.
          
          Greg nods. Mark sighs.
          
          INSERT: "TWO HOURS LATER"
          
          Mark sits at the bar looking completely bored.
          
                              JIM
                    I'm a one-armed Jewish space
                    explorer.
          
                              GREG
                    When's your launch date?
          
                              JIM
                    Shalom. How'd you lose your arm?
          
                              MARK
                    I invented the bicycle.
          
                              GREG
                    I love your work.
          
                              JIM
                    Can you get me a discount on a ten
                    speed?
          
          Mark sighs, finishes his beer and gets up to leave.
          
                              MARK
                    I give up. And I'm bored.
          
          Mark heads towards the door, dejected. He turns back.
          
                              MARK
                    Guys, if you had the power to make
                    things the way you wanted them,
                    what would you do first?
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
                              GREG
                    If I could do anything in the
                    world?
          
                              JIM
                    Anything at all?
          
                              MARK
                    Pretty much.
          
          Greg and Jim think this over long and hard.
          
                              GREG
                    I'd bone bitches asses.
          
                              JIM
                    Right in the ass.
          
                              MARK
                    Specifically the ass?
          
                              GREG
                    If I could change things I would
                    make all the hot chicks bone me.
          
                              JIM
                    Agreed.
          
          Mark mulls this over.
          
                              MARK
                    Alright then, let's try that.
          
          Mark downs his beer and heads towards the exit.
          
                              GREG
                    Where are you going?
          
                              MARK
                    Out.
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Mark walks the street, a hunter looking for his prey.
          
          Within seconds Mark spots a gorgeous blonde walking right
          towards him. He stops in his track, quickly trying to decide
          how best to proceed.
          
          But as the blonde passes him he just stares at her like a
          deer in the headlights.
          
                                                                   40.
          
          
                              BLONDE
                    Don't look at me, I'm not attracted
                    to you.
          
          The blonde walks away. Mark stands on the sidewalk staring
          off into space, the wheels in his mind working overtime. Then
          it hits him.
          
                                MARK
                    Wait!
          
                              BLONDE
                    Don't bother. I've heard it all
                    before.
          
                              MARK
                        (BLURTING)
                    THE WORLD IS GOING TO END IF WE
                    DON'T HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW!
          
          Immediately the blonde's eyes well up in tears. She is
          terrified.
          
                              BLONDE
                    Do we have time to get to a motel
                    or do we have to do it right here?
          
          Mark is a caveman who just invented his penis.
          
          
          EXT. A MOTEL -- DAY
          
          The neon sign outside reads "A Cheap Motel for Intercourse
          with a Near Stranger".
          
          We slowly PUSH IN on the door of room 206. We hear noises
          inside that at first sound like moaning, but as we get
          closer... they sound more like crying.
          
          
          INT. MOTEL - ROOM 206 - DAY
          
          Bawling her eyes out and sitting on the bed doing her best to
          get her shoes off, is the hot blonde.
          
          Mark sits across from her, a look of guilt and revulsion on
          his face. This is not what he expected.
          
                              BLONDE
                        (BAWLING)
                    I'm sorry, I'm just so scared. I
                    don't want the world to end.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  41.
          
                              BLONDE (cont'd)
                    I don't want to die in this motel
                    room. I think I'm going to throw
                    up. Help me get my pants off.
          
          Mark stands up. The blonde grabs him and pulls him towards
          her. He pulls away.
          
                              MARK
                    This isn't right.
          
          The blonde screams and drops to her knees.
          
                              BLONDE
                    No! We have to have sex! The world
                    is going to end! Think of the
                    children and little babies!
          
          Mark looks down at this panicked, helpless girl and feels
          really, really bad about himself.
          
                              MARK
                    Just calm down for one second.
          
          Mark walks over to the phone and picks it up.
          
                              BLONDE
                    How can I be calm? The world might
                    end any second! DON'T YOU
                    UNDERSTAND?! WE'RE ALL GOING TO
                    DIE!!
          
                              MARK
                        (to phone)
                    Hello... NASA? Yes, it's... me. Oh,
                    good. That's very good news. Good
                    news indeed.
          
          Mark hangs up the phone. The blonde is rocking back and forth
          on the bed in a fetal position.
          
                              MARK
                    We're going to be okay. The world
                    isn't going to end. Everyone is
                    going to be fine.
          
          The blonde tackles him in a bear hug, sobbing and laughing.
          
                              BLONDE
                    WE'RE GOING TO LIVE! We're going to
                    live! Thank you! Thank you!
          
          The blonde falls onto the bed in exhaustion.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              BLONDE
                    This has been the worst... and the
                    best... day of my life.
          
                              MARK
                    Okay, I gotta go.
          
                              BLONDE
                    Oh no, please stay. We've been
                    through so much together.
          
          Mark stares at this helpless girl for a moment.
          
                              MARK
                    I'm an asshole.
          
          The blonde's face and mood do an instant 180.
          
                              BLONDE
                        (SPITEFUL)
                    Well, I hate assholes. Get out of
                    here.
          
          The blonde chucks her shoes at Mark as he closes the door.
          
          
          EXT. MOTEL -- DAY
          
          Mark walks across the parking lot. A look of total shock on
          his face.
          
          
          INT. BAR - DUSK
          
          Greg is in the exact same position Mark left him in, but he's
          twice as drunk.
          
          Mark plops down next to him, dazed and upset.
          
                              MARK
                    That was one of the worst
                    experiences of my life.
          
                              GREG
                        (SHIT-FACED)
                    Did you invent a new kind of bike?
          
                              MARK
                    What else would you do if you could
                    do anything in the world?
          
                              GREG
                    Bone chicks asses. That's what I'd
                    do.
          
                                                                    43.
          
          
                              MARK
                    What else though. What's the second
                    thing you'd do.
          
          Greg nods off. Mark nudges him.
          
                              GREG
                    What else would you do, dipshit?
          
                              MARK
                    I'd get money. I'd get all the
                    money.
          
          Greg passes out. Mark nods his head, takes the three full
          shots sitting in front of Greg and does them all.
          
                              MARK
                    Yeah. Let's do that. Greg, let's
                    go.
          
                              GREG
                    What?
          
                              MARK
                    We're going on a trip.
          
          Greg immediately perks up.
          
                              GREG
                    I'll drive.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S CAR -- NIGHT
          
          Greg is driving, Mark rides shotgun, both of them are
          completely plastered.
          
                              MARK
                    Thanks for driving man, I'm
                    completely plastered.
          
                              GREG
                    I'm just as hammered as you. But I
                    don't care if I get arrested. I'm
                    trying to hit bottom.
          
          WHOOP-WHOOP come the flashing lights of a cop car right
          behind them. Greg begins to pull over.
          
                              GREG
                    Here comes bottom.
          
          Mark looks worried. The cop comes to Greg's window.
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
                              COP
                    Nothing safer than pulling over two
                    nerdy white guys in their forties.
          
                              GREG
                    I don't want to go to jail.
          
                              COP
                    Are you drunk?
          
                                 GREG
                    Yes.
          
                              COP
                    Then you're going to jail.
                    Blow in here, son.
          
          The cop pulls out a Breathalyzer and holds it up to Greg's
          mouth.
          
                              MARK
                    Wait, officer. Don't do that.
          
                              COP
                    I don't think you can afford my
                    bribe, son.
          
                              MARK
                    How much does it cost to bribe you?
          
                              COP
                    At least five grand.
          
                              MARK AND GREG
                    Wow, that's high.
          
                              COP
                    I need to feel that I've got some
                    sense of integrity.
          
          Greg blows in the Breathalyzer.
          
                              COP
                    Whoa, that's off the charts. Step
                    out of the car, son. You're drunk
                    and going to jail.
          
          Greg opens the door.
          
                              MARK
                    Wait.
                        (PAUSE)
                    He's not drunk.
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          Greg stumbles and falls, passing out in the dirt. The cop
          stares at Mark for a long beat while his brain wraps around
          this.
          
                                 COP
                    Oh.
          
          The cop bangs his Breathalyzer against his leg.
          
                              COP
                    Damn thing must be broken.
          
          In the background we can hear Greg vomiting profusely. The
          cop picks up Greg and puts him back in the driver's seat.
          
                              COP
                        (to Greg)
                    Son, you might want to drive
                    yourself to the nearest hospital.
                    You have food poisoning or some
                    kind of flu.
          
          Mark is basically passed out, vomit drooling down his chin.
          He couldn't look more drunk. The cop and Mark stare at him
          for a beat.
          
                              COP
                        (to Mark)
                    Maybe you oughta drive, son.
          
                                 MARK
                    Good idea.
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Driving away with Greg in the passenger seat, a giant smile
          comes across Mark's face as he begins to laugh.
          
                              MARK
                    That was awesome!
          
                              GREG
                    Stop laughing, I'm sick.
          
                              MARK
                    You're gonna be all right, Greg.
          
                                 GREG
                    Oh good!
          
          Greg vomits all over himself.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
                              GREG
                    Stupid stomach flu.
                        (PAUSE)
                    Where are we going?
          
                              MARK
                    Vegas, baby. Vegas.
          
          
          EXT. BELLAGIO - NIGHT
          
          Mark pulls in front of the Bellagio hotel and casino. Both
          Mark, and a very hungover looking Greg, pop out of the car.
          Mark hands the keys to the valet and they both stumble
          inside.
          
          
          INT. BELLAGIO - NIGHT
          
          It's the Bellagio. We've all been there.
          
                              GREG
                    What are we doing here? We don't
                    have any money to throw away.
          
                              MARK
                    Sure we do.
          
          Mark pulls out a small wad of money.
          
                              GREG
                    What is that, a few hundred bucks?
                    That's not going to last us very
                    long.
          
                              MARK
                    Sure it will.
          
          Mark and Greg step up to the chip counter. Mark slides his
          small wad through the window.
          
                              MARK
                    Chips please.
          
          The CHIP WOMAN looks at his money.
          
                              CHIP WOMAN
                    There's a very good chance you'll
                    lose all this money here tonight.
          
                              MARK
                    I know.
          
                                                                  47.
          
          
                              CHIP WOMAN
                    And even if you do happen to win,
                    there's an even better chance that
                    in the long run we'll win it back.
          
                              MARK
                    I know.
          
                              CHIP WOMAN
                    Some of the games are fixed. Like
                    all the ones that use computers.
          
                              MARK
                    I know.
          
          The woman slides him a short stack of chips. Greg frowns.
          Mark and Greg walk towards the tables.
          
          Mark and Greg look around. A cocktail waitress approaches.
          
                              COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                    If I could be a stripper I would,
                    but I'm not attractive enough.
                    Drinks, guys?
          
                              GREG
                    No. I have a stomach flu.
          
                              MARK
                    We'll both have beers and we'll
                    take them at that roulette table
                    over there.
          
          Mark points to a table and walks away. The waitress nods.
          
                              GREG
                    Oh come on, roulette is the
                    stupidest game of them all. It's
                    pure chance, no skill whatsoever.
          
                              MARK
                    It's okay. I'm feeling lucky.
          
                               GREG
                    You've never had a lucky day in
                    your life.
          
                              MARK
                    Just watch.
          
          They arrive at the roulette table.
          
                                                                  48.
          
          
                              ROULETTE DEALER
                    Get your bets in, get your bets in.
                    The house always wins in the long
                    run. Because of the zero's on the
                    board every bet is slightly favored
                    towards the house.
          
          Mark puts his chips down on seventeen black. The dealer
          starts the wheel. The ball comes to a stop on twenty-seven
          red.
          
                              ROULETTE DEALER
                    Twenty-seven red. No one wins.
          
          In full view, Mark slides his chips over to twenty-seven red.
          
                              MARK
                    I'm on twenty-seven red.
          
          The dealer looks at this. His brain takes a moment to
          respond.
          
                              ROULETTE DEALER
                    We have a winner. Congratulations,
                    sir.
          
          The dealer stacks up Mark's new chips and pushes them over to
          him.
          
                              GREG
                    You did it. You just, like,
                    quadrupled your money. You lucky
                    son of a bitch.
          
                              MARK
                    That's nothing. Watch this.
          
          Mark puts all of his chips on double zero. A bunch of other
          people scatter their chips around the table as well.
          
                              ROULETTE DEALER
                    Get your bets in, get your bets in.
                    The house always wins in the long
                    run. Fork over your money right
                    here folks. I say this so often I
                    want to kill myself.
          
          The dealer spins the ball. It comes to a halt on nine black.
          
                              ROULETTE DEALER
                    Nine black. No winners.
          
                                                                  49.
          
          
          Mark takes ALL of the chips on the table, both his and
          EVERYONE ELSE'S and slides them together into a giant pile
          and sits them right on nine black.
          
                              MARK
                    I'm on nine black. These are all
                    mine.
          
          The table cheers for Mark. Some people are a bit confused,
          and a slight hubbub arises in the background: "I thought I
          had chips on the table." "Yeah, me too." "We must be drunk."
          "That guys is lucky!" Even the dealer looks a bit confused...
          but gets over it quickly.
          
                              ROULETTE DEALER
                    Nine black wins. Big winner.
                    Congratulations, sir.
          
          The roulette dealer slides about five grand in chips over to
          Mark. Greg's jaw is on the floor.
          
                              GREG
                    Do it again.
          
          Mark notices the confused people around him.
          
                              MARK
                    I don't think I should. Lets go
                    play slots.
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Mark is talking to a Pit Man right in front of a slot
          machine.
          
                              MARK
                    Hi, I just won a major jackpot on
                    this slot machine but no money came
                    out.
          
                              PIT MAN
                    I'm sorry about that, sir. Let me
                    get that fixed for you. And can I
                    say congratulations, sir.
          
                                 MARK
                    Thank you.
          
          The Pit Man whispers a few words into his lapel mic.
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          Mark and Greg, each carrying four giant buckets overflowing
          with chips, waddle through the casino.
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
                              GREG
                    This is the most amazing night of
                    my life.
          
          
          INT. BELLAGIO - PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY
          
          Mark and Greg lounge around the Bellagio penthouse suite,
          piles of chips and cash lying around them. Greg is pacing
          delightedly. Mark lies on the couch, unsatisfied.
          
                              GREG
                    It amazes me the winning streak
                    you're on. You must be the luckiest
                    man in the world.
          
                              MARK
                    Well, sort of.
          
                              GREG
                    It was like we couldn't lose.
          
                              MARK
                    We couldn't lose.
          
                              GREG
                    Do you have a system?
          
                              MARK
                    I've got a system.
          
                              GREG
                    Well, with your system in just a
                    few weeks I figure we could be the
                    richest people in the world.
          
                              MARK
                    And then what?
          
                              GREG
                    Well, here's what I'm thinking. We
                    take all the money in the world...
                    and put it on black.
          
                              MARK
                    Why put it on black? Why stop
                    there? Put it on a number and get
                    thirty five times back.
          
          Greg's eyes widen at the thought.
          
                              GREG
                    That's exactly what we'll do.
          
                                                          51.
          
          
                              MARK
                    Hold on, I think I found a flaw in
                    your plan. How can they pay us if
                    we have all the money in the world?
          
                              GREG
                    Well, they'd just have to.
          
                              MARK
                    Well, they can't because we've got
                    it all.
          
                              GREG
                    Well, they'd better find it. They
                    can't let us bet if they're not
                    going to pay us back. They'll have
                    to just give us the casino.
          
                              MARK
                    We already own the casino. We've
                    got all the money in the world.
                    We'll be betting against ourselves.
          
                              GREG
                    Then we'll go to another casino.
          
                              MARK
                    We own that one too. We won that.
          
                              GREG
                    So we own all the casino's?
          
                              MARK
                    Yup.
          
                              GREG
                    And if we win we can't pay us back
                    because we already have all the
                    money?
          
                              MARK
                    Yes.
          
          Greg thinks this over for a long beat.
          
                              GREG
                    Only one thing we can do then.
          
                              MARK
                    I'm listening.
          
                              GREG
                    Take ourselves into the back room
                    and break our own fingers.
          
                                                                  52.
          
          
                                 MARK
                    Brilliant.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - MORNING
          
          Mark, exhausted from his long night, waits for the elevator
          to arrive. The elevator doors open and Frank, the depressive
          neighbor, steps out.
          
                              MARK
                    Hey there, Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    Mark. How's it going?
          
                              MARK
                    Pretty good, thanks.
          
          Frank stops and turns around, this is a different response.
          
                                 FRANK
                    Really?
          
                                 MARK
                    Yeah. You?
          
                              FRANK
                    Awful. I was doing some internet
                    research last night about
                    suffocation suicide. I'm probably
                    going to give that a try tonight.
          
                                 MARK
                    Oh.
                        (PAUSE)
                    All right. Bye, Frank.
          
                                 FRANK
                    Bye.
          
          Mark gets in the elevator, Frank walks away. A short beat.
          Mark exits the elevator and yells after Frank.
          
                                 MARK
                    Frank!
          
          Frank, halfway out the building, turns around.
          
                                 FRANK
                    Yeah?
          
                              MARK
                    Don't do it.
          
                                                                  53.
          
          
          Frank thinks this over.
          
                               FRANK
                    Why not? I'm miserable. And no one
                    will care.
          
                                 MARK
                    I'll care.
          
                              FRANK
                    You're a loser, though.
          
                              MARK
                    Don't do it, Frank. Things are
                    going to be all right.
          
                                 FRANK
                    They are?
          
                              MARK
                    Yes. You're going to meet someone
                    soon. You won't be so lonely.
                    Things are going to turn around at
                    your job.
          
                              FRANK
                    My job's actually fine.
          
                              MARK
                    Well, things are going to get
                    better. Better than they are.
          
                              FRANK
                    What about the depression?
          
                              MARK
                    It will go away very soon. You're
                    going to be happy soon, Frank. You
                    just need to wait for it. Listen to
                    me: you don't need to kill
                    yourself.
          
          Something changes in Frank. A slight smile comes over him.
          
                                 FRANK
                    Really?
          
                                 MARK
                    Really.
          
          Frank laughs.
          
                                                                  54.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Wow. Man, and that suffocation
                    thing really seemed like a good
                    idea.
          
                                 MARK
                    It wasn't.
          
                              FRANK
                    Okay. Well, my night's open now.
                    You want to hang out later?
          
                              MARK
                    I don't know. Not really.
          
          Frank's smile fades a tiny bit.
          
                              MARK
                    Sure. Of course. Let's hang out.
          
                              FRANK
                    I'll see you after work.
          
                                 MARK
                    Great.
          
          Mark gets back in the elevator to the sound of Frank laughing
          to himself as he exits the building. We hold on Mark for a
          moment as he smiles and nods his head.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Mark sits at kitchen table, pen and paper in hand.
          
                              MARK (V.O.)
                        (WRITING)
                    I've discovered something today
                    very important... and very
                    powerful.
          
          MONTAGE
          
          Mark doing various good deeds throughout the day. V.O plays
          throughout.
          
          Marks walks up to the homeless man with the "I don't
          understand why I'm homeless and you are all not" sign. He
          says something to the homeless man, who quickly drops his
          sign and follows Mark.
          
                              MARK (V.O.)
                    I'm as excited as I've ever been in
                    my entire life, and equally scared.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  55.
          
                              MARK (V.O.) (cont'd)
                    I'm writing this down in a letter
                    in case this thing I've discovered
                    somehow ends up killing me. I want
                    to ensure that, even if I wasn't
                    strong enough to use it, that my
                    invention doesn't once again
                    disappear, never to be discovered
                    again.
          
          Mark and the homeless man are at the bank. Mark is talking to
          the bank teller. The homeless man looks at Mark nervously.
          The teller leaves and comes back with stacks and stacks of
          cash.
          
                              MARK (V.O.)
                    In just a few hours since I
                    stumbled upon my discovery I have
                    seen its potential for evil and I
                    have seen its potential for good.
          
          Outside Lecture Films, Mark talks to the woman who was
          adamant about not wanting to go to work. He whispers a few
          words into her ear. She smiles, picks up her briefcase and
          gladly walks into work.
          
                              MARK (V.O.)
                    I must be careful with my
                    discovery, for at this point I
                    barely understand it, let alone
                    think I have the power to control
                    it. All I know is that if I'm not
                    careful I could easily do
                    irreparable damage to the world, or
                    even cause my own premature death.
          
          Mark walks up to the arguing couple at the coffee shop, who
          are now sitting at different tables, not even looking at each
          other. He pulls up a chair next to each of them,
          individually, and says a few words to them. Within moments,
          the two of them are running into each other's arms and making
          out passionately on the floor of the coffee shop.
          
                              MARK (V.O.)
                    Now, to explain my invention. In
                    essence, my creation is the act of
                    saying words that simply are not.
                    For example, if I tell someone that
                    my eyes are blue, then it simply
                    becomes fact. I still know that,
                    indeed, my eyes are brown, but no
                    one else is aware of this fact, so
                    therefore I have blue eyes.

                              MARK (V.O.) (cont'd)
                    It's a game of numbers: there is
                    only one of me who knows I have
                    brown eyes, and so many of them who
                    do not. The numbers always win.
          
          Mark is at the elderly home, walking the halls and whispering
          to his grandmother and each elderly person he passes, leaving
          each one of them with a smile upon their faces, and some with
          tears streaming down their cheeks.
          
                              MARK
                    Whoever is reading this, go ahead
                    and try it. Tell someone your eyes
                    are a different color then they
                    are. I think you'll be amazed at
                    the results. It's so simple and
                    yet... so powerful... this thing
                    I've invented.
          
          Mark and Frank are watching TV in Mark's apartment. The two
          of them are drinking beers and having a good time watching
          television.
          
                              MARK (V.O.)
                    Au Revoir, future reader, au
                    revoir.
          
          Mark signs his letter, seals it in an envelope, writes "MY
          INVENTION" on the outside of it and sticks it in a drawer in
          his kitchen.

          INT. MARK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mark lies in bed watching TV. He picks up the phone and
          dials.
          
                              MARK
                    Jennifer. It's Mark.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Are you gonna hang up on me again?
          
                              MARK
                    No. Maybe. Who knows. I'm calling
                    because I want to ask you out on
                    another date.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Why would you do that?
          
                                                            57.
          
          
                              MARK
                    I discovered something yesterday. I
                    found out I can pretty much have my
                    life anyway I want it from now on.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Congratulations. I gotta go.
          
                              MARK
                    Wait, and I know you said you
                    didn't want to date me ever again,
                    but I'm different now. Things have
                    changed. I think I'm in your league
                    now.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    You're better looking?
          
                              MARK
                    No. I'm not better looking. I'm
                    just more... powerful. I think you
                    have to see it for yourself.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Have you been to the gym?
          
                              MARK
                    No, I haven't been to the gym. It's
                    just... it's amazing. Things are
                    different for me now. You have to
                    see this. I think you'll hardly
                    recognize me.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Did you buy better clothes?
          
                              MARK
                    No, look can we just meet up?
          
          There is silence on the other end of the phone.
          
                              MARK
                    Jennifer, If there was even a
                    glimmer of something about me that
                    you liked, please say yes. You even
                    admitted that we got along well.
                    Just give me one more chance. Just
                    one little teensy, tiny date.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Okay, fine.
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
                              MARK
                    Fantastic. Tomorrow night. I'll
                    pick you up at eight.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Most likely it'll be our last date
                    though, so just know that.
          
                              MARK
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    That's very sweet.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    No it wasn't. Did you not hear what
                    I said?
          
                              MARK
                    Yeah, no I was being...
                        (pause; searching)
                    ...there's no word for it. See you
                    tomorrow night.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Bye.
          
          Mark hangs up happily.

          American man sitting before a fire in a green smoking jacket,
          holding a script.

                    Also, I will tell you all about my
                    personal misfortunes, such as my
                    wife who cheated on me with a man
                    named Perry.
          
          The screen reads: "The Industrial Revolution. Summer `07."
          
          BACK ON MARK: His eyes are wide. The wheels in his head are
          spinning again.
          
                              MARK
                    Rob Marlowe, your streak of success
                    has finally come to an end.
          
          Suddenly Mark jumps and runs to his kitchen table. He grabs a
          pen, pulls out a sheet of paper... and begins writing.
          
          SERIES OF JUMP CUTS: Mark writing furiously throughout the
          night, piling up page upon page. By the time the sun comes up
          Mark is exhausted, with barely the energy to keep his head up
          as he writes "the end" and places the final page on his large
          stack of finished pages.
          
                                                           FADE TO:
          
          
          EXT. LECTURE FILMS - CAR LOT - MORNING
          
          Mark hustles through the parking lot, manuscript in hand. He
          reaches the door and then stops -- remembering something.
          
          Mark runs to the curb and throws his manuscript onto the
          dirty, filthy street. He gets down on his hands and knees and
          rubs his manuscript into the grime, making sure to get every
          page equally filthy.
          
          Satisfied, he organizes the pages into a neat pile and enters
          Lecture Films.
          
          
          INT. LECTURE FILMS - WRITER'S OFFICES - DAY
          
          Mark walks the aisles of Lecture Films. People stop to stare
          at him. There is a whispered hubbub from the many cubicles
          and offices.
          
          Mark passes his old office, stopping to read the sign on the
          door: "14TH CENTURY -- CLOSED."
          
          Mark grimaces and keeps walking.
          
                              SHELLEY (O.S.)
                    He's gone crazy!
          
                                                                  60.
          
          
          Mark turns his head to see Shelley, standing down the hall,
          terrified, staring at Mark.
          
          Mark ignores her and keeps walking. Leaning against his door
          jamb, is Rob, smirking as Mark passes him.
          
                              ROB
                    Come to beg for your old job back?
                    Hey everybody, here's the loser who
                    thought the Black Plague would make
                    for an interesting film. Good luck,
                    douche bag. Freaking loser.
          
          Mark walks right up to the door that reads, "Head of
          Development -- Anthony James."
          
          Mark opens the door.
          
          Anthony is on the phone, his back to Mark.
          
                              ANTHONY (ON PHONE)
                    They're going to fire me any
                    moment, I just know it. I'm really,
                    really horrible at my job. I don't
                    know anything about movies. I don't
                    even like movies. I like sports.
                    Head of development, what does that
                    even mean? I'm not a smart person.
                    Okay, talk to you later.
          
          Anthony turns around to find Mark. His face becomes very,
          very scared.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    That was the head of the studio.
                        (PAUSE)
                    I'm very scared that you're mad at
                    me about the whole firing thing.
          
                              MARK
                    I'm not mad at all.
          
          Anthony is relieved.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    Oh good, because I feel really bad
                    about it. I mean, I would be
                    horrible at your job too. I would
                    be horrible at any job in this
                    place.
                        (PAUSE)
                    I love sports.
          
          They both stare at each other for a long beat.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
                              ANTHONY
                    Why are you here?
          
          Mark pulls up a chair.
          
                               MARK
                    When you fired me, I was very
                    depressed.
          
                                 ANTHONY
                    I knew it.
          
                              MARK
                    And so I left this building and I
                    just started walking. And I walked
                    all the way out of town. And then I
                    walked into the desert and I fell
                    asleep under a tree.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    I don't do well with other people's
                    life changing events.
          
                              MARK
                    And when I woke up I found this
                    strange old chest sticking out of
                    the ground. So I started digging.
                    And I unearthed a very old and
                    ancient box. Probably, oh...
                    about... seven hundred years old.
                    And inside the box...
                        (holding up manuscript)
                    ... was this.
          
          Mark places his muddy, dirty, manuscript down on Anthony's
          desk. Anthony is scared to touch it.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    What is it?
          
                              MARK
                    It's a never-before-heard
                    historical event from the past.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    When does it take place?
          
                              MARK
                    The 1300's.
          
          The excitement drains from Anthony's face.
          
                                                                   62.
          
          
                              ANTHONY
                    I told you we're not interested in
                    Black Plague movies here, Mark.
          
                              MARK
                    This one isn't about the black
                    plague. Well it isn't just about
                    the black plague. Let me read you
                    some of this.
          
          Anthony rolls his eyes.
          
                               MARK
                    Anthony, get excited about this.
                    This is a brand new event from
                    history that no one has ever heard
                    before. It's a great human
                    discovery.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    Yeah, but is there a movie there?
          
                              MARK
                    The greatest movie Lecture Films
                    has ever made.
          
          Anthony's eyes widen.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    Start reading.
          
          Mark picks up the manuscript and opens the first page.
          
                              MARK
                        (READING)
                    On the very first day of the
                    fourteenth century, a momentous
                    occasion occurred. It began as a
                    day much like any other. The sun
                    rose, the people awoke, workers
                    began to work, babies began to cry.
                    But all of that was interrupted
                    when a giant flying space ship
                    crashed down from the skies and
                    landed in the heart of Babylon.
          
          Anthony's mouth drops to the ground.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    What?!
          
          Mark smiles. Anthony picks up his phone and presses
          "intercom".
          
                                                                    63.
          
          
                              ANTHONY (ON PHONE)
                    I want everyone in here now! We've
                    got a BIG ONE.
          
          Anthony hangs up.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    Please, Mark. Continue.
          
                              MARK
                        (READING)
                    As the smoke cleared, the door to
                    the spaceship opened and inside,
                    were hundreds of beautiful, half
                    naked alien women.
          
                                                          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          The room is filled with people now, all of them hanging on
          every word Mark reads from his manuscript. Even Rob and
          Shelly lean against the back wall, their minds blown by the
          story Mark is telling.
          
                              MARK
                        (READING)
                    And then the ninja army unleashed a
                    giant fireball that brought the
                    robot dinosaur to its knees, saving
                    Mars, Earth and the Nude Amazonian
                    Alien Women all in one sweeping
                    motion. The earth was saved.
                    Jebediah and Aleena were allowed to
                    marry by alien king Xardon. It was
                    to be the First Human-Nude
                    Amazonian Alien Woman wedding, and
                    no expenses would be spared. All of
                    Babylon and Mars were invited to
                    join in the celebrations.
          
          People around the room wipe tears from their eyes.
          
                              MARK
                        (READING)
                    The wedding was held on a brisk
                    summers day on Mars, with all of
                    the survivors of the Great Ninja
                    War and the Black Plague present.
                    They feasted and danced and laughed
                    and it was a joyous occasion.

                              MARK (cont'd)
                    The moment the bride and groom
                    kissed, King Xardon performed a
                    mind-wipe on all of the humans,
                    thereby erasing all knowledge of
                    these events from their minds, and
                    sent them back to Babylon. For
                    seven hundred years these events
                    would be forgotten by mankind until
                    one day, a great writer by the name
                    of Mark Bellison, would stumble
                    upon them in the desert, after
                    being fired by his shit boss
                    Anthony and mocked by Rob and
                    Shelly, two huge douche bags.
                    Lecture Films Motion Picture
                    Studios would go on to make the
                    picture and it would be a big
                    success, and Mark would become very
                    wealthy and famous from it. The
                    End.
          
          The entire room bursts into applause. Not just normal
          applause, but massive, epic applause.
          
          Everyone crowds around Mark, hugging him, touching him, blown
          away by the magnanimity of the moment.
          
                              ANTHONY
                    Mark, tell us what it's called.
          
          Mark thinks it over for a moment and looks right at Rob.
          
                              MARK
                        (to Rob)
                    The Black Plague.
          
          Rob sneers. Everyone "aahs" and claps again.
          
          
          INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Mark and Jennifer sit at a candlelit table in the corner of a
          hip and fancy restaurant. Jennifer looks beautiful. Mark is
          on cloud nine.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Congratulations on selling your
                    script today.
          
                              MARK
                    Thanks. Thank you for having dinner
                    with me.
          
                                                                  65.
          
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Everyone needs to eat.
                        (PAUSE)
                    And I enjoy your company.
          
          Mark smiles. They both sip their drinks and look at their
          menus. The waiter comes up.
          
                              WAITER
                    I'm an extremely important waiter.
                        (PAUSE)
                    What can I get you?
          
                              MARK
                    I don't want to know what it is, I
                    just want to order the most
                    expensive thing on the menu.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'll have the duck. And I think you
                    look like a little rat faced man.
          
                              WAITER
                    Okay, I'll have those right up for
                    you.
          
          The waiter leaves. Mark and Jennifer stare at each other for
          a short beat. Something has changed between them and they can
          both feel it.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Things seem to be turning around
                    for you.
          
                              MARK
                    Today is the best day of my life.
                    Hands down. Easy. Best day.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    It's not every day you unearth a
                    monumental historical event and
                    sell it for a ton of money.
          
                               MARK
                    That wasn't the best part. It was
                    great, but it wasn't the peak of my
                    day.
                         (PAUSE)
                    I've had a crush on you ever since
                    I saw a picture of you on Greg's
                    refrigerator two years ago.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Oh.
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
                              MARK
                    The best part of my day today is
                    right now, sitting at this table
                    here with you.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Oh.
          
                              MARK
                    You're the most beautiful woman
                    I've ever seen in my life, and
                    you're special... and it makes me
                    happy to be around you.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Thank you.
          
          Jennifer is touched...but she doesn't reciprocate Mark's
          feelings. Jennifer moves on.
          
                               JENNIFER
                    Tell me something about your
                    family. I really don't know much
                    about you.
          
                              MARK
                    Ah, my family. We're what you'd
                    probably call "not lucky". My whole
                    family is kind of marked by
                    tragedy, bad luck and general...
                    shittiness. It goes back a long
                    ways and could probably drive
                    someone to suicide just hearing
                    about it, so I'll keep it simple.
                    My mom died when I was six. Cancer.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Sad.
          
                              MARK
                    And my dad got real depressed and
                    lost his job. Out of work and with
                    a kid to raise he had no choice but
                    to turn to a life of crime.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    What kind of crime?
          
                              MARK
                    He was a robber. Houses mostly.

          Nice, mid-to-upper class home. Lots of white wood. The house
          is very quiet, until... the phone rings and the answer
          machine picks up.
          
                              MARK'S DAD (O.S.)
                        (on answer machine)
                    Hi, I'm calling to let you know
                    I'll be robbing your house today.
                    I'll probably be there within the
                    hour.
                        (PAUSE)
                    I hope you're not there.
          
          The message ends. PAN OVER to a SOCCER MOM standing in the
          doorway. She drops her coffee and screams.

                    He was a very unlucky man. He spent
                    his last days behind bars. I never
                    really knew him.
                        (sad moment; pause)
                    But I guess I've also had a little
                    luck in my life. I did have a
                    wonderful grandmother who raised
                    me.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Oh, that's sweet.

                    Old person's home obviously. Who
                    wants to live with that? Gross.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I know, right?
          
                              MARK
                    But I'm going to get her out of
                    there tomorrow.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  68.
          
                              MARK (cont'd)
                    I'm going to buy her a big
                    beautiful mansion where she can
                    spend her few remaining days in
                    luxury.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    That's nice.
          
          The waiter arrives with their food.
          
                              WAITER
                    I don't know what's wrong with the
                    chef today, but these just look
                    awful.
          
          He places them down.
          
                              MARK
                    They look fine to me.
          
                              WAITER
                    Well, you're stupid.
          
          Mark and Jennifer begin eating. Mark wants to say something
          and takes a moment to summon the courage.
          
                              MARK
                    Right. I was thinking that since
                    I'm going to be rich and successful
                    now that I might be in your league.
                        (PAUSE)
                    And that maybe we could be
                    together. Romantically.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    What would be the point?
          
          Mark didn't expect this answer.
          
                              MARK
                    Well, I don't know, maybe we might
                    enjoy it. Maybe we'd be good
                    together and could have a happy
                    life, raise a family together.
          
          Jennifer thinks this over.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Well, I do like you. And I enjoy
                    your company.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  69.
          
                              JENNIFER (cont'd)
                    And if we were to get together and
                    procreate I would like the
                    offspring that are carrying half my
                    genetic code to be well taken care
                    of and financially stable. I also
                    think you'd make a good father and
                    a good husband, which I like.
          
          Mark smiles. This is going well...
          
                              MARK
                    Good. Fantastic.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Unfortunately, none of that changes
                    the fact that you'd still be
                    contributing half of the genetic
                    code to our children.
                        (PAUSE)
                    I don't want short, fat kids with
                    little snub noses.
          
          And that's the end of that. Mark nods.
          
                              MARK
                    Sure.
          
          Mark takes a bite of his food. Jennifer smiles and does the
          same, oblivious to Mark's pain.
          
          Mark's cell phone rings.
          
                              MARK (ON PHONE)
                    Hello?
                        (PAUSE)
                    What?
          
          Mark's face melts in terror.
          
                              MARK (ON PHONE)
                        (LOUDLY)
                    WHAT?
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
          
          Mark bursts into the hospital room to find his grandmother,
          MARTHA looking tired and scared, hooked up to dozens of
          machines, the heart monitor beeping ominously.
          
                              MARK
                    Grandma, they just called me.
                    What's going on? Are you okay?
          
                                                            70.
          
          
                              MARTHA
                    I don't know, I fell on my way back
                    to my room.
          
                              MARK
                    What do the doctors say?
          
                              MARTHA
                    They say I'll probably die tonight.
          
                              MARK
                    What?
          
          There's a knock on the door. The doctor enters.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Oh, hello. I was just coming in to
                    check on her, you must be Martha
                    Bellison's grandson.
          
                              MARK
                    What are you talking about she's
                    going to die?
          
                              DOCTOR
                    I'm sorry. It just doesn't look
                    good. She's suffered a major heart
                    attack and her heart is very weak,
                    her pulse not very strong, her
                    blood pressure is dropping rapidly
                    and most likely she'll have a fatal
                    heart attack during the night.
          
                              MARK
                    Fuck.
          
          The doctor checks Martha's chart.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Yup, still going to die.
          
          Mark sits down next to Martha, in total shock.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    I'm sorry, guys. I wish I felt
                    something for you two, but I really
                    don't. I do this exact thing about
                    thirty times a night and it's
                    really hardened me to human
                    suffering. On a side note, it's
                    fajita night at the cafeteria
                    downstairs. You might think about
                    grabbing a bite to eat there after
                    your grandma dies.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
          The doctor leaves. Mark holds his grandmother's hand, her
          hand is shaking.
          
                              MARTHA
                    I'm so scared, Mark. I don't want
                    to die. You know, people don't talk
                    about it much, but death is a
                    horrible thing. One minute you're
                    alive, there's a whole world around
                    you, humming and jumping, people
                    coming in and out, doors opening
                    and closing, love and anger and the
                    whole mess of it all, and then like
                    that, it's all gone.
                        (CRYING)
                    This is it Mark, only a few hours
                    left of this until an eternity of
                    nothingness.
          
          The wheels in Mark's head are spinning again. Suddenly the
          heart monitor starts beating rapidly and Martha lurches in
          pain.
          
                               MARK
                    Grandma!
          
          Mark immediately slams on the big red "call nurse" button,
          holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain.
          
          Seconds later three nurses burst into the room.
          
                              NURSE #1
                    She's seizing.
          
          Nurse #2 begins filling a syringe. Mark sits by his
          grandmother's head, they're both looking right at each other.
          
                              MARTHA
                    I'm scared.
          
                              MARK
                    Listen closely to me, Grandma. I
                    have a surprise for you.
          
          We focus on Mark and his grandmother, inches from one another
          as the paramedics busy themselves around Martha's dying body.
          
                              MARK
                    You're wrong about what happens
                    when you die. It's not an eternity
                    of nothingness.
          
          Martha is hanging on to every word Mark is saying.
          
                                                                    72.
          
          
                              MARK
                    When you die you're going to go to
                    your favorite place in the whole
                    world. And you're going to be with
                    all of the people you've ever loved
                    and who have ever loved you. And
                    you're going to be young again, and
                    you'll be able to run through the
                    fields and dance and jump, and
                    there will be no sadness, no pain,
                    just love and laughing and
                    happiness. There will be ponies
                    made of gold, and everyone will
                    live in giant mansions, and
                    everything will smell like cookies.
                    And it will last for an eternity,
                    Grandma. An eternity.
          
          Tears are rolling down Martha's face as a glimmering smile
          overtakes her face.
          
          Mark looks up to see the nurses, paramedics and doctors all
          staring at Mark in total shock.
          
                              NURSE #1
                    Go on.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    What else happens?
          
          The cardiogram flat lines.
          
                              MARK
                    Do your jobs!
          
          Everyone distractedly goes back to helping the grandmother.
          
                              MARK
                    You're going to be happy forever,
                    grandma. I promise you. Say hello
                    to my mom for me. Tell her I love
                    her.
          
          Again, everyone has stopped helping Martha, they're all
          listening intently. Some of them are crying.
          
                              NURSE #2
                        (TEARFULLY)
                    I'm going to see my mother again
                    when I die.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Tell us more, please.
          
                                                                    73.
          
          
          Martha stops breathing. The machine flatlines. And with that
          Martha is gone.
          
                                MARK
                    Damn it.
          
          Mark turns away from his grandmother. Standing outside in the
          hallway is Jennifer, watching Mark with true empathy in her
          eyes.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S CAR -- MORNING
          
          Mark and Jennifer pull up in front of Jennifer's apartment.
          There is a long beat of silence.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'm so sorry, Mark.
          
                              MARK
                    I think I just did something bad.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Do you want to come inside?
          
          Mark nods his head.
          
          
          INT. JENNIFER'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mark and Jennifer sit side-by-side on her couch. Mark holds a
          can of beer in his hand, gently turning it around in his
          palm, staring down at it vacantly.
          
          Jennifer sadly watches Mark.
          
          Slowly and almost absentmindedly, Jennifer's hand moves over
          and rests gently upon Mark's wrist, settling there.
          
          We hold on them for a long beat.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
                                                             FADE UP:
          
          THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Mark and Jennifer have fallen asleep in the exact same
          position, both of them sitting side-by-side no the couch, her
          hand still on his wrist.
          
          Mark opens his eyes and looks down at her hand, then up at
          Jennifer who slowly opens her eyes and smiles at him.
          
                                                                     74.
          
          
                                 JENNIFER
                    Hi.
          
                                 MARK
                    Hi.
          
          They share a moment.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S CAR - MORNING
          
          A bleary eyed Mark drives home from Jennifer's. As he turns
          onto his street he finds hundreds of cars blocking the way. A
          massive crowd of people are leaving their cars and walking.
          
          Mark gets out of his car to find a wild scene: hundreds of
          people camped out on the lawn of his apartment building.
          
          Standing by his door is the NURSE from the hospital. She
          immediately points at Mark and screams.
          
                              NURSE #1
                    There he is!
          
          Mark is bum-rushed by a question-asking throng. All of them
          are pelting Mark with questions, all of them confused and
          hopeful and desperately looking for answers.
          
                              PERSON #1
                    Is there only one place you go when
                    you die?
          
                              PERSON #2
                    Will everyone who has ever died be
                    there?
          
                              PERSON #3
                    What's this place called?
          
                              PERSON #4
                    Will I get to have sex with people
                    there?
          
          Mark pushes through the crowd, overwhelmed by it all. He gets
          to his door and opens it, only to have the Nurse step in his
          path and block the door.
          
                              NURSE #1
                    You owe us an explanation. If you
                    know something this important, you
                    better tell us all.
          
                              MARK
                    Who are you people?
          
                                                                  75.
          
          
                              NURSE #1
                    The words you spoke last night, to
                    your grandmother, spread like
                    wildfire. Please, tell us more.
                    Explain what you said.
          
                              MARK
                    Fine, fine, just give me a minute.
          
          Mark pushes past her and into his building, closing the door
          behind him.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Mark goes to his fridge and pulls out a beer. His mind is
          reeling. As he opens a drawer to get a bottle opener he sees
          the letter: "MY INVENTION". Mark eyes it ominously.
          
          The phone rings. Mark screens the call.
          
                              JENNIFER (V.O.)
                        (leaving message)
                    You've been gone for twenty minutes
                    and I turn on the T.V to see you on
                    every station. What's going on?
                    This is seriously the weirdest
                    thing...
          
          Mark picks up the phone.
          
                              MARK
                    Remember last night when I said I
                    think I did something bad? Well now
                    I know I did something bad.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    They're saying that you know
                    something different about what
                    happens after you die.
          
          Mark walks into his bedroom and turns on the TV. Sure enough
          there's a newscaster on his lawn, giving a report, with a
          banner on the screen that reads, "New Death Discoveries".
          
                               MARK
                    Hold on.
          
          Mark puts down the phone and listens to the T.V.
          
                              REPORTER (ON T.V)
                    Twenty-four hours ago, Mark
                    Bellison was just your typical
                    nobody writer.

                              REPORTER (ON T.V) (cont'd)
                    Today, people are saying he knows
                    new information about what happens
                    after you die.
          
          Mark puts the phone to his ear again.
          
                              MARK
                    Fuck.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Mark, what do you know? What did
                    you tell your grandmother last
                    night? What's going on?
          
                              MARK
                    I can't explain it all right now.
                    Why don't you come over?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Okay.
          
          
          EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON
          
          Jennifer pushes through the throng of people, which is now
          even larger than before. As she reaches the door Mark opens
          it for her and slides her through.
          
                              MARK
                    Come up quick, they look like they
                    could get out of hand any second.
          
          Mark hurries Jennifer into the elevator.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Jennifer sits on the couch while Mark, agitated beyond
          recognition, paces the room.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Just tell me what you told your
                    grandmother.
          
                              MARK
                    I don't think I should. Who knows
                    what could happen next? I'm just
                    going to keep my mouth shut from
                    now on.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    What you said obviously affected a
                    lot of people. I don't think you
                    have the choice to keep it in now.
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
                              MARK
                    Sure I do. I could just walk out
                    that door and get on a plane and go
                    to Namibia. No one knows me in
                    Namibia.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Just tell me what you said. Please,
                    Mark.
          
                              MARK
                    My grandmother was dying, and she
                    was terrified, shaking all over.
                    She didn't want to just become
                    nothingness. So I told her that
                    when she died there wouldn't be
                    nothingness. That she would be with
                    all of the people she loved who had
                    died and that she would live an
                    eternity of joy and happiness.
          
          Jennifer's heart skips a beat.
          
                              JENNIFER
                        (barely able to speak)
                    How do you know these things?
          
          Mark sighs and looks out the window. The crowd extends down
          the block, all of them sitting calmly on his lawn, talking
          quietly to each other, trying to make sense of it all.
          
          Jennifer gets up and stands beside Mark.
          
                               JENNIFER
                    You have to tell them everything
                    you know. This is too big. You have
                    no choice.
          
                              MARK
                    But you don't understand. The words
                    I said... they weren't... it's not
                    right.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    How did your grandmother feel when
                    you told her these things?
          
                              MARK
                    Happy. At peace.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    And how did that make you feel?
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
                              MARK
                    Good.
          
                              JENNIFER
                        (sweeping her hand over
                         the crowd)
                    Think how good it will feel to do
                    the same for all of these people.
          
          Mark thinks this over.
          
                              MARK
                    Okay. But I need a few hours to get
                    my thoughts together.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'll go tell them.
          
                              MARK
                    Wait! Are you sure this is right?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Of course it is. You know something
                    that's going to change mankind
                    forever. It's the most important
                    thing the world has ever heard.
          
          Jennifer leaves the room. Mark, alone with his thoughts, sits
          down at his kitchen table, pulls out a few sheets of paper,
          grabs a pen and starts writing.
          
                                                          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Mark's neighborhood is a sea of candles. The crowd has grown
          beyond measure. A massive sea of people, all holding candles,
          all waiting quietly like serene cows for Mark to come down
          and make his announcement.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mark is hunched over his table writing. There's a knock at
          the front door. Greg walks in with a large pizza and beer.
          
                              GREG
                    I brought pizza. How come you never
                    told me we all get mansions?
          
                              MARK
                    I didn't...
          
                                                                  79.
          
          
          Jennifer comes out of the bedroom and quickly "shhh's" Greg.
          
                              GREG
                    Inventing the bicycle is one thing,
                    but this...
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Shut up. Let him work.
          
          Jennifer pulls Greg away from Mark. Mark goes back to work.
          
          TIME CUT: LATER
          
          Mark puts down his pencil and places both written sheets next
          to each other. He has finished.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mark opens the door. Jennifer and Greg are on his bed
          watching T.V. The same newscaster stands outside the
          building.
          
                              NEWSCASTER (ON T.V)
                    In Seoul Korea, they wait. In Rome,
                    Italy, they wait. In London,
                    England, they wait. In New York
                    City, they wait. The world has come
                    to a standstill, everyone at their
                    televisions and radios, or here on
                    this lawn, waiting for Mark
                    Bellison to come forth and tell the
                    people what he knows.
          
          Mark waves his manuscript in the air.
          
                                MARK
                    I'm done.
          
          Jennifer and Greg jumps off the bed.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Are you ready?
          
                                MARK
                    I guess.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          They head towards the door.

                               MARK
                    I feel like I should be reading
                    these off of something other than
                    just notebook paper. I wish they
                    were like, written on large tablets
                    or even just nicer paper or
                    something.
          
          Greg grabs an empty pizza box off of the counter, rips it
          into two pieces and tapes his two pages onto them.
          
          Mark holds the two halves of the pizza boxes awkwardly and
          nods his head.
          
                              MARK
                    Feels better.
          
          Mark looks at Jennifer and Greg with fear in his eyes.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Just tell them what you know
          
                              GREG
                    Good luck out there, man.
          
          
          EXT. MARK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          OTS of Newscaster cameraman. The newscaster is interviewing a
          young man, with Mark's apartment building in the background.
          
                              YOUNG MAN
                    I heard that he said we all get
                    mansions, and that there's even
                    ponies.
          
                              NEWSCASTER
                        (to cameraman)
                    Ponies. Mansions. Ice Cream. These
                    are the things we can all expect
                    when we die. What else can we
                    expect? We won't know until Mark
                    Bellison steps out of that...
          
                              YOUNG MAN
                        (SHOUTING)
                    THERE HE IS!
          
          Mark cracks open the front door and steps out onto his front
          steps, with Jennifer right behind him. The newscaster and
          cameraman run to get into position.
          
          Mark looks out at the sea of people staring silently at him,
          waiting for answers.
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
                              MARK
                    Hello.
          
          A man runs up and hands Mark a microphone.
          
                              MARK
                    Oh, thanks.
          
          His voice echoes through the neighborhood.
          
                              MARK
                    Wow.
          
          You could hear a pin drop. No one is even breathing.
          
                              MARK
                    So. I guess you've all heard the
                    things I told my grandmother last
                    night and... I understand why
                    you're here.
                        (PAUSE)
                    I know... some things. Some very
                    important things. And I'm going to
                    share these things with you now.
          
          Intercut throughout: different video feeds, people listening
          to radios, standing in the cold watching TV's through store
          windows -- all around the world.
          
          Mark takes a deep breath and holds up his "pizza box
          commandments".
          
                              MARK
                    Everything you want to know is
                    written here. On this old pizza
                    box.
          
          Mark looks out at the crowd, all of them so hopeful, so
          needy. Mark looks back at Jennifer and Greg who give him a
          proud nod.
          
                              MARK
                        (READING)
                    Number one: There is a man who
                    lives in the sky who controls
                    everything. Number two...
          
                              MAN #1
                        (interrupting; shouting)
                    Whoa, whoa whoa. What does he look
                    like?
          
          Mark wasn't prepared for questions.
          
                                                          82.

                        (STRUGGLING)
                    Tall. Big hands. A good head of
                    hair.
          
                              WOMAN #1
                    What ethnicity is he?
          
                              MARK
                        (making it up as he goes)
                    He's a new ethnicity. It's like a
                    mix of all of our ethnicities.
          
                              MAN #2
                    Does he live on a cloud?
          
                              MAN #3
                    Can we see him?
          
                              MARK
                        (becoming confident)
                    No. He lives much higher than the
                    clouds, too high to see.
          
                              WOMAN #2
                    So he lives in space?
          
                              MARK
                    No, not that high.
          
                              MAN #3
                    So you mean the Thermosphere?
          
                              MARK
                    Look, people I got a lot to get
                    through here. I'm just telling you
                    what I know: Man. Lives in the sky.
                    You can't see him. Controls
                    everything. Cool?
          
          Everyone nods.
          
                              MARK
                    Number two: When you die you don't
                    disappear into an eternity of
                    nothingness. Instead, you go to a
                    really great place.
                        (PAUSE)
                    Number three: In that place every
                    person will get a mansion.
          
                              MAN #4
                    What kind of mansion?

                    Oh no! I wasn't thinking of a
                    mansion!
          
          A lot of people echo this sentiment.
          
                              MAN #5
                    Shit! I was thinking of a horrible

                    Yes, of course. Everyone gets a

          you'll never see them. They're far
          off, too far for you to get there.

          But what if they try to find me?

          They won't. They hate you too.
          
                    WOMAN #4
          But what if they don't? What if
          they love me but I hate them?

          Number five: When you die there
          will be free ice cream. All day.

          think of.

          can think of.

                    That also is fine. Unless the dog
                    dies. Then it's bad.
          
                              MAN #1
                    If you do just one bad thing do you
                    go to the bad place?
          
                              MARK
                    No. You get...

                    ... three chances. If you do three
                    bad things you're out.

                    Kind of, yes.
          
          There's a hubbub throughout the crowd: "It's like baseball",
          "I love baseball" "I'm scared of the bad place".
          
                                MARK
                    Any more?
          
          About fifty people stand up and ask their questions at the
          same time.

          Mark sighs.

                    No. There's no hairstyle that will
                    put you in the bad place. Like I've
                    told you, the main things are
                    hurting people physically on
                    purpose, taking people's stuff,
                    doing things to people they don't
                    want done, killing people on
                    purpose. Okay? Are we good?
          
          The crowd nods apprehensively. Many of the people in the
          crowd are crying.
          
          One of the crying men, shaking like a leaf, stands up, with
          terror in his eyes.

                    I've done many of those bad things.
                    Is there anything I can do to not
                    go to the bad place? Help me, I'm
                    so scared.

                    Well, you didn't know about these
                    bad things until I told you just
                    now so you're fine.

                    about people who do bad things

                    is fine.
          
          The crowd erupts in a massive cheer. People hug each other
          passionately, wiping tears from their eyes.

          thick Brooklyn accent.

          The whole crowd erupts in agreement. People stand up
          shouting, flicking off the sky.
          
                              MAN #5

          Mark looks worried. He didn't anticipate this. Suddenly a

          Mark looks out at the crowd, they're all exhausted, their
          minds completely blown. The Nurse who started this all steps
          forward.

          The doors open and they get inside. All three of them stare

          him in the hall.
          
          Mark, smiling proudly, stands behind the camera while Nathan
          Goldfrappe reads his script. In the background are Jennifer
          and Greg, hanging out on set. Jennifer can be seen chatting
          with Rob by craft services.
          
          Mark removes the "For Sale" sign from the front yard of a
          brand new, beautiful home. Jennifer and Greg congratulate
          Mark enthusiastically.
          
          Mark and Jennifer are walking down the street together when
          Mark stops to point out a new building with a sign that
          reads, "A Quiet Place To Think About the Man in the Sky". The
          building boasts a large stained glass window portraying Mark
          holding the two halves of the pizza box.
          
          Mark, Jennifer and Greg laugh it up in a stretch limousine as
          it pulls up to the movie premier of "The Black Plague".
          
          Mark, Jennifer and Greg walk the red carpet at the premier of
          "The Black Plague". Mark is the center of attention. Rob
          stops by on the red carpet to say hello to Jennifer and
          whisper something into her ear. Jennifer laughs.
          
                                                                    92.

          of sadness in Mark's eyes.

          A disheveled Mark, unshaven and sloppy looking, sits in a
          reclining chair, wearing boxers and a bathrobe, drinking a
          beer. Beer cans are littered everywhere.
          
          A young gay man in a suit stands before him with a pad and a

                    with a polar bear who could talk.
                    And the polar bear's name was
                    Martin. And the polar bear was
                    wearing a green cape. And Martin
                    and the flying duck both had race
                    cars with their names printed on
                    the side and...
          
          Jennifer enters the room, upset.
          
                               JENNIFER
                    I just saw three people climbing
                    the fence into your backyard. You
                    really need to think about getting
                    better security.
                         (noticing beer cans
                          EVERYWHERE)
                    Mark, how many of those have you
                    had?
          
          Jennifer grabs the beer out of Mark's hand.
          
                              MARK
                        (continuing; glaring at
                         JENNIFER)
                    But then the evil goblin witch came
                    in and stole the flying duck's race
                    car and made the flying duck very
                    angry.
                        (grabbing at his beer)
                              (MORE)
          
                                                          93.
          
                               MARK (cont'd)
                    Luckily the Polar Bear was there to
                    snatch the race car back...
                        (But he misses)
                    Unfortunately, the witch was a
                    smart witch and the polar bear was
                    powerless.
          
                              ASSISTANT
                    Is that the end?
          
                              MARK
                    Yeah.
          
                              ASSISTANT
                    That's a strange ending.
          
                              MARK
                    Hey, don't look at me: it's the Man
                    in the Sky's story.
          
                              ASSISTANT
                    You want me to take this over to
                    Lecture Films?
          
                               MARK
                    Yeah. Tell them to shoot that one
                    this week.
          
          The assistant walks away.
          
                              MARK
                        (YELLING)
                    Tell them it's for kids!
          
          Jennifer glares at Mark, disappointed.
          
                              MARK
                    What?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    You haven't left the house in
                    weeks. Every time I come by you're
                    just sitting here writing down
                    stories you get from the Man in the
                    Sky.
          
                              MARK
                    Hey, he's the boss.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Don't you think you should go
                    outside sometime? You know there's
                    about five thousand people on our
                    lawn waiting to ask you questions.
          
                                                                   94.
          
          
                              MARK
                    Yeah, yeah.
          
          Jennifer sits down next to him.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    What's with you? You seem sad.
          
          Mark shrugs.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I don't get it. You're a very
                    successful writer, you've won
                    countless awards and Oscars...
          
          Jennifer waves towards a shelf full of Oscars and various
          other awards.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    You've changed the way people see
                    the world, the way they see death
                    and life. You've made the entire
                    world happy.
          
                              MARK
                    Not the entire world.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I know. Not you. The one person who
                    should be happy, the person who has
                    everything...
          
                              MARK
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    Not everything.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    What else do you want?
          
          Mark sits up in his chair and looks right at Jennifer.
          
                              MARK
                    I'd trade it all in for you. All of
                    it.
          
          Jennifer sighs and sits down beside him.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Well, you've got me. As a friend.
          
                              MARK
                        (not sarcastic)
                    Yeah. That's important.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                   95.
          
                              MARK (cont'd)
                    But why can't we be together. Why
                    can't you be with me?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Because of the whole snub nosed
                    thing. With kids, your genetics.
                    You know, fat, short...
          
                              MARK
                        (stopping her)
                    Yeah. Okay. Yup.
                        (PAUSE)
                    It's almost a shame that being rich
                    and powerful and famous doesn't
                    change your genetics.
          
                                JENNIFER
                    What?
          
                              MARK
                    It would be great if it changed
                    your genetic material because I
                    really love you but I just don't...
          
          Suddenly Mark has an idea. He looks right at Jennifer.
          
                              MARK
                    It does change your genetics.
          
          Jennifer lights up.
          
                                JENNIFER
                    Does it?
          
          Mark stares at her for a short beat. He can't go through with
          it.
          
                              MARK
                    No. No, it doesn't. Our kids would
                    be short and fat with little snub
                    noses.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Right. Too bad.
                        (PAUSE)
                    Anyway, I've come to tell you I
                    can't go to the movies with you
                    tonight.
          
                                MARK
                    Why not?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I've got a date.
          
                                                          96.
          
          
                              MARK
                    What? With who?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Rob Marlowe.
          
          Mark stands up.
          
                              MARK
                    You've got to be fucking... Rob
                    Marlowe?!? He's a complete and
                    total asshole.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Not to me. He's very sweet and kind
                    to me.
          
                              MARK
                    Well of course he is, look at you.
                    I mean, for fuck's sake, a shark
                    would be nice to you...
          
                                JENNIFER
                    It would?
          
                              MARK
                    Well no, I mean...
                        (PAUSE)
                    Don't go out with him.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Why not? He's a great match for me.
          
                              MARK
                    What's he got that I don't?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    We talked about this. If you and I
                    got together it wouldn't be fair to
                    our kids. They have the right to be
                    attractive and have good genes.
                        (PAUSE)
                    If Rob and I get married You can
                    move into our mansion with us when
                    we all die.
          
                              MARK
                    I don't want to move into your
                    fucking mansion. And what are you
                    doing thinking about marriage with
                    him already? You haven't even gone
                    on one date.
          
          Mark sits down.
          
                                                                   97.
          
          
                              MARK
                    It's like nothing's changed.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    A lot of things have changed. I
                    wish you could be happy.
          
          There's a knock at the front door.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    That's him. Gotta go.
          
                              MARK
                    He's picking you up here?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    It was his idea.
          
          Mark stands up, in shock and follows Jennifer to the front
          door. She opens the door to find Rob looking handsome and
          arrogant.
          
                              ROB
                    What's up? Wow, I can't wait to
                    have sex with you.
          
          Rob notices Mark in his boxers and a bathrobe.
          
                              ROB
                    Oh hey there, Mark. You look like
                    trash.
                        (to Jennifer)
                    Come on Jennifer, let's go have
                    some fun. And then have some sex.
          
          Jennifer turns back to Mark, sad that he's upset.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'll call you tomorrow.
          
          The door closes and Mark is left standing there alone.
          
          Greg, dressed in a bathrobe and looking even more slovenly
          than Mark, waddles up behind him.
          
                              GREG
                    Who was that?
          
          
          EXT. MARK'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - NIGHT
          
          Mark and Greg are shit-faced, sitting around Mark's giant
          swimming pool.
          
                                                                  98.
          
          
                              MARK
                    Hey, watch this.
                        (yelling over the fence)
                    HEY PEOPLE!
          
          About forty voices shout back: "He's talking to us!" "Maybe
          he has more answers!" "Finally!"
          
                               MARK
                    The man in the sky just told me
                    something!
          
          Mark snickers to himself. Greg, drunk and stupid, can't help
          but snicker too.
          
                              MARK
                    You're all gay!
          
          Mark and Greg explode laughing. From the other side of the
          fence we can hear people mumbling shock. "I am gay." "I
          always knew it." "This is going to be awkward for my
          husband."
          
                              MARK
                    And adopted!
          
          Mark and Greg almost roll into the pool they're laughing so
          hard. The people on the other side of the fence aren't
          laughing: "Who's my real mother?", "This explains so much",
          "Dad, why didn't you tell me?"
          
                              GREG
                    I don't know why we're laughing.
                    It's really probably very sad for
                    those people.
          
                              MARK
                    I'm gettin' a beer.
          
          Mark hobbles up and walks into the house. Moments later he
          emerges with two cokes.
          
                              MARK
                    Out of beer. Just Coke.
          
          Mark tosses Greg a Coke and sits down on his chaise lounge,
          cracking open his Coke and taking a sip.
          
                              MARK
                    I want to do something big again.
                    Like telling the people what
                    happens when they die. That felt
                    good. I gotta do something big like
                    that again.
          
                                                                  99.
          
          
                              GREG
                    Maybe the Man in the Sky will tell
                    you something new.
          
                              MARK
                    Maybe.
          
          Mark looks down at his can of Coke.
          
          CLOSE ON COKE CAN: The warning label is extremely long and
          written in very small type. It starts with, "COKE IS VERY BAD
          FOR YOU. The following are diseases, physical ailments and
          general health issues that coke might cause:"
          
          The label then goes on to list dozens of ailments. Mark's
          eyes scan down to the very bottom of the label where it says
          simply, "If you still want to drink Coke, do so at your own
          risk."
          
          Mark looks over to find Greg staring at the depressing label
          as well.
          
                              GREG
                    Ugh, this shit is so bad for you. I
                    really shouldn't drink this.
          
          Mark stares at this label for a moment, thinking. With his
          hand he covers everything on the label except for "Please
          Enjoy Coke."
          
          He smiles widely.
          
                              MARK
                    Hey, Greg. What if I told you that
                    drinking Coke was good for you?
          
          Greg turns to him, his face full of hope.
          
                              MARK
                    And not just Coke. But all the
                    delicious foods you're not supposed
                    to eat. What if they were all of a
                    sudden really, really good for you?
          
                              GREG
                    It would be the happiest day of my
                    life.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
                                                                 100.
          
          
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          A dozen high powered executives from all over the globe sit
          around a massive board room table. The head seat at the table
          is unoccupied.
          
          They mumble back and forth to each other, unsure why they're
          there.
          
          Mark bursts into the room in a suit, looking very manicured.
          
                              MARK
                    Gentleman, thank you all for coming
                    here on such short notice. I have
                    some very big news for you all
                    today.
          
                              EXECUTIVE #1
                    Is it from the Man in the Sky?
          
                              MARK
                    Nope, this one I came up with all
                    on my own. And it's going to change
                    the way you all do business...
                    forever.
          
          Mark hits a button and a projection screen comes down on the
          far wall. Mark starts a slide show.
          
                              MARK
                    Up until now, all products sold
                    worldwide have warning labels
                    printed on them. Warnings like
                    these.
          
          SERIES OF SLIDES: We see the same warning we just saw on the
          Coke can, a commercial jet with "This Plane Might Crash --
          Four Of Our Other Ones Did" printed on its side, a car
          dashboard light reading "This Car will Ignite Upon Impact -
          Always", and a sticker on a grocery store package of ground
          meat that reads "Injected with hormones that make it taste
          better -- but will eventually give you cancer".
          
                              MARK
                    As you can see, a lot of these
                    products can be very depressing.
                    They remind people of all the
                    horrible things that can happen to
                    them in life. People hate thinking
                    about horrible things.
          
                              EXECUTIVE #2
                    Yeah, but they have to know those
                    things.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 101.
          
                              EXECUTIVE #2 (cont'd)
                    They have to be able to protect
                    themselves.
                    I don't want to hurt anyone.
                    Especially now that I know about
                    the "bad place".
          
          Everyone in the room shudders.
          
                               MARK
                    Hear me out, fellas. Allow me to
                    introduce you to the future of your
                    companies.
          
          Mark changes the slide to a can of coke that simple reads,
          "Coke -- Tastes Great! And It's Good For You!"
          
          Everyone in the room "ahhhs".
          
                              EXECUTIVE #3
                    Where can I get some of that
                    healthy coke?
          
                              MARK
                    It's the same Coke as before.
          
          The executives all squint their eyes.
          
                              EXECUTIVE #4
                    But this one is healthy! And it
                    tastes great!
          
                              EXECUTIVE #1
                    Do you have any samples?
          
                              MARK
                    Guys, it's the same Coke on the
                    inside. I've just changed the
                    outside.
          
                              EXECUTIVE #1
                        (REVELATION)
                    Somehow by changing the outside,
                    he's also changed the inside!
          
          Everyone "aaahs" in understanding. Mark sighs and changes the
          slide to that of a commercial airliner with the words
          "Completely Safe" writing on the outside.
          
                              EXECUTIVE #2
                    Oh, thank goodness. I've always
                    hated flying!
          
                              EXECUTIVE #3
                    Me too!
          
                                                                 102.
          
          
                              EXECUTIVE #4
                    What an invention! How did you do
                    it?
          
                              MARK
                    I didn't do anything, guys. I made
                    this on my computer last night. The
                    plane is exactly the same as it was
                    before.
          
          Nobody in the room gets it.
          
                              EXECUTIVE #1
                    That's the only plane I'll ever fly
                    on again!
          
                              MARK
                    That's the point here guys. With
                    these new advertising strategies,
                    people will buy your products with
                    abandon.
          
                              EXECUTIVE #2
                    But it will take years to replace
                    all of our stock with these new
                    improved products you've invented.
          
                               MARK
                    No. It won't. All you have to do is
                    print these words on the packaging.
                    That's it.
          
          Mark changes the slide again: The car dashboard light now
          reads, "This Car Prevents Crashes", and another slide that
          shows a package of meat with a sticker reading, "This Meat
          Actually Cures Cancer".
          
                               MARK
                    Even if you don't understand it,
                    just start shipping these products
                    out to people as you see them here
                    and you're all going to get very,
                    very rich.
          
                              EXECUTIVE #3
                    How did you do it?
          
                              MARK
                    Look, they're still the same
                    products you have on the shelves
                    right now. The only difference now
                    is that people won't get bummed out
                    or scared when they use them. Isn't
                    that a good thing?
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          The executives all nod their heads in agreement and rise to
          shake Mark's hand.
          
                              MARK
                    Gentleman, if you'll excuse me, I
                    have five thousand gay orphans on
                    my front lawn that are going
                    bananas.
          
          Mark exits.
          
                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. SUPER MARKET - DAY
          
          We follow a suburban housewife as she pushes her shopping
          cart through the aisles of a bright and shiny super market.
          
          She picks up a six pack of Coke and notices the label: "New
          Coke -- It Tastes Great! And it's Good For You!"
          
          The housewife smiles widely and enthusiastically tosses it in
          her cart.
          
          SERIES OF CUTS: The housewife grabbing different products,
          marveling at the new, improved features: "Cures Sadness!",
          "Tastes Better than Real Chicken!", "This Candy is All Your
          Body Needs To Survive!"
          
          With a full cart the housewife wheels it to the checkout
          counter to find swarms of people already there, all of their
          carts bursting to the brim with new, exciting products.
          
          Everyone looks excited and happy.
          
          
          INT. BAR - MORNING
          
          Back at his old stomping ground, Mark sits at the bar by
          himself drinking coffee and watching the TV.
          
          Greg sits next to him, with two boxes of cookies and a liter
          of coke in front of him.
          
          Different newspapers are spread out on the bar, all of them
          with similar headlines, "World Rocked By New Healthy
          Products", "People Everywhere Line up for Guilt-Free Treats",
          "YOU CAN EAT CAKE -- ALL THE TIME!".
          
          ANGLE ON TV: A FAT MAN is being interviewed in front of a
          super market, he holds a bag full of junk food in front of
          him.
          
                                                                 104.
          
          
                              FAT MAN
                    Thank the Man in the Sky for this.
                    I've never been happier in my life.
                    Now I can eat whatever I want,
                    whenever I want.
          
          The man takes a bite of a Twinkie and wavers a bit like he's
          going to pass out.
          
                              REPORTER
                    Are you all right, sir?
          
          The man steadies himself.
          
                              FAT MAN
                    Yeah. I must just be real happy. It
                    says on the wrapper that they help
                    boost your happiness.
          
          The man smiles, but he's obviously not feeling well.
          
          BACK ON MARK
          
          He's watching the TV with a bit of worry on his face. He
          turns to Greg who is eating a stack of cookies and washing it
          down by gulping from a liter of coke.
          
                              MARK
                    You should slow down there, Greg.
          
                              GREG
                    Why's that?
          
                              MARK
                    Just because the package says it's
                    not bad for you doesn't mean you
                    have to gorge yourself on it.
          
                              GREG
                    But it tastes so good.
          
          Greg shoves three more cookies into his mouth.
          
                              MARK
                    That's just stupid.
          
                              GREG
                    No it's not.
          
          Greg holds up the package of cookies and points to the
          disclaimer which reads, "These cookies make you smarter".
          
                              GREG
                    See?
          
                                                                   105.
          
          
          Mark sighs.
          
                              GREG
                    You look sad. Here, have a brownie.
                    They'll cheer you up.
          
          Greg hands Mark a brownie that, sure enough, says "They'll
          cheer you up!" right on the package.
          
                              MARK
                    I wish that worked for me, Greg.
          
                              GREG
                    What?
          
                              MARK
                    Nevermind. I'll see you around.
          
          Mark gets up and leaves.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S CAR -- DAY
          
          Mark drives while we take in a bit of his world, highlighting
          the various changes he's wrought.
          
          A homeless man stands on the street corner with a sign that
          now reads, "Screw it. I'll be in my mansion soon." He has a
          big smile on his face.
          
          The same business man pulls up beside Mark's car, this time
          eating a giant donut and talking loudly into his cell phone.
          
                              BUSINESS MAN
                    I'm not talking to anyone on my
                    cell phone. But from a distance I
                    look very important and busy.
          
          At a red light Mark eavesdrops on the same arguing couple.
          
                              GIRLFRIEND
                    No, I won't move into your mansion
                    with you when we die. You're really
                    smothering me.
          
                              BOYFRIEND
                    The more you push me away, the more
                    attracted I am to you.
          
          A bus passes in front of Mark's car. The ad now reads,
          "Pepsi. Just As Good as Coke."
          
          A car honks behind Mark. The man leans out of his car and
          yells at Mark.
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
                              HONKING MAN
                    Move it, fatty!
          
          As the man passes him, he looks at Mark and pulls up beside
          him.
          
                              HONKING MAN
                    Hey you're Mark Bellison!
          
                               MARK
                    Yeah. So are you going to
                    apologize?
          
                                HONKING MAN
                    For what?
          
          The honking man speeds away.
          
          
          INT. GRAVEYARD - AFTERNOON
          
          Mark sits in front of the gravesite of his grandmother.
          
          ANGLE ON: Her tombstone which reads, "Martha Bellison 1918-
          2007. Lived an average life for a woman in her time."
          
                              MARK
                    Nothing's really changed. I gave
                    people the Man in the Sky, made
                    myself rich and successful, told
                    the world they can eat whatever
                    they want and feel good about it.
                    Everyone's happy but me. Because
                    I'm the only one who knows it
                    all... isn't. I made it all up.
                        (PAUSE)
                    You're not up there living in a
                    mansion. You're right here. In the
                    ground. That's all. And I'm the
                    only one who knows that.
                        (PAUSE)
                    And the one thing I want I can't
                    have. Because the world is too
                    stupid to change. The world only
                    cares about what they can see, and
                    what they can know, and what
                    they're used to and what... makes
                    sense. No one listens to what they
                    really want. And that's why I'll
                    always just be a loser, grandma.
                    And that's why I'll always be
                    alone.
          
                                                           FADE TO:
          
                                                                  107.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          With a beer bottle in his hand Mark searches through his
          kitchen drawers for a bottle opener. He opens a drawer and
          something catches his eye.
          
          ANGLE ON: The envelope which reads, "MY INVENTION".
          
          Slowly Mark pulls it out of the drawer and stares at it.
          
          The sound of his front door opening startles him and Mark
          shoves the envelope into his back pocket.
          
                                 MARK
                       Who's there?
          
                                 JENNIFER (O.S.)
                       It's me. Can I come in?
          
                                 MARK
                       Sure.
          
          Jennifer enters the kitchen.
          
                                 MARK
                       Haven't seen you much lately.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                       I know. I've been busy with work
                       and things. And I'm getting
                       married. That's why I came over.
                       To tell you.
          
          Mark nods.
          
                                 MARK
                       Don't do it.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                       The wedding is tomorrow.
          
          Jennifer pulls out an invitation, Mark waves it away.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                       I hope you'll come.
          
          Mark shrugs and Jennifer puts the invitation back in her
          purse.
          
                                 MARK
                       No point really.
          
                                                                   108.
          
          
                              JENNIFER
                    It would make me happy. Being
                    around you makes me happy.
          
          Mark turns towards her.
          
                              MARK
                    So don't marry him.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I only have a few years to marry
                    someone with good genes and
                    financial stability so I can have
                    children and the family I've always
                    wanted. One day I'll be old and
                    wrinkly and ugly.
          
                               MARK
                    No you won't. Not to me you won't.
                    I love you. If you really love
                    someone it doesn't matter what they
                    look like.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    What do you mean?
          
                              MARK
                    Do me this favor. Just one favor.
                    Don't accept everything you see.
                    Don't just do something because
                    that's the way it's done.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    You're confusing me.
          
                              MARK
                    Think about what you want. Find out
                    what you really want. And if it's
                    not the same as what I want, well
                    then I'll know that and I'll never
                    darken your doorstep again.
                        (PAUSE)
                    I want you. What do you want?
          
          Jennifer and Mark stare at each other for a long beat.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'm going to go.
          
                              MARK
                    Please don't. Will you just stay a
                    little bit longer? I don't want to
                    be alone. Just sit with me.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          
          Jennifer nods. Mark leads her into the living room and they
          sit down far apart from each other on the couch. Mark turns
          the TV on and they both sit in silence.
          
          LATER.
          
          Mark has fallen asleep on the couch. Jennifer checks her
          watch and stands up. She takes out her wedding invitation and
          lays it on the coffee table by Mark.
          
          She unfolds a blanket and is about to place it on him when
          she notices an envelope sticking out of his back pocket. She
          pulls it out and looks at it.
          
                              JENNIFER
                        (READING)
                    My invention.
          
          She opens the letter and begins to read. Once finished, she
          folds up the letter and hurriedly leaves, scared and
          confused.
          
                                                          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Mark wakes up and sees Jennifer's wedding invitation on the
          coffee table. He sighs.
          
          
          INT. MARK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Mark stands before the mirror, dressed in a suit, putting on
          a tie.
          
          Greg pokes his head into the room, dressed in a suit as well.
          
                              GREG
                    We're gonna be late.
          
          
          EXT. "CHURCH" - DAY
          
          The sign outside reads, "A QUITE PLACE TO THINK ABOUT THE MAN
          IN THE SKY".
          
                              GREG
                    Makes sense people would start
                    getting married at these places. I
                    mean, who you marry decides who's
                    mansion you're going to live in one
                    day. It's a big decision.
          
                                                                    110.
          
          
                                MARK
                    Yeah.
          
          They enter the building.
          
          
          INT. "CHURCH" - DAY
          
          A small stage sits before a large stained glass window
          portraying Mark holding the two halves of the pizza box.
          
          Rob stands at the altar.
          
          Mark and Greg take their seats amidst a crowd of people
          sitting quietly in their chairs.
          
          
          INT. "CHURCH" - BRIDAL ROOM - DAY
          
          Jennifer sits in a small room in a beautiful white dress,
          looking as beautiful as any woman has ever looked. She stares
          absentmindedly out the window.
          
          There's a knock at the door. JENNIFER'S MOTHER pokes her head
          in.
          
                              JENNIFER'S MOTHER
                    It's time, dear.
          
          Jennifer doesn't answer. We PUSH IN on Jennifer to see she's
          clutching Mark's letter in her hand.
          
                                JENNIFER'S MOTHER
                    Jennifer?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I don't feel all right.
          
                               JENNIFER'S MOTHER
                    What's wrong? Do you have food
                    poisoning?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    No. I don't think there's a word
                    for what I have.
          
          
          INT. "CHURCH" - DAY
          
          "Here's comes the Bride" plays over an organ and Jennifer
          walks down the aisle towards a smiling Rob.
          
          Mark watches her in awe, stunned by her beauty. Rob notices
          Mark staring at Jennifer and mouths "loser" at him.
          
                                                                 111.
          
          
          Jennifer reaches the altar and stands across from Rob. The
          WEDDING OVERSEER, an elderly man in a suit, stands between
          them holding a few sheets of paper in his hand.
          
                              WEDDING OVERSEER
                    We are sitting here in this
                    building today to share in the
                    wedding of Rob and Jennifer. Two
                    young, attractive people who have
                    agreed that this union would be
                    mutually beneficial and that their
                    genetic match-up would most likely
                    produce favorable offspring and a
                    life of financial stability and
                    physical security.
          
          Both Rob and Jennifer nod at each other.
          
                              WEDDING OVERSEER
                    Rob, do you promise to stay with
                    Jennifer for as long as you want to
                    and to protect your offspring for
                    as long as you can?
          
                                ROB
                    I do.
          
                              WEDDING OVERSEER
                    Jennifer, do you promise to stay
                    with Rob for as long as you want to
                    and to protect your offspring for
                    as long as you can?
          
          Jennifer doesn't respond.
          
                                WEDDING OVERSEER
                    Jennifer?
          
                              JENNIFER
                        (to Overseer)
                    I'm sorry, hold on one second.
                        (to Rob)
                    Rob, can I ask you something?
          
          There's a slight hubbub in the room. Mark perks up.
          
                              ROB
                        (CONCERNED)
                    Sure. But what are you doing?
          
                              JENNIFER
                    What color are my eyes?
          
                                                                   112.
          
          
                               ROB
                    I dunno...
                        (LOOKING)
                    Oh, they're brown.
          
          CLOSE ON Jennifer's eyes. Indeed, they are brown.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    No Rob, they're blue.
          
          Rob looks again. Mark stirs in his seat, amazed by what he's
          hearing.
          
                              ROB
                    Oh, look at that. So they are.
                    You've got pretty blue eyes.
          
          PUSH IN on Jennifer. It works. Her mind is reeling.
          
                              ROB
                    Can we get on with this?
          
                              WEDDING OVERSEER
                    Jennifer, do you promise to stay
                    with Rob for as long as you want to
                    and to protect your offspring for
                    as long as you can?
          
          Jennifer is confused. Her mind is fighting it, but she
          doesn't know what exactly she's fighting. Finally...
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I do.
          
          There is a sigh of relief from the room. Mark shakes his head
          in sadness.
          
                              WEDDING OVERSEER
                    Before I pronounce these two man
                    and wife, is there anyone here who
                    thinks they'd offer either of these
                    people a better genetic match-up?
          
          Mark bolts up in his chair.
          
          
                              MARK
                    Me.
          
          The whole room gasps.
          
                               ROB
                    Oh come on. Look at you. You can't
                    be better.
          
                                                                  113.
          
          
                              MARK
                    Yes I can. You've got shmuck genes.
          
                              ROB
                    Schmuck genes? What's that?
          
                              MARK
                    And I love her.
                        (to Jennifer)
                    Jennifer, don't marry him. Is this
                    what you really want?
          
                               JENNIFER
                    I don't know.
                         (pause; unsure)
                    Yes?
          
          Mark thinks this over for a beat.
          
                              MARK
                    All right. I'm done. Goodbye.
          
          Awkwardly Mark makes his way to the aisle and leaves the
          room. The room is thick with tension.
          
                              ROB
                    Are we married yet? Because I've
                    got plans this afternoon.
          
          
          EXT. "CHURCH" - DAY
          
          Mark loosens his tie as he walks out of the building and
          towards the street.
          
          In the background we can see the "church" door open.
          
                              JENNIFER
                        (SHOUTING)
                    Hold on a minute!
          
          Mark turns, confused and tired.
          
          Jennifer runs to him. She stands before him, they both stare
          at each other.
          
                                MARK
                    What?
          
          Jennifer pulls out Mark's letter and shows it to him.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'm confused.
          
                                                                 114.
          
          
                               MARK
                    So am I.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Is any of it... the things you
                    said... are they... I can't think
                    of the word.
                        (PAUSE)
                    Is there a Man in the Sky?
          
                               MARK
                    No.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    Why'd you say there was?
          
                              MARK
                    Because I couldn't cope with the
                    look on my grandmother's face.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    But how could you say something
                    that... wasn't.
          
                              MARK
                    I'm not sure. I just did it.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    And what did you mean that I could
                    grow old and ugly and still be
                    beautiful to you?
          
                              MARK
                    I mean just that. You'll always be
                    beautiful to me.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    But what if my looks...
          
                              MARK
                    It doesn't matter.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I feel funny.
          
                              MARK
                    Me too.
                        (PAUSE)
                    Everything is so hard. Nothing is
                    easy anymore.
          
          There is a long moment of silence. Jennifer moves closer to
          Mark and looks directly into his eyes.
          
                                                                   115.
          
          
                                JENNIFER
                      I know what I want.
          
                                MARK
                      What?
          
                                JENNIFER
                      I want short, fat kids with little
                      snub noses.
          
          The biggest smile we've ever seen comes across Mark's face.
          
                                MARK
                          (JUBILANTLY)
                      Easy! That's an easy one.
          
          Just   like she did the night on her couch, Jennifer reaches
          over   and puts her hand on Mark's wrist. They both stare at
          each   other for a long beat, holding hands, love beaming from
          both   of them.
          
          The world is changing before their eyes.
          
                                 JENNIFER
                      Does anyone else know about your
                      invention?
          
                                MARK
                      No. But I'm sure it won't be long.
          
                                JENNIFER
                      Should we tell them right away?
          
                                MARK
                      I'm not sure. I don't think
                      everyone will understand.
          
          Greg sticks his head out of the church door.
          
                                GREG
                      What's going on out here?
                      Everyone's just sitting in there.
                      Are we gonna finish this wedding?
          
          Jennifer smiles at Mark.
          
                                JENNIFER
                      Yes.
          
          Mark smiles back.
          
                                MARK
                      Praise the Man in the Sky.
          
                                                                 116.
          
          
          WE RISE UP as Mark and Jennifer walk hand in hand towards the
          church -- and an unknowable future.
          
                               NARRATOR
                     The world's last moment of honesty.
                     A monumental occasion in the
                     history of mankind.
                         (PAUSE)
                     That lowly writer who stumbled upon
                     the ability to lie went on to
                     become one of the most important
                     men of his age, married to one of
                     the most beautiful women of his
                     time, and passed on the lying gene
                     to generations to come.
                         (PAUSE)
                     A world without honesty is a world
                     with dreams. A world with pretense.
                     A world with fiction. A world with
                     flattery. And most importantly, a
                     world with true love. Put simply, a
                     world very much like our own.
          
                                                      FADE TO BLACK.
          
          
          
                                  THE END
IT'S COMPLICATED

     FADE IN:


1   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MONTECITO, CALIFORNIA - DAY                1    
    A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara

2   CLOSE - ON A FOURSOME OF FRIENDS                              2
    The Couple who live in this house, SALLY AND TED, drink
    champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE AND        
    JAKE.

    JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50
    is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described
    by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this
    woman's appearance screams "solid."

    The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks,
    his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his
    glass of champagne.                                                
                         JAKE
               Happy happy happy...

                         JANE
                   (reminding him)
               -- Anniversary.

    Jake pauses, wryly turns to Jane, making her smile.

                         JAKE
               Some things never change.

                            SALLY
               Thank God.

                         JANE
               I thought maybe you were drifting.

                         TED
               He was pausing.

                         JAKE
               Exactly....
                   (sighs, raising his glass)
               Happy... Anniversary. You two have
               led an extraordinarily blessed
               life.

                    JAKE(cont'd)
          As long as I've known you both,
          you've always managed to somehow do
          everything entirely right.

                    JANE
          -- That's so true.

                    JAKE
          But, honestly, how can it be thirty
          years!?!   When did we do that trip
          to Spain?
              (looks to Jane)
          It was for both of our what..?

                    JANE
          -- Fifteenth anniversaries.

                    JAKE
          God, that was a great trip...

The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21    
YEAR OLD BOY joins the group, holding a bottle of beer. This
is OLIVER, Sally and Ted's son. All four light up as Oliver
puts his arm around his Mom.

                    JANE
          Ollie, how was graduation?

                    OLIVER
          It was fantastic. I can't believe
          I'm not in school anymore. When's
          Luke's graduation?

                       JAKE
          Next week.

                    JANE
              (correcting him)
          It's in three days!

                     JAKE
          Sorry!   I mean this week.

                    TED
          Are the girls going?

                    JANE
          They can't wait.                                      
Jane glances across the party and sees AGNESS, A FREE           
SPIRITED PRETTY WOMAN in her thirties, wearing a sarong over    
a bathing suit and walking directly toward them. She carries    
a slice of cake. Jane becomes instantly distracted and          
uncomfortable.
                                                      3.



                    OLIVER
          How long is Luke home before he has
          to go back for work?

                    JANE
          -- Only a week...                                
                    SALLY                                  
          Aw, that's it?                                   
                    JANE
          I know, I hate it. Well...
              (Agness joins the group,                     
               standing next to Jake)                      
          Congrats again...
              (puts down her champagne)
          Great party...

                    OLIVER
          You're leaving?

                    JANE
          Yeah, I have some
              (Agness hands Jake a piece
               of cake. Jane works hard
               at not appearing
               flustered)
          -- stuff I have to get done tonight
          for work...
              (to Jake & Agness)
          I'll see you two in New York.

                    AGNESS
          Absolutely. Lookin' forward to it.

                      JANE
          Good.    Well....

                    AGNESS
          -- Jane, what are you wearing to                 
          the graduation?

                    JANE
          Oh, a suit or dress, probably a
          suit.

                      AGNESS
          Fancy.    Okay.

Jane smiles tightly, raises her eyebrows to Sally.
                                                        4.



                    JAKE
          See you there, Janey.    Where are
          you staying again?

                    JANE
          We're at The Park Regent. You said                 
          you were at The Four Seasons,                      
          right?

                    JAKE
          I don't know.
              (to Agness)
          Where are we?

                    AGNESS
          We're at The Park Regent too.                      
                       JANE
              (hates    this)
          Oh. Good.     That'll be convenient,
          actually.     Okay, so, see you soon..             
              (waves    awkwardly)

                    SALLY
          -- I'll walk you out.

As they WALK AWAY, they HEAR:

                    AGNESS
          So, Ted, do you think you can help
          us get Pedro into El Montecito for
          kindergarten?

ANGLE - JANE AND SALLY - WALKING INTO HOUSE

                    SALLY
              (laughs)
          I thought it was sweet how well you
          and Jake were getting along. Felt
          like old times.

                    JANE
          Yeah, well, we know how to do this
          by now. It has been ten years.                     
                    SALLY
          That's crazy.

Jane hugs Sally good bye, her eyes landing on Agness         
affectionately rubbing Jake's back.                          
                                                              5.




    ANGLE - THE FRONT DOOR

    as it closes after Jane.


    ON JAKE - AS HE TURNS BACK

    and sees Jane is gone.

                                                      CUT TO:


3   TWENTY-THREE YEAR OLD GABBY                                   3    
    in jeans and a tank top CARRYING A CARTON OF BOOKS, A YOGA
    MAT AND A SMALL LAMP. Gabby is Jane and Jake's middle child.       
    But unlike most middle children, this one has never suffered
    from being ignored. Not a possibility with Jane as your
    mother. We are:


    EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

    The house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in
    the lush green hills of Santa Barbara. Neat rows of
    vegetables dot the landscape.

    Gabby arrives at her already packed Prius, where her OLDER         
    SISTER, LAUREN, 26, is trying to fit everything into the
    trunk. Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and        
    has an air of maturity about her.

                        LAUREN
              Gabby, stop...you're never going to                      
              fit all this in... you can come                          
              back for the rest tomorrow.

                        GABBY                                          
              I can't come back t---

    Gabby looks up to see HARLEY, LAUREN'S FIANCE, in a T-shirt        
    and over-the-knee gym shorts, lugging a huge suitcase down
    the front path, a duffel strapped across his chest.                
                        GABBY                                          
              Oh, God...that's all my clothes.

                        HARLEY
                  (sets the suitcase down as
                   he sees an SUV heading to
                   the house)
                        (MORE)
                                                           6.
                    HARLEY(cont'd)
          Okay, your Mom is home. She'll                        
          figure this out.

The SUV pulls to a stop, Jane gets out. Gabby starts pulling    
cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes.          
                    JANE
          Gabby, you're leaving now? I                          
          thought you were going in the
          morning?

                    GABBY                                       
          I know but my friends are all there
          and they wanted me to come tonight.

                    JANE
          But honey, it's gonna get dark
          soon. You can't see out the back
          window. It's Saturday night.
          People will be on the road
          drinking...

                    LAUREN
          Mom, she'll be there in a couple of
          hours, she'll be fine.

                    GABBY                                       
          Okay, I'm leaving this stuff here.
          I'll be back for it in a few days.

                    JANE
          Want me to drive it down in the
          morning?
              (Gabby's BLACKBERRY                               
               BUZZES, she laughs,                              
               thumbs flying)                                   
          I could be there by lunch. We could
          go to that big Bed, Bath, and
          Beyond, buy kitchen stuff... Gabby,                   
          can you look up from that thing??

                    GABBY                                       
              (looking up)
          I got it covered, Ma.
              (to Harley)
          Hey gangsta, help me carry these...

                    HARLEY
              (exhausted)
          Yep....

Gabby and Harley CARRY THE BOXES back into the house.   Jane    
seems worried as she watches them.                              
                                                             7.



                    LAUREN
          Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the                     
          house alone?

                    JANE
          What are you....? No!
              (Lauren looks doubtful)
          -- I'm not! One of you is always                        
          moving out...                                           
              (Gabby re-joins)                                    
          But I am wondering who I'm gonna
          watch The Hills with?


                    GABBY                                         
              (huge hug)
          Mamacita... I'm gonna miss you.

Jane hugs her back, but is aware of not hugging too hard.         
Harley joins the group.                                           
                    GABBY                                         
          Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing
          this.
              (walks to her car)
          Mom, you don't happen to know where
          Dad is, do you? I tried calling
          him to say goodbye...

                    JANE
          He was at Sally and Ted's.

                    HARLEY                                        
          He was? How was that? You and
          them at the same --                                     
              (Jane turns to him)                                 
          -- not that it's in any way, any of                     
          my... was just...                                       
                    JANE
          -- It was....                                           
              (notices both girls wait
               for her answer)
          -- whatever. It was fine.

                    GABBY                                         
          Was her lunatic child there?

                    JANE
              (laughs)
          Not this time. Gabby, call me when                      
          you get there. Do NOT forget.

                        JANE(cont'd)
                  (Gabby texts, deep in                                    
                   convo )
              Gabby!                                                       
                        GABBY                                              
              I will. I'll call you!                                       
                        LAUREN
              Knock `em dead, little one.

                        HARLEY
              And call us when you get there,
              too. And no texting and driving.

    Jane loves that Harley said that. Gabby gets in her car and            
    starts off.

                        HARLEY
                  (puts his arm around
                   Jane's shoulder)
              They grow up so friggin' fast. I
              hate it.                                                     
    Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight.                      
                        LAUREN
              Maybe you should get a dog.

                           JANE
              Oh my God.     Goodbye you two.   Love
              you.

                        HARLEY
                  (heading for their car and
                   getting into the
                   passenger seat)
              Love you boss!

    As Lauren and Harley drive off,    Jane turns and looks at her
    suddenly very empty nest.


4   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                    4
    A Woman's house. Books and art collected over years.
    Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture. Jane kicks off
    her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep breath!


5   INT. KITCHEN                                                      5
    Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen.      The Kids have left a       
    few glasses and plates on the island.
                                                              9.


    Jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she          
    suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone. She pauses,            
    allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of      
    it.                                                                


7   INT. THE BAKERY - MONTECITO - DAY                             7    
    This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling
    BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in
    Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au          
    chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get
    in.

    A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving
    between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and           
    friendly.

    Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside
    the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with
    powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass-
    through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.

                        JANE
              Reynaldo...
                  (nods to the muffins)

                        REYNALDO
              Too much sugar.

                        JANE
              Little bit.                                              
    Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray.                          
    Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter.
    Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of
    coffee with lids.

                        JANE
              Who wants coffee while they're
              waiting?

    Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee.

    JANE WALKS THE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

    refills a glass of water, checking on her customers.               
                        JANE
                  (quietly to a Young                                  
                   Employee)
              Check on table five, will you?                           
                                                             10.



    The Young Employee nods as Jane looks up and sees a MAN on         
    the other side of the counter. They exchange polite hellos         
    when Jane notices PETER, tan and confident, approaching her.       
                        JANE
                  (all smiles)                                         
              Peter!

    PETER joins ADAM, the man who stands across from Jane. Adam        
    is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. There's                
    something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor. He
    holds rolled blueprints.

                        PETER
              Jane, I can't remember, have you                         
              ever met Adam Schaeffer?                                 
                JANE                             ADAM
    No.                             Yes.


                        ADAM
              Well....                                                 
                  (shrugs awkwardly )                                  
                        PETER                                          
              Look what we've got.                                     
                        ADAM                                           
                  (raises the blueprints)
              Your plans.                                              
                        JANE
                  (to Peter)
              So excited!


8   INT. JANE'S SMALL OFFICE - UPSTAIRS AT THE BAKERY             8
    A farmhouse table almost fills the room. On the walls,
    posters for Jane's two cookbooks, framed food photos and a
    few reviews.

    Jane, Peter, and Adam sit around the table as Adam rolls out
    the blueprints in front of Jane.

                        JANE
                  (before she looks)
              I've been thinking about this
              addition for ten years.                                  

    Peter and Adam watch as Jane's eagle eye examines the plan.
                                                          11.



                    JANE
          Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, niiice....I
          like this wall of windows, Peter.

                    PETER
          That was Adam actually.

                      JANE
          Oh.
              (still perusing, then to
               Peter)
          Love where you put the stairs.
          That's so good!

                    PETER
          Adam's idea...

Did she hear that?

                    JANE
          Oh my God, the kitchen! Finally -                      
          I have a real kitchen with four                        
          walls... It's...oh, wow...you                          
          actually understood what I wanted!

Jane looks to Peter with enormous appreciation.   Peter looks    
to Adam.

                      PETER                                      
          All Adam.                                              
Jane turns to Adam.                                              
                    ADAM
          I'm happy you like it.

                    JANE
              (finally noticing him)                             
          Okay. Hi.                                              
              (shakes his hand)

                    ADAM
              (laughs)
          Hello.

                    JANE
          You read all my e-mails.

                    ADAM
          All 47 of them.                                        
                                                            12.



Jane smiles as her Office Manager sticks her head in the          
door.

                    OFFICE MANAGER
          Jane, it's 10:15.

                     JANE
          It is?
              (rises)
          Oh, sorry, I have a 10:30...
          dentist. Can you leave these and
          I'll make a few notes? Well,
          actually, I have one tiny note now.
              (to Adam, re: plan)
          In my bathroom...um...no his and
          her sinks.

                    ADAM
          Okay, sure. No his?

                       JANE
          Just hers.

                    ADAM
          And you don't think in the future
          you might want a his?

                    JANE
          Oh, God, we're talking code about
          my life, right?

                    ADAM
              (laughs)
          No, no, didn't mean to be.

                    JANE
          The truth is, in my current                             
          bathroom, I have two sinks and                          
          sometimes the other sink makes me
          feel bad.

                    ADAM
          One sink. Not a problem. Can we
          schedule a meeting for next week?
          Does Tuesday work for you?                              
                    JANE
          Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too                       
          early? At the house?

                    ADAM
          I'll be there.
                                                             13.




9   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING                              9
    Way too chic for a dentist's office. Jane sits nervously in
    a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room.
    The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR
    ENTERS.

                         JANE
              Hi.

                        DOCTOR
              Hi. I'm Dr. Moss.

                        JANE
                  (shaking his hand)
              Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted
              to start with... and please don't
              take this the wrong way but I'm the
              type of person who kind of makes
              fun of people who get plastic
              surgery.

                        DR. MOSS
              I understand.

                        JANE
              You do? Good, because, you know,
              some women can look a little fake                        
              and plasticky. And in my opinion --
              worse.

                         DR. MOSS
              I agree.

                        JANE
              Oh, that's good, so, well, as
              against the whole thing as I am, I
              do have a problem that's been
              bugging me. My left eyelid is
              really saggy. I find I'm sometimes
              holding it up when I'm watching TV
              or reading and I was wondering if
              that's something you could fix.

                        DR. MOSS
                  (looking at her closely)
              It's resting on your eye lashes.                         
                         JANE
              Is it?
                                                              14.



                         DR. MOSS
                   (measures her lids with a
                    very tiny ruler)
               Actually you have the same amount
               of excess skin on both sides.

                         JANE
               I do? Well, I'm only interested in
               fixing one eye.                                       
                         DR. MOSS
               Jane, what you need to fix this is
               a brow lift.

                         JANE
               A brow lift? Wh-what is that
               exactly?

                           DR. MOSS
               We surgically cut at your hair
               line. Incision goes right across                      
               here.                                                 
                   (demonstrates on himself
                     by indicating a line
                     drawn like a headband)
               Then we just lift the skin up a
               little tighter across the skull.
                   (Jane nods, already hating
                     this)
               We staple it back in place right
               above your ears. Recovery isn't
               all that bad but you could be
               fairly numb and you'll probably                       
               have a headache that lasts anywhere
               from say 3 to 6 months.


10   INT. ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING                               10
     Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little
     nauseous. She taps on the Lobby button.   The elevator moves
     down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty
     hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility
     Center. Helping Couples Become Parents.

     Jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps
     back toward the corner. A messy looking 5 YEAR OLD BOY          
     dashes in. Jane recognizes him. She looks up and Jake and
     his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black     
     dress (very Angelina Jolie) get on the elevator, obviously      
     mid-argument.
                                                         15.



Agness' mood seems very dark today. They instantly shut up
when they realize Jane is in the elevator.

                     AGNESS
          Jane!

                     JANE
          -- Hey..                                               
                     JAKE
          Hiii.

                     JANE
          Hello.

                    AGNESS
              (pushing the Lobby button,
               mumbles)
          -- Perfect.

                    PEDRO
          Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake.

                    JAKE
          Hold on Pedro, I'm talking to
          someone.

Pedro sits on the floor, crashing into the back wall of the
elevator.

                    AGNESS
          Pedro, up! Now!!                                       
              (she snaps)

Jane unconsciously holds up her left eyebrow.

                    JAKE
          What are you doing in this
          building?

                     JANE
          Dentist.

                    JAKE
          You don't go to Sharon anymore?

                    JANE
          Uh, no... changed.

Jane looks at the fertility literature in Jake's hand just as
Jake slips it behind his back. An awful two seconds of
silence, then Jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on Agness'
back. It creeps her out.
                                                              16.


     Jake catches Jane's reaction, then thank God the doors open.
     Jake leans down and picks up Pedro who instantly climbs up      
     his back.                                                       
                         JAKE
               Honey, don't do that..

11   As they all EXIT THE ELEVATOR, Pedro has now made his way up
                                                               11    
     to Jake's shoulders. Think chimpanzee. Agness' cell RINGS       
     and as she answers it --

                         JANE
               -- See you in the Big Apple.                          
     Pedro is now resting on Jake's head.                            
                         JAKE
                   (trying to be nonchalant                          
                    with a kid on his head,                          
                    smiles)                                          
               See you there.


12   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN/DINING AREA - THAT NIGHT              12
     Jane and THREE OF HER GIRLFRIENDS are mid-meal. The wine is
     flowing and the women are laughing. TRISHA has happily never
     been married. JOANNE is widowed and DIANE is divorced. They
     are all Jane's age and have been friends forever.

                         TRISHA
               That is beyond....

                         JANE
                   (laughing)
               -- When the three of them got in                      
               the elevator... between that and                      
               the staples and the headache for
               six months... it was the most                         
               insane hour of my life.

                         DIANE
               -- Jake has lost his mind.

                         JANE
               Oh, I don't know...

                         DIANE
               I know. First of all, he was a
               complete prick for cheating on you.

                         JANE
               Well, can't disagree with that.
                                       17.



          DIANE
And then he marries her... a known
lunatic.

          JANE
She has a big job.

          TRISHA
Why do you always say that?

          JANE
Because she does. She runs the
whole marketing department at KY,
whatever that station's called so
she's not that big of a lunatic.

          DIANE
Janey, come on, he cheats on you
with her, your 20 year marriage
ends then six months later she
leaves Jake for some random guy,
has a baby, leaves that guy,
marries Jake and she's not nuts?

          JANE
    (groans)
Jo, you're so lucky Jerry's dead.

          JOANNE
Oh, thanks.

          JANE
No, I mean, you never have to bump
into him.

          JOANNE
That's true.

          TRISHA
    (rises to get more wine)
Janey, you want to meet a guy I met
on Match.com that I didn't like?

          JANE
Gee, what a great offer.   I don't
think so.

          TRISHA
He wasn't that awful.

          JANE
Oooo. Sounding better every minute.
                                                         18.



Trisha stops at Jane's seat, refilling Jane's wine glass.

                    TRISHA
          You know it's not healthy not to
          have sex for...however long it's                     
          been...                                              
                    JANE
          Trust me... I'm not not doing it on
          purpose.

                    DIANE
          Okay. I don't know if this is true,                  
          but I read on line about this woman
          who hadn't done it in so long her
          vagina closed up.

                      JANE
          What!!!    Get out of here.

All the Women SCREAM.

                    DIANE
          I swear to God. It grew back
          together.

                    JOANNE
          Wait. Was it ever one piece?

                    DIANE
          All I know is, she had to have a
          vaginaplasty.

                      TRISHA                                   
          Ouch!!!!                                             
                    JANE
          Oh my Goddddddd.

 Jane flops over on the table, laughing, resting her head.     
                    JANE
              (lifts her head, then
               talks as if she's in the
               doctor's office)
          "Dr. Moss, Hi. I have a little
          situation that needs fixing...."

                    TRISHA
          Bubbee, you want to fix your
          situation? Just date someone.
          Seriously. Anyone.                                   
                                                                19.



      As Jane takes that in, we:                                          
                                                          CUT TO:         




16    EXT. THE PARK REGENT HOTEL - NYC - DAY                        16    
      CAMERA BOOMS DOWN ON Park Avenue to find Jane, the Girls and        
      Harley, just out of a Cab. The Bellman is taking their              
      luggage as the Girls spot their brother, LUKE, heading toward
      them.

      Lauren and Gabby run to Luke, hug him, commenting on his            
      hair, his shoes, his jeans, his tan. Jane lights up when she        
      sees her son, hugs him incredibly hard, kisses his cheek,           
      then another tight squeeze.

                           JANE
                Love when we're all in the same
                time zone.


A17   INT. THE PARK REGENT LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER                A17       
      They all cross THROUGH THE LOBBY toward the RECEPTION DESK.         
                          HARLEY
                So, what's up Luke?      Did you decide                   
                to have the party?

                            LUKE
                Oh, yeah.    Big time.                                    
                          JANE
                What party?

                          LUKE
                Are you guys gonna sleep over?

                          LAUREN
                If you give us your bed and change
                the sheets.

      They arrive at THE RECEPTION DESK.

                          JANE
                You're having a party? When?
                    (to Reception Clerk)
                Hi. Adler. Two rooms...hopefully
                next to each other.
                                                 20.



                    RECEPTION CLERK
          I have an Adler, J. in a Superior
          Suite, Park Avenue view. Oh, I'm             
          sorry, here it is. Adler J -- two
          Standard Doubles. Sorry about                
          that.

                     JANE
          Yeah, we're not the ones in the
          Superior Suite. Have the other               
          Adlers checked in yet? Just
          wondering.

                    RECEPTION CLERK
          No, they haven't, ma'am. Not yet.            
          Now I just need a credit card and            
          your signature.

As Jane takes out her credit card...

                    LUKE
          -- Mom, is it okay if the girls
          come with me now and help me set
          up?

                    HARLEY
          And by girls he means the three of
          us.

                    JANE
          Wait. Hold on. Set up what? I have
          reservations for all of us for
          dinner. That's not happening now?

                    LUKE
          I don't know. Me and my friends
          are having this huge thing at our
          apartment and the girls said they'd
          help us set up..
              (sees her disappointment)
          We're going to be together all day
          tomorrow.

                    GABBY                              
          -- Mom, it's his last night before
          graduation.

                     JANE
          Okay, okay.    Do you want me to
          help or...
                                                             21.



                         LUKE
                   (super sweetly)
               -- Love your credit card....


17   INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER                      17     
     Jane rides the elevator carrying both girls' jackets and
     carry ons as well as her own. Just as the doors are about to
     close, a Good Looking Couple in their early forties gets on.
     As they go up. The Guy has his hand around the woman's
     waist, his fingers fanning her butt. The Couple looks at
     each other, smiling privately. Jane looks away.


18   INT. JANE'S ROOM - 20 MINUTES LATER                      18     
     Two double beds. Jane lies on top of one of the beds, fully
     dressed, shoes off, eyes wide open.


20   INT. HOTEL BAR AND RESTAURANT - TOP FLOOR - NIGHT        20     
     Jane ENTERS the hotel's posh bar/restaurant.                    
                         JANE
                   (to Host)                                         
               Hi. Adler. One.

                         HOST
               Hi. Your table's almost ready Mrs.
               Adler. Would you like to wait at
               the bar?

                         JANE
                   (trying to read upside
                    down reservation list)
               Sure. You don't happen to have
               another Adler coming in, do you?
               Adler for two?

                         HOST                                        
                   (perusing)
               No... You're our only Adler this
               evening.

                         JANE
                   (relieved)
               Thanks.

     ANGLE - THE BAR                                                 
     Jane takes a seat next to Two Hot Younger Women.                
                                                         22.



                    JANE
              (to Bartender)
          Pinot Noir, please. No, you know                      
          what? I'll have a Tanqueray Martini                   
          very dry with a twist.                                
Jane strums the bar top, checks out the room. It's fun being    
in a big city. Her martini arrives, she takes a sip and         
HEARS something very familiar. Jake's laugh. She looks
across the bar and sees Jake talking to the bartender. He
seems to be alone. Jane waves. Jake notices her and smiles.

                    JANE
          Where's your....??

Jake picks up his drink and carries it to the bar stool next
to Jane.

                    JAKE
          Pedro got the stomach flu so I'm
          flying solo.

                    JANE
          Really? Didn't know you knew how
          to be by yourself.

                    JAKE
          Any chance you could just go easy
          on me? Just a one night free pass.
              (noticing her)
          You look good, Janey.

                       JANE
          Yeah....                                              
                    JAKE
          You do. You always do.   Your
          hair's shorter.                                       
                       JANE
          Longer.                                               
                       JAKE
          I like it.

The Host joins them.                                            
                    HOST
          Mrs. Adler, your table's ready.

                    JAKE
          Want some company, Mrs. Adler?
                                                             23.



     Jane gives Jake a doubtful look.

                         JAKE
               -- We both have to eat.
                   (sees Jane is hesitating)                          
               When's the last time we ate a meal
               together?

                         JANE
                   (thinks for a sec)                                 
               Just the two of us? Alone?      1999.                  
                         JAKE
               So, come on. Once every ten years.

21   A HALF HOUR LATER                                          21
     New drinks arrive for Jane and Jake. Physically, they're         
     sitting as close as they've been in a decade.                    
                         JANE
               So...how are things in the
               fertility world?

                         JAKE
                   (checks watch)
               I can't believe it took you this
               long to bring that up.

                         JANE
                   (trying not to laugh)
               Sperm issues?

                         JAKE
               Apparently. Yes.

                         JANE
               A baby?! Really Jake? So...the
               next time you go to a graduation,
               you'll be what? Fifty-eight plus...
                   (tries to do the math)

                         JAKE
               -- I think the number you're
               looking for is 79.

                            JANE
               Okay.     So. Seriously, how is that
               good?

                         JAKE
               Why are we talking about this? I
               thought we were going to have fun.
                                                                 24.



                          JANE
                Where'd you get that idea?

22    A BOTTLE OF WINE IS OPENED                                  22
      and poured. The bar has filled up and Jane and Jake are           
      sitting a little closer together.                                 
                          JAKE
                -- Just tell me, how long were you
                seeing him for?

                          JANE
                Oh, please, it was five years ago.

                          JAKE
                I know but I always wondered so...

                          JANE
                Little jealous?

                            JAKE
                Yes.

                          JANE
                The man's married now.

                          JAKE
                I don't care. How long?

                          JANE
                Eight months.

                          JAKE
                    (surprised)
                Long....

                            JANE
                Not long.

A23   LATER                                                      A23
      The bar is now crowded. Jane and Jake are finally eating but      
      still drinking. Jake is telling Jane a long story and she         
      can't stop laughing.                                              

23    OMIT                                                        23    


24    BRANDY TIME                                                 24
      A DJ spins for the after dinner crowd. Couples dance on the       
      dance floor. Jane and Jake both react to the song.                
                                                             25.



                         JAKE                                        
               This song reminds me of your                          
               birthday party... the one in our                      
               old house...                                          
                         JANE                                        
               -- Oh, yeah. That was such a fun                      
               night.                                                
                         JAKE                                        
               So fun. You wore that white halter                    
               dress....                                             
                         JANE                                        
                   (remembering)                                     
               Oh, yeahhhh....                                       
                   (remembering it all, looks                        
                    at Jake with a longing                           
                    for her own past...)                             
                         JAKE                                        
               Want to dance?                                        
                           JANE                                      
               -- No...!                                             




25   THE DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                          25
     Jake and Jane are dancing...it's familiar yet with the blush
     of the new. Something's going on here. Jake starts singing.
     Jane joins in. This is by far, the loosest we've seen her.
     Of course, it helps that she's drunk. They dance around one
     another without inhibition. A mating dance....

                         JANE
                   (astonished, laughing)
               You're married to someone else...!

                         JAKE
               Tell me about it!

     They both laugh then Jake pulls Jane close.                     
                         JANE
                   (sexy....)
               Hey.... I know you.
                                                                 26.



                         JAKE
                   (looking deeply into her)
               And I know you....

                                                       CUT TO:          


26   INT. JAKE'S SUITE - LATER                                    26
     They're in bed and they've done it. They're not even
     entirely undressed. They're spent, sweaty, breathing
     heavily. Jake cups his hand on Jane's vagina, gives it a
     solid pat and hold.

                         JAKE
               Home sweet home.

                         JANE
               Oh......God.........

     Jane covers her face.

                         JAKE
               That was one crazy ride...thought
               we were going to break the bed.

                         JANE
                   (not looking good)
               -- I'm having an out of body
               experience.

                         JAKE
               Totally. You're so great, Janey. I
               forgot how great. Holy shit.

                         JANE
               Please shut up.    I'm so dizzy.

                         JAKE
               And the pilates are payin' off by
               the way.

     Jane moans, OPENS THE NIGHT TABLE DRAWER, leans over and
     throws up into it.

                           JAKE
               Oh no!

     Jane woozily sits up on her side of the bed, her back to
     Jake. Jake looks over at her.                                      
                           JAKE
               You okay?
                                                                  27.



                         JANE
                   (starting to rise)                                    
               Look the other way.

                         JAKE
               Why?

                         JANE
               `Cause I have to get up.

                         JAKE
               Jane...I know what you...

                         JANE
               Look the other way Jake!!!

     As Jake turns away, Jane runs to the bathroom, carrying a
     pillow covering her bare ass. Jake hears her throw up again.
     He winces.


27   INT. BATHROOM                                                 27
     Jane sits on the floor, by the toilet, looking wiped out.
     Jake gingerly steps into the bathroom, hair a mess, wearing
     boxer shorts and his unbuttoned shirt.

                         JANE
                   (looking up at him)
               WHAT is wrong with us?

                         JAKE
               What do you mean? This was
               amazing. We just had a great time.

                         JANE
               A great time? This is the dumbest
               thing two people have ever done.                          
                   (giant moan.... )                                     
     Jake sits on the edge of the tub.    This is news to him.

                          JAKE
               Really? I don't know.... I haven't                        
               thought it out, but off the top of
               my head I'd say it was smokin' hot                        
               so something about it wasn't so
               dumb.
                   (she stares up at him,
                     sick as a dog)
               And, FYI, I like that you stopped
               getting bikini waxes. You've gone
               native. I was into it.
                                                              28.



     Horrified, Jane lets out a yelp on her way to throwing up
     again.


28   EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - NYU GRADUATION DAY             28
     The NYU Band plays Pomp and Circumstance as the Graduating
     Class of `09 ENTERS THE FIELD in caps and gowns. All the
     families in the bleachers are on their feet, applauding.

29   ANGLE - THE ADLERS                                           29
     Jane, in sunglasses, is sobbing, taking photos. Next to her
     are Gabby, Harley and Lauren, hooting, clapping and                
     screaming, "There he is!!!" And next in line is Jake manning
     the video camera, wiping away tears.

     ON THE FIELD, Luke spots his gang in the bleachers and gives
     a broad bow.

     The Adlers go crazy, especially Jane, who does a finger
     whistle. Jake looks over at Jane with puppy dog eyes. The
     girls notice, assuming their Dad is emotional over the
     ceremony. Jane feels Jake's glare but won't dare look over
     at him. Gabby nudges her Mom to look over at Dad. Jane             
     turns his way, sees that look in his eyes and starts to bawl.


30   INT. RESTAURANT - DAY - NYC                                  30
     The Family celebrates over lunch. Luke is telling a funny
     story about something that happened on stage at graduation.
     Jane is the only one not fully chiming in and laughing. She
     can't seem to move beyond what happened last night.

                         LAUREN
                   (sotto)
               You okay?

                          JANE
               Yeah.   Totally.

     UNDER THE TABLE

     Jake slips off his shoe and rubs his foot up Jane's leg and
     under her skirt.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Jane jumps, quickly turning it into a reaction to Luke's
     story. She gives Jake a private stare that says, "stop or
     I'll kill you."
                                                     29.



                    JAKE
          I would like to propose a toast to
          your Mother.

                    JANE
              (what???)
          To me?

                    JAKE
          I've done my part with you guys,
          but Jane... you -- very talented
          you...

                       GABBY                               
          Oh, God...

                    JAKE
          Gabby, I'm serious. Jane, you did                
          a magnificent job, as you always
          do...

The Kids look at one another...what's this about?

                    JAKE
          When I look at the three of you
          beautiful kids...all grown up, I
          think of all the work your mother
          did, much of it without my help...
              (starts to well up)

                    LUKE
          Dude...pull it together.

                    JAKE
          -- Janey, I take my hat off to you.

                    JANE
          Okay, Jake. Thank you.
          Out of nowhere, sudden
          appreciation. But thank you.
          Really.

                    JAKE
          Not totally out of nowhere,
          Jane...if you know what I mean.

                    JANE
              (quickly)
          Which I don't...but...

                    LAUREN
          What's he...?
                                                                30.



                         JANE
               -- Have no idea. Let's move on,                          
               shall we?                                                
     Jane holds up her droopy left eye.

                         GABBY                                          
               I'd like to say something too. For
               real. No offense to the lovely
               Agness or her charming offspring...
                   (the Kids stifle laughs)

                         JAKE
               -- Not nice.

     Harley stops laughing.

                         GABBY                                          
               I know. I'm sorry. But I just want
               to say I really loved today, just
               being with the original five...
                   (Luke nods in agreement)
               -- plus Harley, but he's like one
               of us. I don't think we've ever
               done this before... Had a meal
               together. And hung out like
               this...

                         LAUREN
               You mean other than the first 13
               years of your life.

                         LUKE
               I know what's she saying. It's been
               awesome....just for a whole day to
               be just... us.

     They all reflect on that one.


31   INT. THE PARK REGENT LOBBY - LATER                          31     
     The Adlers are at the Reception Desk. Jane and Jake are next
     to each other, signing their credit card receipts, the Kids
     chat behind them.

                         JAKE
                   (to Jane)
               Something feels right in the
               universe again, doesn't it?

     Jane looks at him but doesn't answer.    She turns to the Kids.
                                                         31.



                    JANE
          So who's coming home when?   No
          one's told me the details.

Jake's CELL RINGS. Jane half listens to his conversation.

                       JAKE
                 (into cell)
          Hey.
              (turns away)
          How's Pedro feeling?

Distracted, Jane focuses on Lauren.

                    LAUREN
              (responding to "Pedro")
          Okay, we're gonna help pack Luke
          up, the three of us leave day after
          tomorrow and Luke's home the end of
          the week.

                     JAKE
              (rejoins, finishing his
               call)
          -- I will. Call you when I land.                     
              (slips cell away, not
               missing a beat)
          Janey, what flight are you on?

                    JANE
          I'm on the uh, the four o'clock.                     
                    JAKE
          Ah, too bad. I'm on the five                         
          o'clock.

                    LUKE
          That's nuts, why don't you try to
          get on the same flight?

                    JAKE
          Yeah, I could try.

                    JANE
          It's been...great, but let's not
          ... push it.

                    LAUREN
          He was just trying to be nice.

                    JANE
          I know. Okay, I've got to hit the                    
          road, guys.

                         JANE(cont'd)
                   (kisses each kid as they
                    line up)
               Thanks for staying. So proud of
               you. Be good. Call me if you need
               me.                                                     
                   (she arrives at Jake,
                    pauses, speechless)

                         JAKE
                   (kisses her cheek)
               It was really fun.

                         JANE
                   (painfully)
               It was.

ADAM'S POV - JANE

jogging right past his car, listening to her iPod.

                    ADAM
          Jane!

She doesn't hear him. Adam backs up next to her. Jane slows
down. Adam lowers the passenger window. She looks in,
doesn't recognize him at first.

                    ADAM
          It's Adam...                                            
                    JANE
          It's 8:30 Tuesday morning!

                    ADAM
          Are we still okay?

                    JANE
          Yes! Totally forgot! I'm so
          sorry! Can you give me a lift back
          to the house?

                    ADAM
              (quickly cleaning up the
               front seat)
          Sure...come on in.

Jane GETS INTO THE CAR just in time to hear:

                    MALE NARRATOR (V.O.)
          -- But perhaps the most important
          lesson in going through your
          divorce is to learn to forgive.
          Forgiveness is the key to--

Adam hits the CD KNOB to turn the CD OFF, but instead he
accidentally FAST FORWARDS.

                    MALE NARRATOR (V.O.)
          In spite of your hurt feelings,
          prove to her that you can be a
          mature--

Adam HITS THE KNOB again and this time, turns it OFF, a bit
mortified.

                    JANE
          Just getting a divorce?
                                                               34.



                          ADAM
               Yeah.
                   (then)
               Two and a half years ago.

                          JANE
               Wooo.

                         ADAM
                   (embarrassed)
               It's been a process.

                         JANE
               Here's the good news. In two more
               years you'll actually begin to feel
               normal again.

                         ADAM
               In two more years I'll begin to
               feel normal? Why am I having
               trouble seeing that as good news?

                         JANE
               Maybe that was just my experience.

                         ADAM
               Oh God, I hope so.                                      


35   EXT. HOUSE - LATER                                         35
     Blue prints are spread on a garden table.   Adam is drawing as    
     Jane watches.                                                     
                         ADAM
               -- So if we move this wall back a                       
               bit, that can bring the arch                            
               forward, which is where you really                      
               want it, right?                                         
                         JANE
               Yes, I'd love that.

                         ADAM
                   (sketching)
               Thought so.

                         JANE
               I have an idea... what if we move                       
               my bedroom like six or eight feet                       
               so I can get more of the morning                        
               light?                                                  
                         (MORE)
                                                         35.
                    JANE(cont'd)
              (sees Adam hesitate)
          Not possible?

                    ADAM
          -- Yes, but you'll wake up in the                     
          morning, open your bedroom door and
          fall 12 feet into your kitchen.

                   JANE
          Ahhh! Forgot it was all open up
          there!

                    ADAM
          But I get where you're headed.                        
          Let me see what I can do... This                      
          property is so great... Have you                      
          lived here a long time?

                    JANE
          About ten years. I bought this                        
          place right after my divorce but                      
          it's taken me until now to be able                    
          to finally do this....                                
Jane and Adam are distracted when a Porsche noisily pulls up    
and Jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude.

                    JAKE
          Good morning!
              (to Jane)
          Am I interrupting...?

                    JANE
              (thrown that   he's here)
          Hi. No, well, we   were just about                    
          done. Adam, this   is my ex-husband,                  
          Jake. Jake, this   is Adam Schaeffer,                 
          my architect.

                    JAKE
          Hi.

                    ADAM
              (they shake hands)
          Good to meet you.

                    JAKE
              (re: plans)
          Can I take a look?   Do you mind?

Adam looks to Jane for approval but too late, Jake's already
looking.
                                                                 36.



                         JANE
               Everything's not 100% worked out
               yet...

                         JAKE
               Wow. You're finally getting the
               kitchen you always wanted...                             
                         JANE
               Yeah...

                         JAKE
               Huge bedroom.                                            
                         JANE
               It's not huge.                                           
                   (suddenly insecure)
               Why don't I show these to you when
               we get a little closer.

     Jane starts to roll up the blueprints, fumbles a little.
     Adam finishes for her. She thanks him with her eyes.

                         ADAM
               So, I think next we should stake
               out the addition... see how it all                       
               feels - size wise...                                     
                         JANE
               Sounds great.                                            
                         ADAM
               I'll e-mail you and we'll set it                         
               up. We did good work today. Jake,                        
               nice meeting you.

     Jake smiles and waves as Adam exits, walking to his car.           
                          JAKE
                   (turns to Jane)
               Got time for a cup of coffee?

     Adam can't help but sneak a look back at them.   Jane waves, a     
     bit embarrassed.


36   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                          36
     Jane moves nervously around the kitchen, opening the fridge,
     taking out juice...
                                                37.



                    JAKE                              
          Why haven't you returned any of my
          calls or e-mails?

                    JANE
          Jake, come on. This is just too
          weird. We have to just never do
          what we did - ever again. You're            
          an adulterer and I'm an awful
          person, basically. I haven't slept
          in days. What we did was just so
          wrong on so many levels.

                    JAKE
          And it was so right on a couple of
          levels too. Admit it.

                    JANE
              (finally settles)
          No! It wasn't! On no levels was
          it right!

                    JAKE
          You can't say we didn't enjoy each
          other's company. Sitting at the
          bar, dancing...after dancing...
              (she doesn't want to be
               reminded)
          Come on, you and I haven't had fun
          like that in a hundred years.               
                    JANE                              
          Yes! Because we're not supposed to
          have fun like that! We're
          divorced!   Are you like, what?
          Unhappy at home?   Does she not
          "understand" you? Did you just              
          want to know what it would be like
          with someone my age? What is this?

                    JAKE
          I'd be lying if I said I never
          think about you, Janey. I think
          about you. A lot. And no, it's not
          perfect at home. Obviously. Look
          at me. I've got three grown kids
          and I'm going to kindergarten
          interviews. I'm a walking cliche.

Jane shrugs.   She agrees.
                                       38.



           JAKE
And I can't, literally can't stop
thinking about what happened in New
York. Fate brought us together
once, maybe it happened again.
    (she pauses...)
And I know... you've moved on with           
your life, I get it, but you can't
deny something real and honest
happened that night. Can't we just
go with it, see where it takes us.
No one has to know.
    (Jane shudders)
You were so great. So loose and
sexy. How often do you get to be
like that?    You can run and open
restaurants and build your perfect
kitchen but what about having
someone to hold you in the middle
of the night...?

          JANE
Not high on my list these days.

          JAKE
But what if that someone is someone
who's known you since you're 23 and
loved you for most of your life.

          JANE
I forgot what a good lawyer you
are.

          JAKE
Give this a shot, Janey.... Life is          
short and it's tough. Don't
discount what we have with each
other.
    (he's getting to her)
You know what they say... people in
nursing homes who have plants live
longer than the people without
plants.

          JANE
Oh, so you're saying you think this          
is a healthy choice for me?

          JAKE
Honey, I know it is.
                                                                39.




37   EXT. JANE'S GARDEN - SPRINKLERS GOING OFF                   37
     And the plants get watered.


38   INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER                        38
     Jane and Jake have done it again. In broad daylight and
     sober. They catch their breath.

                         JANE
               Oh, God, it's official.    We're
               having an affair.

                         JAKE
               Why do you need to label                                
               everything?

                         JANE
               Because that's what this is.

                         JAKE
               Yes, in its crassest form, maybe,
               if we were two other people.

                         JANE
               Just because we were married for 19
               years does not not make this an
               affair.

                         JAKE
               Okay, but since we were together
               for so long, it's not really that
               wrong.

                         JANE
               Really? You want to run that logic
               by your wife?

     Jane fans herself.


                         JANE
               Do me a favor, you're on my side.
               Can we switch? I feel disoriented.

                         JAKE
               Since when is this your side?

                         JANE
               Since ten years ago.   Please...                        
                                                              40.



They switch sides. In the middle of this maneuver Jake lands
on top of Jane. He pauses.

                    JAKE
          Could I interest you in a little...

                    JANE
          No!                                                       
They flop onto the opposite sides of the bed.    Jane fans
herself. So hot.                                                    
                    JAKE
              (turns to her)
          Why do you think the sex is so much
          sexier this time?

                    JANE
          I don't know.

Jane pulls the sheet up.   They look at one another. He gets        
her to smile.                                                       
                    JANE
          I've gotta get to work.

                    JAKE
          Me too. Okay...
              (moans as he sits up, then                            
               rises)

Jake starts to get dressed. Jane watches him from bed,
checking out his stomach. He notices.

                    JAKE
              (indicating his belly)
          See what happens when you're not
          looking out for me.
              (pats it)
          She lets me eat everything.. pasta,
          cream cheese...

                    JANE
          Can you hand me my robe?

Jake reaches for Jane's robe, hands it to her.   She indicates
Jake should turn around.

                    JAKE
          Why do I have to..?
                                                 41.



                    JANE
          -- Because the last time you saw me
          standing up naked I was in my
          forties.
              (Jake can't believe this)
          Things look different lying down.
          Just...

Jake rolls his eyes, turning away from her.

                    JAKE
          You've gotten a little nuts.

                    JANE
              (slipping into her robe)
          Jake, I think it would be really
          good for us to not talk for a few
          days. Okay?                                  
                    JAKE
              (turning back to her)
          You know what I think -- just for
          the record? I think we're doing
          something kinda brilliant. All the
          things that tore us apart aren't
          issues anymore. I'd say our
          problems actually went away.

                    JANE                               
          What..?                                      
                    JAKE                               
          Didn't you always say you felt you
          weren't being heard? Wasn't that
          our big issue -- both of us always
          feeling rejected and unappreciated.
          Look at us now. You're so much
          more together, you're not exhausted
          all the time, you're not catering
          every weekend and busy all day with
          the kids and I'm calmer, less
          obsessed about work. I'm a partner.
          I'm there. We grew into the people           
          we wanted each other to be! And I            
          don't know... I appreciate things
          about you I couldn't even see
          before.

                    JANE
              (not wanting to get into
               it)
          Really?
                    (MORE)
                                                             42.
                         JANE(cont'd)
               Well, you know, I'm not as good as
               you at remembering all the details
               of our...

                         JAKE
                   (getting dressed)
               -- Do you remember never having
               time for sex? Now look at us.
               We've already done it two times
               this week and it's only Tuesday. I
               swear to God, if half the couples
               who got divorced, could get back
               together 10 years later, their
               problems would be solved. I think
               we're on to something.

                         JANE
               Not sure I agree and...also, we're
               not back together.                                    
                         JAKE
               And I know other divorced people
               think about this...they wonder -
               what if....
                   (fixes his tie)
               I think this is very French of us.

                         JANE
               How is this French of us?

                         JAKE
               I have a young wife but I'm having
               sex with my old wife. Not old, you
               know. Ex!
                   (Jane nods....)
               I didn't mean old...

39   Jane tosses Jake his jacket. They EXIT the BEDROOM and head
                                                               39    
     toward THE FRONT DOOR.

                          JAKE
               You're doing that thing where you
               act like you're not listening...
               but think about what I'm saying,
               okay?
                   (then)
               Do you have any of your homemade
               granola here? I haven't had it in
               so long.

                         JANE
               You miss it?
                                                             43.



                          JAKE
               So much.

                         JANE
               We sell it for $6.50 a bag at the
               store.

                         JAKE
               Yeah, why give it away when you
               can...
                   (Jane OPENS the front door
                    and moves him outside)
               Kiss good bye?

     Jane kisses him on the cheek.

                         JAKE
               She wants to be courted!
                   (as he heads for his car)
               I can do that!
                   (turns back)                                      
               And honey, thanks for the....
                   (indicates sex with his
                    fingers)
               -- Coffee....

     Jane can't close the door fast enough.


40   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                40
     Jane carries three beautiful homemade pies, arriving in THE     
     LIVING ROOM where her Friends are gathered. Platters of food
     and open bottles of wine are on the coffee table.

                         TRISHA
               Oh my God, now what?   Three pies?!                   
               This is a feast!

                         JANE
               I don't know what's going on, I
               have so much energy lately which I
               think is probably a result of...
               all the sex I'm having.
                   (the Ladies LAUGH)
               Yeah. I'm actually not kidding.
               I'm having an affair.
                   (They stare at her)
               With a married man.
                                                 44.



                    DIANE
          What? When did this happen?
          Where'd you meet him?

                    JANE
          Well, it... started in New York.

                    DIANE
          In New York??? Last week?

                    JANE
          Yeah, we did it once there and once
          here. Maybe more than once there,
          I was drunk so...

                    TRISHA
          You had drunken sex with a married
          man in New York when you went for
          Luke's graduation?

                    JANE
              (laughs, embarrassed)
          Turns out I'm a bit of a slut.
              (re: pies)
          Apple, Blueberry or Plum?                    
                    DIANE
          Wait, wait, wait. Hold on....                
          You're not saying!!!!

                    JOANNE
              (clueless)
          -- What?

                    TRISHA
              (catching on)
          No! You're not!

                    JANE
          Oh, God, but I am. I'm having an
          affair with Agness Adler's husband.

The Women all SCREAM as Jane fans herself.

                    TRISHA
          That. Is. Genius!

                    JOANNE
          But also sort of wrong.

                    JANE
          I know.
                                       45.



          DIANE
Oh, please. Not that wrong.

          JANE
I know! I'm so happy to be able to
tell someone. This is the most out           
of control thing I've ever done.             
Literally. You know me.

          DIANE
Yes we do. You don't do anything
wrong, or bad. Ever. So you're               
allowed this one. I'm sorry ... I
kinda love it.

          JOANNE
He was yours first.

         JANE
True. Not that I want him back by
the way.

           TRISHA
Of course not. You can do better
than Jake.

          JANE
    (a little insulted)
Thanks.

          TRISHA
I mean you've outgrown him. You've
blossomed, you feng shuied your
whole life... Just please, don't
let him talk you into saving him.

           JANE
I won't...
    (wonders what that means)

          DIANE
There is something kinda perfect
about this. You don't have to cook
for him or clean up after him or
actually even sleep with him....

          JANE
Yeah, I have an Ex with benefits...          
                                                              46.



                         JANE (CONT'D)                                
               But, girls, what about the fact
               that I'm now the other woman? I'm
               the one we hate.

                         TRISHA
               Oh, forget that.    Agness is still                    
               the one we hate.    Even in this
               scenario.

                         DIANE
               Yeah, karma is the ultimate bitch
               on this one.


41   INT. BAKERY KITCHEN - DAY                                 41
     Jane walks through the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper.
     Her shirt is a little more fitted. Her make up, a little
     prettier. She crosses to the head Baker who's just taking a
     tray of cookies out of the oven.                                 
                         JANE
               Reynaldo, I'm changing the
               breakfast menu, want to give it a
               little more life...
                   (shows it to him, he seems                         
                    distracted)                                       
               What do you think?

                          REYNALDO
                   (distracted)                                       
               -- What'd you do? Something to
               your hair?

                         JANE
               I don't think so.

                         REYNALDO
               Something about you looks
               different. Little more "caliente."                     
                           JANE
               Caliente?

     Another Chef in the kitchen nods in agreement.

                         REYNALDO
               You see it Eddie?

                         EDDIE
               Whatever it is, it's workin'.
                                                                47.



     He winks at Jane as he stirs cookie batter.    Jane blushes as
     her cell phone rings.

                         JANE
               Hello.
                   (listens)
               No! I didn't do this again!


42   EXT. JANE'S OPEN FIELD   - LATE DAY                         42
     CAMERA MOVES IN on Adam, waiting by a ladder in the middle of
     the field. Jane's addition is staked out with orange tape.        
     REVERSE - ON JANE

     Rushing toward Adam.

                         JANE
               Adam, I'm so sorry.   My mind is
               just... Forgive me.

                         ADAM
               If I were your shrink I'd say maybe
               you don't really want to build this
               house.

                         JANE
               That's completely not true.   I'm
               really sorry.

                    addition)                                          
               Oh! I like it already!                                  
                         ADAM
               Yeah, it's feeling really good. So,                     
               this becomes your office. We come                       
               down your new hallway, the windows                      
               are all along here...                                   
                         JANE
               Great. Love it.                                         
                         ADAM
               And from here to there...wait, let                      
               me get the door for you...                              
                   (opens a piece of tape)                             
               Your kitchen.                                           
                   (they ENTER)                                        
               We're in the eating area. How's                         
               the size?
                   (pretends to sit)
               We're at either end of the table.
                                                              48.



                         JANE
                   (laughs at Adam)                                    
               Feels perfect.

                         ADAM
               I thought so too.                                       
                         JANE
                   (taking it all in)                                  
               This is heaven!                                         
                         ADAM
               It's gonna be cool.    Want to go                       
               upstairs?                                               


43   JANE AND ADAM ATOP SIDE BY SIDE LADDERS                     43
                         ADAM
               So if you were lying in bed, this
               would be your view.

     Jane breaks into a smile.


     THEIR POV - IN THE DISTANCE -- THE OCEAN

     Over this tranquil view -- A CELL RINGS. Jane takes her
     phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling. She pauses,
     then pushes "IGNORE" and then promptly loses her balance.
     Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her.

                           ADAM
               You okay?

                         JANE
                   (grabs her heart)
               Yeah.

     WATER RUNNING OUT OF A FAUCET


44   INT. BATHROOM - JAKE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                    44
     Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the
     sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting
     away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and
     then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs
     and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when
     he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness
     calling his name in anger. He leaps.
                                                         49.



                      JAKE
          Coming!

Jake quietly UNLOCKS THE BATHROOM DOOR and EXITS to find his
path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at
him.

                    PEDRO
          What were you doing in there?

                    JAKE
          Going to the bathroom.

                    PEDRO
          The toilet didn't flush.

                    JAKE
          Yes it did.

                    PEDRO
          Why were you in the shower with
          your clothes on?

                    JAKE
              (making sure Agness
               doesn't hear)
          What are you talking about?

                    PEDRO
          I heard the shower door close.

                    JAKE
          What do you have, x-ray ears?

Agness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking
through. She holds a broom.

                    AGNESS
          What's up Pedro?

                    PEDRO
          Jake took a shower with his clothes
          on.

                      JAKE
          Pedro!    Darling...                                   
                    AGNESS
          What's he talking about?

                    JAKE
          I don't speak Pedro.   That's your
          department.
                                                              50.



                          AGNESS
                   (to Pedro)
               Don't go in the kitchen, P, I broke
               something.
                   (to Jake, annoyed)
               Yo. Can you help?

     Agness EXITS back to the kitchen as Pedro stares at Jake.

45   TWO GORGEOUS CROQUE-MONSIEURS - COMING OUT OF AN OVEN       45
     These open-faced fancy French Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are
     carried to Jane's counter. We're:


     INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING                               
     Jane very professionally places the Croque-Monsieurs onto two
     waiting plates, adds some salad on the side. Adam stands
     nearby with a glass of wine, jacket off.                          
                         ADAM
               That looks amazing.

                         JANE
               It's called a croque-monsieur. It's
               one of the first things I learned
               to make when I lived in Paris
               because the ingredients are really
               really cheap.

                         ADAM
               When did you live in Paris?

                         JANE
               In my early twenties. I went there
               to take a six day pastry class and
               ended up staying a year working as
               an apprentice in a bakery.                              
     Jane places the plates AT THE ISLAND as she and Adam SIT SIDE
     BY SIDE. Jane raises her wine glass.                              
                          JANE
               Thank you for taking my 47 e-mails                      
               and turning them into something so                      
               beautiful.                                              
                                                              51.



                         ADAM
               You are rapidly becoming one of the                   
               most appreciative clients I've ever                   
               had...                                                
                         JANE
               Well, I'm not all that used to                        
               being able to count on anyone...                      
                         ADAM
                   (surprised by that)
               Really?                                               


46   JAKE DRIVING - SAME TIME                                  46
     He squints, looking ahead, SEES:

     JANE'S HOUSE - ALL LIT UP

     And Adam's car parked out front. Jake turns OFF HIS
     HEADLIGHTS, slowly pulling around to the side of the house.


47   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                       47
                         JANE
               I know it's none of my business
               but... I'm trying to figure out why
               someone like you is divorced.

                         ADAM
               And what'd you come up with?

                         JANE
               Something in the you're too nice
               department..?

                         ADAM
               Yes, that and my wife fell in love
               with my best friend. Ex-best                          
               friend.                                               
                         JANE
               Oh, no!

                         ADAM
               We were all on a biking trip, he                      
               and his wife, me and my
               wife...through Tuscany and on the
               last day of the trip they announced
               they were in love.
                                                              52.



                         JANE
               That's awful.

                          ADAM
               Yeah.   Not a great plane ride home.

                         JANE
               I can imagine, sitting there for
               eleven hours with your wife who you
               know is -- oh, that's rough.

                         ADAM
               Actually they went on to Venice and
               I flew back with Carol, his wife.
               You can't imagine what it's like to                     
               sit next to someone who's been                          
               crying for ten straight hours.                          
                         JANE
               I don't blame her.

                         ADAM
               I was talking about me. Anyway,
               they're married now and it's
               pretty much an ongoing awful thing.
               But, you and your ex... When I saw
               him stop by for a cup of coffee the
               other morning, I thought -- Wow!                        
               That's the way it's supposed to be.                     
               You two seem to have it all figured
               out.

                         JANE
               We're not as figured out as you'd
               think.


48   EXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME                                      48
     Jake, in work-out clothes, sprints across the front lawn,         
     careful not to be seen.                                           

49   BACK TO SCENE                                               49
     Jane clears their dishes.

                         JANE
                   (laughs)
               You know I hope you don't feel I've
               been interrogating you, but...
                         (MORE)
                                                             53.
                    JANE(cont'd)
          I know what it's like to have your
          ex remarried and to not have so
          much going on in that department.
          I mean, do you date ever or...                           
                    ADAM
          Uh, constantly actually.

                    JANE
          Constantly?

                    ADAM
          Everyone I know or have ever known
          has fixed me up. And then,
          sometimes I just meet women, I
          don't know how that happens, but...

                    JANE
          -- But no girlfriend?

                     ADAM
          Not yet.

Jane stands ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND and hands Adam
another croque-monsieur. She stays on her side, like a
waitress at a counter. She refills his water glass.

                    JANE
          Just like to date...

                    ADAM
          Actually, I find it really
          stressful. You know, the last time
          I was in the dating world was 1978.                      
          It's a little more complicated
          these days. I can't tell you how                         
          nice it is to have a conversation                        
          with a woman and have the pressure
          off. Not to mention, a home cooked
          meal that no one else I know could
          possibly cook.

Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that.   She
smiles, wiping the counter.

                    ADAM
          That was a compliment. So you                            
          don't have a guy in your life at
          the moment?

                    JANE
          No....
              (starts to say something.)
          No.
                                                                54.



                          ADAM
               No?




     EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                                       
     Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window.        
     He PEEKS in the window, balancing himself precariously on a         
     stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane telling Adam a story and        
     both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further to try to           
     hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet,        
     he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME.                    


51   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - A BIT LATER                               51
     Jane walks Adam to the door.    He holds rolled blueprints.

                         ADAM
               This was so nice and relaxing and
               the lavender ice cream was actually
               the best dessert of any sort I've
               ever had... like, in my life.

                         JANE
               Aw, thank you. I always make ice
               cream when I can't sleep, so I'm
               glad someone was here to eat it.

                         ADAM
                   (pauses...)                                           
               Great getting to know you a little.

                          JANE
                   (nods)
               It was really fun.

     Adam waves, Jane waves. Definitely a little sweet/awkward.          
     Jane closes her door, starts turning out lights, heading for
     the kitchen, when there's a QUICK KNOCK on the FRONT DOOR.

                          JANE
               Woops!   Coming!

     Jane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find:

     JAKE

     leaning in the door frame.
                                                 55.



                    JAKE
          O.M.G. I thought he'd never leave.
              (entering)
          Hello Jane, you look very beautiful
          tonight.

He takes her in his arms.

                   JAKE
          Mmmmm. Love when you smell like
          butter.

                    JANE
              (easing away)
          What are you doing here?

                    JAKE
          Missed you.

                    JANE
          It's nine o'clock. Where does your
          wife think you are?

                    JAKE
          At yoga.   Shall we do some
          downward facing dog?

                    JANE
          Not tonight big guy.

They CROSS INTO THE KITCHEN. CAMERA TRACKS.

                    JAKE
          Is it really necessary for you to
          always say no before you say yes? I
          won't think less of you, you know.

                    JANE
          Really, Jake, I'm a little tired, I
          was just gonna take a bath.

                    JAKE
          Good. So, we'll just hang out.
              (now IN THE KITCHEN, he
               SEES the dinner dishes on
               the counter)
          Ooooo, is that Croque-Monsieur?
          Who's plate is this? Yours or his?

                    JANE
          Mine.
                                                              56.



                         JAKE
                   (eats her leftovers,
                    savors the taste)
               Oh my God, just as I remember it.

                         JANE
               Don't you ever eat at your house?

                         JAKE
               Pedro dictates all meals and he has
               a very limited palate.
                   (sees melted ice cream)
               What kind of ice cream is that?

                         JANE
               Lavender Honey.

                         JAKE
                   (immediately)                                      
               Not sleeping?

                         JANE
               Not at all. You?

                         JAKE
               Never slept better. And my                             
               digestion is finally back on track.
               You've turned my world right side
               up, Jane. You know what this
               means, don't you?

                            JANE
               No...

                         JAKE
               That I've never really known how to
               live without you.


52   INT. JANE'S BATHROOM                                      52
     Jane takes a bubble bath. Jake lies on the floor, leaning
     against the tub, his back to her, eating a bowl of ice cream.

                         JAKE
               Maybe we should be growing old
               together.

                         JANE
               Hate to tell you, big guy, but we
               already grew old apart.
                                                 57.



                    JAKE
          What's with the `big guy'? Is that
          because you think I'm fat or is it
          a term of endearment?                        
                    JANE
          I have no idea why I keep saying
          that. I'm sorry. I'll stop.

                     JAKE
          Thank you.
              (then)
          I love how quiet it is in your
          house. I have no quiet in my life.
          Ever.

                    JANE
          Yeah, well, you live with a five             
          year old.

                    JAKE
          Yes...and don't forget Pedro.

Jane splashes him.

                    JANE
          So what does that mean exactly...?           
          What's going on over there at your
          place?

                    JAKE
          My marriage is... not turning out
          as I hoped. That's obvious....
          Agness started out really looking
          up to me... We never used to fight
          but now... with the kid....lately
          we're all about where he's gonna go
          to school and now she says we need           
          a bigger house, more help. I was
          thinking of cutting back at work...          
          now that's never gonna happen. And           
          she wants another baby before Pedro
          gets too old which I get but since
          we're always fighting... oh, God,
          listen to me.

                    JANE
          Isn't a baby part of the deal when
          you marry a woman that age?
                                                          58.



                     JAKE
          Is it? I guess so. She's got me
          booked at the fertility center
          every other day and she's so amped
          up on hormone injections I may need
          to find an exorcist if she doesn't
          calm down.                                            
               (Jane laughs)
          I wish it was funny.
               (finishes his ice cream)
          Incredible ice cream. I'm turning
          around...
               (as he turns, Jane shrinks
                in the tub)
          Remember when we used to smoke pot
          and eat your ice cream in the hot
          tub?

                    JANE
          The "hot tub"... That feels like a
          billion years ago.

                    JAKE
          How long has it been since you...                     
              (indicates smoking a                              
               joint)                                           
                     JANE
          Me?   Since before Lauren was born.

                    JAKE
          27 years?!!

                      JANE
          At least.

Jake slips a joint out of his shirt pocket, twirls it.          
                    JANE
          Are you kidding me? Put that away!                    
          It's been too long...

                      JAKE
          Exactly.

                    JANE                                        
          I'm not going to....                                  
                    JAKE                                        
          Okay, why don't I leave this with                     
          you... (It's kind of amazing.)                        
          Maybe you'll take a few hits...
                    (MORE)
                                                                59.
                            JAKE(cont'd)
                  get your sea legs, then we'll smoke
                  the rest of it together.

                              JANE
                  Maybe....

     Jake places the joint in a drawer.

                            JAKE
                  So that nerdy architect likes
                  you...you know that, right?

                            JANE
                  He's not nerdy and he definitely
                  doesn't. We're working together.

                            JAKE
                  I was watching when you bent down
                  to open the oven, his eyes were
                  glued to your ass.

                            JANE
                      (changing the subject)                           
                  Hey, will you do me a favor?


53   INT. FOYER                                                  53
     Jake is on a small ladder, changing a light bulb in the
     chandelier. Jane, in a robe, stands beneath him.                  

                            JAKE
                      (looking down at her,
                       smiles)
                  Tell the truth, Janey is this a
                  great affair, or what?

                            JANE
                  I don't know. It's my first.

                            JAKE
                      (climbing down)
                  We don't even have to have sex and
                  it's fun.
                      (arrives next to her)
                  I wish I could sleep over.

                            JANE
                  I gotta tell my shrink about this.
                  This is a lot to handle. I guess
                  you should go ... I'm sure yoga's
                  probably closed by now.
                            (MORE)
                                                         60.
                    JANE(cont'd)
          Oh, you got a little ice cream on
          your shirt. Let me get that out.

                    JAKE
          It's okay...

Jake takes Jane in his arms and gives her a deep hug. He
lingers, kissing her neck, smelling her skin. She kisses him
on the cheek. He slides her robe off her shoulder. He
softly caresses her shoulder, kissing it, then makes his way
up her neck.   Jane gives in and kisses Jake fully on the
lips. He pulls her close, her robe falling.

                    JANE
          Wow, wow, wow...what's happening,
          Jake?

The Phone RINGS.   Jane pauses.                                 
                    JAKE                                        
          Don't get it.                                         
                      JANE
          I always get it. I have three
          kids.
              (Jake wishes she wouldn't.
                She hesitates, picks it
                up)
          Hello. Hiii...
              (makes an I told you so
                face)
          You still on the plane? How was
          Luke when you left? Oh, that                          
          sounds like fun. Let me know what
          I can bring..... No! Don't have                       
          any idea where he is.
              (points to Jake)
          Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow.
              (hangs up)
          Now I'm lying...... Lauren and                        
          Harley are giving Luke a graduation
          party this weekend. Sweet, huh?

Jake's CELL PHONE RINGS, sees it's Lauren calling.

                    JAKE
              (into phone)
          Hello stranger. Welcome back.

Jane OPENS THE DOOR and Jake darts over for a quick kiss and
then EXITS toward his car. They wave to one another.
                                                               61.



                         JAKE
                   (into phone)
               -- Just getting in my car. This                        
               weekend? Sounds great. Let me
               know what I can bring...

     Jake looks to Jane. She shakes her head -- he's shameless.
     Jake shrugs. Jane watches as Jake drives off, talking on his
     cell.


54   EXT. SANTA BARBARA STREET - EARLY MORNING                  54
     Jane paces outside of a medical building, holding a box from
     her bakery.   She's clearly waiting for someone.

     She spots a comfortably dressed MAN IN HIS MID FORTIES           
     holding the leash of an Airedale and approaching the             
     building's entrance.

                          JANE
                   (approaching him)
               Dr. Allen!

                         DR. ALLEN
                   (surprised to see her)
               Jane. Hi. Am I seeing you today?                       
                         JANE
               No, I just need to talk...and I was                    
               wondering if there was any chance
               you could squeeze me in for an
               emergency session. I'm sort of
               desperate for some advice. I
               brought you some of that coffee
               cake you like. Not as a bribe or
               anything...

                         DR. ALLEN
                   (checks his watch)
               I only have twenty minutes until my
               first patient.

                         JANE
               That's fine. I'll talk fast.                           


55   INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER          55
     Jane, Dr. Allen and the Dog walk the corridor.                   
                                                               62.



                          JANE
                    (whispering)
                So, at this point, I just need some                   
                sound, unbiased guidance. Is                          
                having an affair with you know who
                a good thing or a bad thing?
                    (they stop at Dr. Allen's
                     office door)
                It's a bad thing, right? How could
                it be good?

                          DR. ALLEN
                    (opening his door)
                It's not good. It's not bad.

     Oh, man.   Not what she needs to hear.                           

56   INT. OFFICE                                                56
     Jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair.   Dr. Allen
     turns on a few lamps as his dog settles.                         
                          DR. ALLEN
                You know, things happen in life and                   
                our job is to find out why. What                      
                we have to do is take a real look
                at this. Are you ready to do that?

                          JANE
                I am. Definitely. I've made a list                    
                of what this can possibly be
                about...at my end. Can I read it
                to you?

                           DR. ALLEN                                  
                    (taking his seat)                                 
                Of course.                                            
                          JANE
                    (digging out her                                  
                     Blackberry)                                      
                Thanks. I e-mailed it to myself.                      
                    (reads from Blackberry)
                Okay. Am I still trying to figure
                out why the marriage failed? Do I
                want to get back together? Do we
                have unfinished business? Is this                     
                about revenge?   Am I just...                         
                lonely? Or, is it my "caretaker"                      
                thing?
                          (MORE)
                                                       63.
                    JANE(cont'd)
          You know, the kids are finally gone                
          and now all of a sudden Jake's back
          and I get to take care of him in
          some way...

Dr. Allen nods, impressed with the work she's done.          
                    JANE                                     
          And, listen, I get how therapy                     
          works, I do... We look at things,                  
          we examine them, weeks turn into
          months, what....? we're going on                   
          eight years, right?.... and I'm                    
          okay with that, I like it... but in
          this case, I need to know what you
          really think. Like, I'd like you                   
          to say... Don't do this, it's
          absolutely wrong or go ahead,
          you'll be fine. I actually want to
          be told what to do.

                    DR. ALLEN
          What's interesting is I'm already
          seeing you open up more than I have
          in some time. I'm thinking,                        
          through this affair, you may learn                 
          to view the world in a different
          way.

                    JANE
          I'm sorry. I need more concrete.
          Are you saying I should keep seeing
          him? Because, honestly, if the                     
          guilt and fear could go away, maybe
          I could let go a little and figure                 
          this out.

                    DR. ALLEN
          I wouldn't resist looking at this.

                    JANE
              (mulls that over quickly)                      
          Okay... and another way of saying                  
          that is....?

                    DR. ALLEN
          Let go Jane. It can't hurt.                        
Jane fist pumps in the air.
                                                              64.




57   INT. SANTA BARBARA FERTILITY CENTER RECEPTION - DAY          57
     Jake is in the Waiting Room with several other "Older" Men
     all with their much younger Wives.   A Nurse ENTERS, holding       
     a chart.

                         NURSE
               Jacob Adler?                                             
     Jake rises.   One of the younger women whispers...

                         WOMAN
               Have fun...                                              


58   INT. FERTILITY CENTER OFFICES                                58
     The Nurse shows Jake into a windowless room with a sink, a
     pleather barcalounger, a TV and a DVD player.

                          NURSE
               Okay, you know the drill. You can
               hang your things in the closest,
               the remote is on top of the TV and
               the materials are in the drawers.
                   (cleaning the remote with
                     an anti-bacterial wipe)
               Please deposit your specimen in the
               cup and I'll see you when you're
               done.

     She dims the light before leaving.

     Jake takes off his jacket, tosses it on the chair, slips off
     his shoes, takes off his pants, sits for a sec when his PHONE
     RINGS. He looks at the name of the caller. Smiles.

                          JAKE
               Hi.

59   JANE WALKS QUICKLY THROUGH A FARMER'S MARKET ON HER CELL. 59

                         JANE
                   (on her cell)
               Hey, where are you?

                         JAKE
               At the office.

                         JANE
               Want to grab some lunch?
                                                              65.



                         JAKE
               Absolutely. When?

                         JANE
               Can you do it now? I have about an
               hour. Thought we could go to The                       
               Stanhope....get room service.                          
                   (she's nervous just saying
                    it)

                         JAKE
                   (rising)
               Be there in ten!

                         JANE
               See you there, Adler.

                         JAKE
                   (hangs up)                                         
               She's comin' back!

     Jake rushes to put on his pants, catches his foot in the
     pant's hem, hops to safety. He reaches for his jacket then
     grabs an anti-bacterial wipe, using it to turn the door knob.


60   INT. THE STANHOPE LOBBY/CAFE - DAY                        60     
     Harley and Lauren are having lunch in the CAFE connected to
     the Lobby. Harley has a clear view of the Lobby's Reception
     Desk. Lauren has her back to it.

                         LAUREN
               -- Luke's so excited about his
               party. We can fit forty people in
               our place, can't we?

                         HARLEY
               Sure, if nobody wants to sit                           
               down...                                                
                   (notices JAKE ENTERING the
                    hotel)
               -- Hey, there's your...

     Harley then realizes JAKE IS signing the Register and            
     CHECKING IN and chokes on his French Fry.

                          LAUREN
               My what...
                   (starts to turn)

     Harley grabs Lauren's face in his hands and kisses her, even
     though he's choking. He coughs while kissing her.
                                                         66.



                       LAUREN
          Harley!!!

                    HARLEY
          I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spit on
          you. I just needed to kiss you.

                    LAUREN
          While you were choking?

                       HARLEY
          It worked.     I'm not choking
          anymore.

Harley swallows a cough, reaching for his water, HIS EYES ON
JAKE as Jake is HANDED A ROOM KEY and POINTED TOWARD THE
ELEVATOR. Harley drinks his entire glass of water as he
watches.

                    LAUREN
              (turning)
          Who did you just see?

Luckily Jake is now gone.

                    HARLEY
          No one. Thought it was your
          cousin...but...

Harley falls silent as he SEES JANE ENTER THE HOTEL AND CROSS
TO THE RECEPTION DESK. After a sec, she's pointed toward the
same elevator.                                                   
                    HARLEY
          Ohhhh my sweet Lord....

                    LAUREN
              (looks up from her salad)
          Now what?

                     HARLEY
          Honey, I totally forgot I have a
          conference call at 1:15, I gotta
          get back to the office. Waiter!
          Honey, stop eating, get the waiter.
          Call the one over there.
              (pointing her away from
               Jane)

                    LAUREN
          Harley, we can't leave, we're
          meeting with the Wedding
          Specialist.
                                                                67.



                          HARLEY
                   (watches as Jake waits for
                    Jane around the corner)                            
               Yeah, you know what? Today's not a
               good idea to do that.                                   
                   (Sees Jane join Jake, they                          
                    step into the elevator                             
                    and immediately fall into                          
                    each other's arms and                              
                    kiss)                                              
               Oh my God...!!!                                         


61   INT. JAKE AND JANE'S HOTEL ROOM - UPSTAIRS - SAME TIME      61
     The curtains are drawn,   the lights are low. Jane, in a hotel
     robe, slips a cd in the   cd player and we hear a mellow song,
     perfect for love in the   afternoon. The Bathroom Door OPENS
     and Jake EXITS, also in   a hotel robe.

     Jane stands across the room from him. They smile at one
     another. From behind, we see Jane untie her robe, letting it
     fall to the floor. Jake looks at her, from head to toe and
     back. They smile at one another, then something comes over
     Jake. His eyes roll back, his legs give out and he collapses
     against the wall.

                         JANE
               Jake!!!                                                 


62   INT. LOBBY CAFE - SAME TIME                                 62
     The Hotel's Wedding Specialist has joined Lauren and Harley's
     table. She holds a binder filled with photos. Harley is a
     mess, knowing what's going on upstairs.

                         WEDDING SPECIALIST
               I adore October weddings. Let me
               show you what we did last October.

     She opens her Book of Photos for Lauren. Lauren gasps.

                         HARLEY
                   (rising)
               Honey, I'm gonna make that phone
               call from the...

     Lauren and the Wedding Specialist don't look up and don't
     hear him. They keep talking to each other.
                                                              68.



                          HARLEY
                   (nods)
               -- Okay. Good. You just keep doing
               that and I'll...                                      
     They still don't look up. Harley nervously HEADS FOR THE        
     LOBBY when he spots the HOTEL DOCTOR, bag in hand, arriving
     at the Reception Desk.

                         HOTEL DOC
               What's the room number?

                         RECEPTION CLERK                             
               408. Adler. His wife said he's                        
               conscious now...

                          HOTEL DOC
                   (taking off)
               On my way.

     Harley stops in his tracks, freaking.   Adler???


63   INT. JANE AND JAKE'S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER           63
     Jake is under the covers, in his robe, a blood pressure cuff
     around his arm. Jane, still in her robe, paces. The Hotel
     Doc sits on a chair next to Jake's side of the bed.

                         HOTEL DOC
               Your blood pressure's good.

                         JANE
               How's his heart?

                         HOTEL DOC
               Do you have a heart condition, Mr.
               Adler?

                          JAKE
               No.   And I just had a check up.

                          JANE
               You did?   Oh, that's good.

                         HOTEL DOC
                   (listening to his heart)
               Deep breath. So, no chest pain?

                          JAKE
               None.
                                                69.



                    HOTEL DOC
          When you got dizzy, did you feel
          your heart was beating funny?

                    JAKE
          Yes, but I was admiring my
          beautiful...
              (indicates Jane)

Jane holds up her weak eyelid.

                    HOTEL DOC
          -- Well that's nice to hear after
          all these years...
              (winds up his stethoscope)
          Did you forget to take any of your
          medications today?

                    JAKE
          Took `em all.

                    HOTEL DOC
          What all did you take?                      
                    JAKE
          Uh....Lipitor, baby aspirin..               
              (whispers)
          Flomax.

                    JANE
              (sitting on the bed)
          Flomax?

                     JAKE
               (embarrassed)
          Yes, otherwise I pee 40 times a
          day.

                    HOTEL DOC
          How long have you been taking the           
          Flomax?

                    JAKE
          Not that long. And I only take it
          sporadically. I have to sneak it
          actually.
              (explains confidentially)
          It reduces semen and that's not
          good for my wife right now.
              (to Jane)
          Sorry.
                                                              70.



                            HOTEL DOC
                      (looks over at Jane)
                  Really..?

                            JANE
                  Yes, I prefer a lot of semen.
                  Always have.
                      (rises)
                  Okay, well, thank you so much for                   
                  coming. Looks like he's gonna live,
                  so...

                            HOTEL DOC
                      (packing up)
                  Yeah, my guess is Flomax is
                  probably the culprit here. It can
                  definitely give you a sudden drop
                  in blood pressure so I suggest you
                  stay off it for a few weeks, which
                  apparently your wife will
                  appreciate.
                      (holds in a chuckle)

                             JANE
                  Yeah.   Really good for me.

     The Doctor snaps his bag shut, rises.

                            HOTEL DOC
                  And I suggest you rest quietly for
                  the rest of the afternoon.
                      (to Jane)
                  No hanky panky, Mrs. Adler.

                            JANE
                  No chance. I assure you.


64   INT. LOBBY                                                64
     Harley sits on a bench with his head between his legs. Lauren
     arrives, joins him on the bench.

                            LAUREN
                  Are you acting like this because of
                  the wedding? Tell me the truth?

                            HARLEY
                      (head down)
                  Not at all. Swear to God.
                                                             71.



                         LAUREN
               Because I don't want to be one of
               those couples where the guy goes
               into a coma the whole time we plan
               the wedding. It's not worth it to
               me.

     Harley looks up, sees the Hotel Doc walk by the Reception
     Clerk. The Doc gives her a wink and a "thumbs up" and keeps
     on walking.

                         HARLEY
                   (deep sigh, rises)
               Okay! We're back in business!


65   OPRAH - CLOSE - ON TV                                    65
     In Jane and Jake's room.

     REVERSE - JANE AND JAKE

     Sitting up in bed, in their robes, watching Oprah and eating
     chicken soup on trays. Jake reaches for the salt. Jane
     eases it away from him. Jake looks over at Jane, oozing with
     love and appreciation.

                         JAKE
               See. Just that move...you have no                     
               idea. Not everyone's like that...

                         JANE
                   (mutes Oprah, then:)
               Jake, I have a confession to make.                    
               Back when we broke up... I knew it
               wasn't all your fault.

                         JAKE
               You mean that?   You've never said
               that to me before.                                    
                         JANE
               I know. Because when you cheated,                     
               I didn't have to. But I think in
               some way, I gave up on us and I'm
               not sure you ever really did.

                         JAKE
               I still haven't.


     Jake takes Jane's hand. She looks down at his wedding ring,
     then turns her eyes back to Oprah. A beat, then:
                                                                72.



                         JANE
               Are you and Agness... still having
               sex?

     Jake doesn't answer.    Jane turns, looks right at him.

                         JAKE
               Only if she initiates it.

     Jane GROANS.                                                      
                          JAKE
               I'm trying not to rock the boat at
               home until you and I figure this
               out.
                    (sees her reaction)
               This is a little trickier at my end
               than yours.

                         JANE
               Right. Yeah. Okay....                                   
                   (rises...)
               Now I know you're gonna think I'm                       
               leaving because of what you just                        
               said, but I'm not. I really have
               to get back to work.

                         JAKE
                   (takes Jane's hand)
               We got really close there for a
               moment.

     She knows he's right. Jane's Cell RINGS.     She lets it ring
     again, then answers it.

                         JANE
                   (into phone)
               Hello?

66   ADAM - AT HIS OFFICE                                        66
                         ADAM
                   (into phone)
               Hi, hope I'm not interrupting
               anything.

     INTERCUT JANE AND ADAM

                            JANE
               Adam! Oh!     Hi.
                                                               73.



     Jake is instantly jealous.   He rises, crosses to the closet,
     starts dressing, his eyes glued to Jane who seems to be very
     engaged by Adam.

                         ADAM
               I just found out there's a French
               Film Festival in town and that made
               me think of you so I was wondering
               if you'd like to go to the opening
               night tomorrow night.
                   (a little nervous... will
                    she accept?)

                         JANE
               Oh, that sounds so fun...
                   (Jake rolls his eyes)
               Let me think, tomorrow's what?

                         JAKE
                   (desperate, whispers)
               -- Say you're busy. Agness has a
               dinner thing tomorrow, I can come
               over.
                   (Jane hesitates)
               Please.

                         JANE
               Oh, um, you know, I'd really love
               to, but, my son is coming home from
               college the next day and I have a
               bunch of things I have to do to get
               ready...
                   (hates lying, Jake crosses
                    to her, smiles)
               I'm so sorry.

                         ADAM
               No, don't worry. No problem. Maybe
               we can see something another night.

                         JANE
               Absolutely. I would love that.                         
     Jake smiles appreciatively, crosses to Jane, hugs her.           


67   ADAM HANGS UP                                              67
     We see he is holding Two Movie Tickets. He looks at them
     then crosses to the desk of a Female Worker.
                                                              74.



                          ADAM
               Melanie, how would you and your
               husband like two tickets to the
               opening of the French Film
               Festival? Reserved seats...VIP
               parking...

                            FEMALE WORKER
               Seriously?


68   INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              68
     Jane and Jake are finishing getting dressed, moving about,
     putting on shoes, blouses, ties, jackets, belts...                 
                         JAKE
               You'll make the whole thing?    The
               roast chicken, the---

                         JANE
               -- mashed potatoes, sauteed string
               beans and double fudge chocolate                         
               cake. I know your favorite dinner,
               Jakey.

                         JAKE
                   (touched)
               You haven't called me Jakey in 10
               years. This has been a great day
               for us. So, do we have a date?                           
                         JANE
                   (fixes Jake's hair)
               We have a date.                                          
     Jake grabs his heart. Jane leans on him, a smile on her face       
     as we begin to HEAR MUSIC.                                         


69   EXT. JANE'S PATIO -    LATE DAY - MUSIC OVER                 69
     Music plays from the outdoor speakers. Jane sets the table in      
     her courtyard. She's singing along with the music.                 

70   A PERFECT CAKE - MUSIC OVER                                  70
     sits on the Kitchen Counter. Jane finishes off icing the
     cake like the pro she is then peeks into the oven, looks at        
     her perfect roast chicken.                                         

71   OMIT                                                         71
                                                              75.




72   INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - MUSIC OVER                             72
     Jane clips the price tag off of a new dress and slips it off       
     its hanger.


73   A CLOCK ON A NIGHT STAND                                     73
     tells us it's 8:45.

     ON JAKE

     His eyes glued to the clock. We are IN JAKE AND AGNESS'
     BEDROOM. Jake and Agness lie on their bed, both doing paper
     work. Pedro is asleep between them. Jake gets up, slipping         
     his cell into his hand.                                            
                         AGNESS
                   (not looking at him)
               Why are you taking your cell to the
               bathroom?

                         JAKE
               Oh. Didn't mean to.
                   (places it back on the
                    night stand)

                         AGNESS
               Carry him to his bed, will you?

     Jake carefully lifts Pedro off the bed.

                         AGNESS
                   (while reading)
               And hurry back. I'm ovulating.

                           JAKE
               You are?

                         AGNESS
               Why do you think I cancelled my
               dinner?

     Agness pulls her t-shirt over her head... she is gorgeous.


74   INT. PEDRO'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               74
     Jake gently lies Pedro in his bed, pulls up the covers. Pedro
     takes Jake's hand, holds it to his chest, looking up at him.       
     Jake offers a comforting smile and Pedro closes his eyes.
                                                               76.


     Jake sits on the bed and lets Pedro fall back asleep, holding
     onto his hand.                                                   


75   EXT. JANE'S PATIO - NIGHT                                  75
     Candles are lit on the table, but are now low. The table is      
     set with flowers from the garden. The wine has not been          
     opened. CAMERA CRANES to FIND Jane INSIDE THE KITCHEN, still
     dressed for dinner and deep in thought. She then sighs very      
     deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by
     room, the house becomes dark.


76   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY - 6 P.M.                  76
     The Kids cars are in the driveway.


77   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME                        77
     Jane, Gabby, Lauren and Harley are in the kitchen, cooking,      
     setting the table, opening wine, chatting.

                         LAUREN                                       
               -- Oh, Mom, I keep forgetting to                       
               tell you about our meeting at The                      
               Stanhope. We went there for lunch                      
               two days ago and met with their                        
               Wedding Specialist....I think that                     
               could be the place, Mom....                            
                         JANE
               Two days ago you went to The                           
               Stanhope...for lunch?                                  
                         HARLEY
               Yes and guess what?    We saw                          
               nothing.                                               
     Jane and Harley connect.    He immediately looks away.           
                         LAUREN                                       
               What is that supposed to mean?                         
                         HARLEY                                       
               Who wants wine? Anyone?                                
                   (starts pouring)                                   
                         GABBY                                        
                   (looking in the fridge)                            
               Mom, you have an insane amount of
               food in here, even for you.
                                                        77.



                    JANE
              (taking out last night's
               roast chicken)
          I knew you were all going to be
          here for the weekend so I made a
          bunch of stuff last night.

                    LAUREN                                      
          Looks like Jake Adler's favorite
          meal to me.

                    JANE
              (laughs)
          Very funny.

                       HARLEY                                   
          Very.                                                 
Jane looks to Harley again when they all hear a car horn        
HONK. Jane LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and sees JAKE'S PORSCHE PULL    
UP with Luke in the passenger seat. The Girls rush out the      
Kitchen door. Harley sees Jake getting out of the car and       
pours himself a larger glass of wine as Jane approaches him.    
                       JANE                                     
          Harley?                                               
Just then, Luke enters and Jane lights up.                      
                    JANE
          Yay!!!!
              (hugs Luke)

                    LUKE
              (surveying all the food)
          Mom, this looks amazing.

Harley and Luke hug, talk the talk. `Sup? Yo...

                       JAKE
                 (sheepishly joins the
                  group, eyes on Jane)
          Hi.

                       JANE
                 (briskly)
          Hey.

Harley takes a huge gulp of his wine.                           
                    JAKE
              (holding Luke's backpack)
          Where should I put this...?
                                                         78.



                    JANE
              (turns her back on him,
               making herself busy)
          Wherever.

Harley watches their interaction tennis match style. Jake
looks at the table set for five, wishes he was joining them.
He sees last night's dinner, now being served as left overs.
Jane slices the roast chicken.

                    JAKE
          That looks incredible.                                
Jane looks up at him, knife poised.    Is he kidding?

                      JANE
          Thanks.

She goes at the chicken with the knife, slicing off a leg.
Jake flinches.

                     HARLEY
          Jake?   Glass of wine?

                      JAKE
          Uh, sure.    Thanks.

                      HARLEY
          Jane?

                    JANE
              (not looking up)
          No thank you.

Jake's cell RINGS.    He turns his back to take it.

                    JAKE
              (into cell)
          Hi Ag... Just got here.

Jane has a hot flash.    Starts fanning herself.

                    JAKE
              (into cell)
          Okay, I will. Yeah, no, I know.
              (turns back to the family)
          I'm sorry guys, I gotta hit it.

                      JANE
          Bye-bye.

The Girls look to Jane.
                                     79.



          JAKE
I have to stop at the market.
Agness is making some pasta thing
and she ran out of olive oil.

          GABBY                            
Hey, at least she's finally
cooking.

          JAKE
So...see everybody at the party
tomorrow...                                
           LAUREN
Yeah.   It's gonna be so fun.

          JANE
    (to Lauren)
I told you I'm bringing someone,
right?

            LAUREN
No. Who?

           JANE
Adam.   My architect.

          JAKE
You're bringing your architect?

            JANE
Yes I am.

          JAKE
Like as a date?

          JANE
    (looking right at him)
Yeah.

          GABBY                            
I like the idea.

            JANE
Me too.

          HARLEY
Yeah, seems like it should round
out everything really nicely.
    (pouring another drink)
Nobody wants wine but me?
                                                               80.



     Luke opens a cupboard, takes out a bottle of olive oil, hands
     it to Jake.

                         LUKE
               Here, now you can stay another five
               minutes.
                   (catches Jane's eye)
               You have three bottles in there.

                         JAKE
               Janey, can I talk to you privately?
               Just for a sec.

     Jane heads out still holding the carving knife.   Harley slips
     the knife out of her hand.

                         HARLEY
               There you go....
                   (to Kids)
               Somebody's talkin' graduation gift.


78   INT. COURTYARD                                             78
     Jane and Jake stand in the courtyard off of the Living Room.

                         JANE
               What is it, Jake?   What?

                         JAKE
               I don't get not calling me back.

                          JANE
               `Cause I don't care what your
               excuse is.
                   (shuts the door to the
                    living )

                         JAKE
               She didn't go out, Jane. She
               cancelled her plans and every
               time I tried to call or write, she
               caught me. I wanted to be here.

                         JANE
               You know what, Jake? You were
               worried about rocking the boat at
               home? Well now you're rocking my                        
               boat and I don't like it.

                         JAKE
                   (stopping her)
               Honey, don't let one night...
                                       81.



          JANE
You don't understand. I'm not even
blaming you. I fully participated
in this. But I don't want to do it
anymore. The last thing in the
world I should be right now is your
mistress, sitting around at nine at
night wearing heels and perfume and
blowing out candles and wrapping
everything in Saran Wrap because
your wife cancelled her plans. It
was cliche and humiliating.

          JAKE
    (wistfully)
You lit candles?

          JANE
Oh, shut up. Look, I've had a
pretty good life these past 10
years. I figured it out and I
moved on. I no longer feel alone
or divorced. I just feel normal.
You know how long that took, just
to get my balance back?

          JAKE
No.

          JANE
The point is, I'm going in the
wrong direction here. But the
worst part is... It's feeling like
it used to feel. All the little
untruths that are hard to catch but
add up...

           JAKE
-- Janey, c'mon, it was one
mistake...

          HARLEY
    (joining them)
-- Everything okay out here?
    (Jane and Jake turn)
The kids are gettin' hungry...

          JANE
Yeah. We're done.
    (walks away, pauses in
     front of Harley)
We were just...
                                                            82.



                    HARLEY
              (as she passes)
          -- None of my beeswax, Jane.
              (once she's gone)
          And please never tell me.

 Lauren joins.                                                    
                       LAUREN
          What's up?

                    JAKE
          Nothin', punky.
              (rubs her arm)

                    LAUREN
              (taking Jake back inside)                           
          Yeah? So, we're going to see you                        
          tomorrow night, for sure, right?                        
Harley starts to follow them out when Jane grabs his shirt        
sleeve.                                                           
                    JANE                                          
          Okay...What did you see and what do                     
          you know?                                               
                    HARLEY                                        
          Nothing. Really.                                        
Jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone.          
                    HARLEY                                        
              (confesses rapidly)                                 
          Okay, he checked in, you arrived,                       
          you met in the elevator, possible                       
          kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor                      
          came down, thumbs up. That's it.                        
          Have no idea what happened in                           
          between.                                                
                    JANE                                          
              (dying...)                                          
          Have you told Lauren?                                   
                    HARLEY                                        
          No and I won't --                                       
                    LUKE                                          
              (joining them)                                      
          Mom. Dad's leaving...                                   
                                                                 83.




      INT. HOUSE                                                        
      Jane and Harley ENTER from the courtyard just as Jake is          
      about to leave. Jane immediately crosses to the table which       
      now has dinner on it.                                             
      Lauren kisses Jake good-bye on the cheek then joins the           
      others who are about to sit down for dinner.                      
                             LUKE
                       (from the Dining Room)                           
                   Thanks for picking me up, Dad...

      Jake pauses awkwardly at the door. He can't catch Jane's          
      eye. He waves to the kids, who don't seem to notice then          
      heads out.                                                        

      EXT. HOUSE                                                        
      Jake EXITS, turns back, looks INSIDE THE DINING ROOM, sees        
      his family sitting around the table, talking, laughing. He        
      heads toward his car as...                                        
      JANE

      glances out the window at Jake as he drives off. One of the       
      kids says something, distracting her, and she laughs...


A80   EXT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - THE NEXT NIGHT          A80
      Harley and Luke, on ladders, are stringing paper lanterns
      across a small patio. Lauren crosses under them, carrying a
      tray of food and joins Gabby who is setting out drinks.           

      OMIT                                                              

81    IN THE BATHROOM                                             81
      Jane sits at her dressing table, dressed for the party. She       
      puts on hoop earrings -- likes the way she looks. She opens       
      a drawer to take out a lipstick.

      INSERT - THE DRAWER

      Sitting among her cosmetics is the joint Jake left for her.
      She looks at the joint, then looks at herself in the mirror.      
                                                                 84.




82   ADAM - WALKING UP THE PATH TO THE HOUSE - 15 MINUTES LATER 82

     He looks adorable and carries a gift the size of a book.    He
     knocks in a playful rhythm.

     JANE ANSWERS THE DOOR

     all smiles.

                          JANE
               Hey....


     REVERSE - ON ADAM

     Very happy to see her.

                          ADAM
               Hey.   You look fantastic.

                         JANE
               I'm feelin' a little fantastic.

     She OPENS THE DOOR A LITTLE WIDER and we NOW SEE she's eating
     a gi-normous piece of cake.

                         ADAM
                   (trying not to react to
                    that, ENTERS, handing her
                    the gift.)
               This is for you.

                          JANE
               Really? Thank you! Come on in.
                   (takes a huge bite of
                    cake)
               Can you hold this for a sec?
                   (hands him the cake plate)
               Oh my God...
                   (takes another bite)
               -- this could be the best cake I
               ever made. You want a piece? It's
               like... beyond...

                         ADAM
               I think I'm good.

                         JANE
                   (focusing on the gift)
               I can't believe you brought me a
               gift?! So nice!
                                                              85.



     Jane unwraps the gift, turns it around, looks at it.

                         JANE
               An appointment book?

                         ADAM
               I sort of assumed you didn't have
               one.

                         JANE
               --Because I never remember our...
               Awww....

                         ADAM
               I took the liberty of filling in
               our next two meetings. And marked
               them with post-its and wrote them
               in red and then highlighted them in
               neon yellow.

                            JANE
               Thank you!

     Jane kisses Adam on the cheek just as he was moving and the
     kiss lands on his lips.

                            JANE
               Sorry.

                         ADAM
               I'm not.
                   (Did he really say that?
                    Then, he licks his lips)
               Wow, that cake is good.

     Jane laughs a little too hard.


83   INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT                          83
                         JANE
               So, let me ask you something and
               please don't think I'm weird or out
               of line or anything... but do you
               by any chance poke smot?                              
                            ADAM
               Do I...??

                         JANE
               I mean do you smoke pot?! I
               haven't asked anyone that question
               since I was twenty-two.
                                                         86.



                    ADAM
          Uh. No, I don't. But I have. But
          I don't think I've had any since my
          kids were born...so not in like 27
          years.

                    JANE
          Oh my God, we have kids the same
          age! And I haven't had any since
          my kids were born either!!! Except
          for tonight. I had one hit off of
          this.

Jane pulls the joint out of her purse, just as they pull up
next to a Police Car.

                     ADAM
          You might not want to hold that
          quite so...
              (nods)
          Hello Officer.

                    JANE
              (turns, SEES the Cop Car,
               GASPS and DROPS THE
               JOINT, then TURNS to Cop,
               waves, then:)                                   
          I actually know him! Blueberry
          scone and a latte.
              (the Cop nods, pulls away)
          Oh my God! That was horrifying. I
          instantly saw myself in a mug shot.
          My heart is leaping out of my...
              (then distracted)
          Wow... This is the most insane
          dashboard I've ever seen. It's like
          we're in a cockpit. It's
          spectacular. Adam, what kind of
          car is this?

                      ADAM
          Jane?

                      JANE
                (turns to him)
          Hi.

                    ADAM
          Did you get this high from one hit?
                                                               87.



                         JANE
               Yes! I don't know what they've                           
               done to pot over the last 30 years
               but it rockkkkks!                                        


84   EXT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - NIGHT                    84
     From OUTSIDE, we can see lots of folks in the Living Room.
     Candles dot the path up to the cottage door. Several Couples
     and College Kids are walking toward the house.

85   ANGLE - BEHIND NEARBY BUSHES                                85
     Jane and Adam are sharing the joint.   Jane takes a tiny, lady-
     like hit, passes it to Adam.

                         JANE
                   (whispers)
               Don't take too much, it's really
               strong.

     She blows out the smoke. Adam, on the other hand, takes a
     huge hit.

                         ADAM
                   (while holding in the
                    smoke)
               I haven't had fun in almost three
               years, Jane.
                   (takes another huge hit)
               Bring. It. On.


     SOME COLLEGE KIDS

     walk past the bushes.

                         KID
               Who's got the reefer?                                    
                         ADAM (O.S.)
                   (fake falsetto)
               No one. Keep walking please.

     The Kids laugh.


86   INT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER            86
     Jane and Adam, two very straight laced grown ups, ENTER the
     party, pausing as they peruse the crowd.
                                                                 88.



                            JANE
                  How you feeling?

                            ADAM
                  Totally fine.

                            JANE
                  Me too.

     Adam starts to move to the music insanely well and then just
     insanely. Lauren and Harley greet them. Jane greets them
     back with a huge hug.

                            JANE
                  Hi... love your dress.   Hey Harls.

                            HARLEY
                      (that's weird...)
                  Harls...?

                            JANE
                  Adam, this is my oldest, Lauren and
                  her fiance, Harley.                                   
                      (giggles to Kids)
                  We're on a date.

     Adam and Jane stifle laughs.


87   AT THE BAR - WIDE - MOMENTS LATER                            87
     Jane and Adam chat with all the Kids.     Looks like it's going
     great -- Adam is a big hit.                                        
     ON JAKE - WATCHING FROM ACROSS THE ROOM

     Jake nurses a drink and is not looking happy. He sees the
     Kids disperse, finishes off his vodka, ready to make his
     move.

     ON JANE AND ADAM

     Now alone.    They haven't seen Jake yet.

                             ADAM
                      (starts moving to the                             
                       music - Jane laughs)                             
                  By the way -- How great is this
                  party? Let's be the last to leave.                    
                      (bops to the MUSIC then
                       SPOTS JAKE ACROSS THE
                       ROOM, seriously eyeing
                       him.)
                             (MORE)
                                                           89.
                    ADAM(cont'd)
          Hey, there's your ex-husb-- Uh-Oh.                     
          He's headed right toward us. Not                       
          the time to be "feeling groovy"                        
              (dances again when he sees                         
               Jake in SLOW-MO getting                           
               closer and closer)
          Oooo. Why so intense, big fella?

Adam slides a bit behind Jane as Jake arrives with Agness who
looks inappropriately youthful.

                    JAKE
          Hello Jane.... Adam.

                    ADAM
              (all smiles)                                       
          Hey, good to see you again.

                    JANE
          Adam, this is Agness, Jake's
          wife...
              (suddenly realizing)
          Now that is an odd sentence for me
          to say since that was me for most
          of my life. Seriously. How weird
          is that? Both of us married to the
          same man!

                    AGNESS
              (dismissing the idea)
          You know... it's... hey, what are                      
          you gonna do?

                    JAKE
          Yeah, why go there.

At this point, Adam gets hit with a severe case of the           
giggles. As the rest continue, he can't keep a straight          
face.                                                            
                    JANE
          Because there, is...fascinating. I
          mean, when you think about it, it
          sort of links us in some cosmic                        
          crazy way, doesn't it, Agness? Of                      
          all the men on the planet, we both
          said "I do" to this guy.

                    AGNESS
          Yeah. Twenty-five years apart. I
          know you're having like an "Ah-Ha'
          moment, but I think I'm gonna get a
          refill. Adam, good meeting you.
                                                                 90.



                         ADAM
                   (whispers to Jane as                                 
                    Agness exits)                                       
               She's got a really scary tattoo.                         
                          JAKE
               Janey, can I talk to you for a
               quick sec?

     Jake nods his head toward the bathroom and heads for it. Jane
     looks to Adam.                                                     
                         JANE
               He always needs me for a quick sec.
                   (starts to exit)                                     
               You okay?                                                
                         ADAM                                           
               Oh, I'm very okay!                                       


88   INT. TINY BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER                           88
     Jane and Jake are crammed into an extremely tight space.

                         JAKE
               What's going on?    You're acting
               insane.

                         JANE
                   (whispers giddily)
               I'm stoned.

                         JAKE
               What?! You smoked the joint I gave
               you?

                         JANE
               You told me to!    It's a-mazing!!!

                         JAKE
               But you weren't supposed to smoke
               it with him, you're supposed to
               smoke it with me!

                         JANE
               Somebody's jealous....

                         JAKE
               Yes, of course. Why shouldn't I
               be... you're my...
                                                         91.



                     JANE
          -- What?   What am I, Jake?

                    JAKE
          You're my ex-wife, lover, oldest
          friend and girlfriend.

Jane blurts out a laugh.

                    JANE
          Okay. You're hilarious. And
          because of that, even though I kind
          of hate you/love you, I'm going to
          let you have some...

                    JAKE
          You love me? I mean, I heard "hate"
          had top billing, but...

Jane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands
it to Jake. Just as she does that, THE DOOR OPENS and HARLEY
ENTERS, thinking the bathroom is free. Jake quickly yanks
him in, shuts the door, locks it. Harley is now caught
between Jane and Jake and a cloud of smoke.

                    HARLEY
          Oh my God, you're smoking weed in
          the guest bathroom.

                    JAKE
          Yes we are and we'd appreciate it
          if you didn't tell anyone about
          this.

                       HARLEY
          No. Never.     Adding it to the list.                  
                    JANE
          Care for a toke?

                    HARLEY
          I don't really smoke marijuana.

                     JANE
              (blowing out smoke)
          Me either.

                    HARLEY
          Okay, one hit.

                    JANE
              (looks at herself in the
               mirror)
                    (MORE)
                                                               92.
                         JANE(cont'd)
               Oh, my God. Is that what I look
               like?


89   EXT. BACKYARD PATIO - MOMENTS LATER                          89
     A small group is dancing to a hip hop song on the patio.           
     Adam and Agness are dancing together. They're totally into         
     it. Jane makes her way to the dance floor as the song ends         
     and The Beach Boys "Wouldn't It Be Nice" begins. Jake              
     follows Jane dancing his way toward the crowd, spinning Gabby      
     on his way. Jake takes Jane's hand...dances with her.
     Harley arrives next to Lauren and Gabby who watch their            
     parents.

                         LAUREN
               They must be hammered.

                         HARLEY
               Or something like that.

     Adam glances over and sees Jane and Jake.

                         ADAM
                   (to Agness)
               Sweetest divorced couple in the
               world..!

     Agness is surprised by how happy Jake looks with Jane.

                         JANE
                   (spotting Adam)
               Hey..!
                   (to Jake)
               Jake, I'm gonna....                                      
     Jane and Adam cross toward one another. Jake dies a little
     as Jane leaves him, her eyes on Adam. Jake doesn't notice
     Agness is watching him.. Jane, now dancing with Adam, looks        
     from Adam to Jake then back to Adam and then doesn't look
     back at Jake again.

     Jake is still as he watches the woman he loves slip away.
     Agness has her eyes firmly on Jake, not missing any of it.


90   INT. ADAM'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT                             90
     Adam drives Jane home.   Clearly the end of a great night.         
                         JANE
               Wow. Fun is not overrated, is it?                        
                                                             93.



                         ADAM
               You know what's great?

                          JANE
               What?

                         ADAM
               How much I like you.

                         JANE
                   (really touched)
               Thank you... I really like you a
               lot too.... even though...oh.. you                     
               didn't say, "a lot".

                         ADAM
               But I was thinking it.

                         JANE
               So... I'm not too old for you?

                         ADAM
               How can you be too old for me when
               I'm older than you.

                         JANE
               I just figured all these women you
               get fixed up with are thirty-five.

                         ADAM
               Your age is one of my favorite
               things about you.
                   (she appreciates that)
               Do you think you have any more of
               that chocolate cake at your house?                     
                          JANE
               Hungry?

                          ADAM
               Starved!


91   A BLACK SCREEN - LIGHTS POP ON                             91
     And we are IN THE BAKERY at ONE A.M. Jane turns on a few
     more lights, but keeps it a bit moody.

                         ADAM
               Officially now the best date of my
               life. Pre or post divorce.
                                                                94.



                         JANE
               Get out... All right....so
               basically I can make you anything
               on the menu or even not on the
               menu. Just name it.

                          ADAM
               No?  Really? Okay.                                      
                   (scans the blackboard                               
                    menu)                                              
               What about a... warm chocolate
               croissant?

                         JANE
               My speciality!


92   OMIT                                                        92    



     INT. BAKERY KITCHEN                                               
     JANE FLOURS AND ROLLS CROISSANT DOUGH as Adam, now in an          
     apron, watches, chatting with her. Jane then places the           
     dough in a machine called a Sheeter. The dough slides into        
     the sheeter and then slides back out bigger and flatter.

     ANGLE - JANE AND ADAM - TWO STONERS

     watching the sheeter, mesmerized.

     NEXT Jane folds the flattened dough, measures it with a yard      
     stick, then cuts it into sections. She takes one of the           
     sections, spreads it on a marble slab and very quickly cuts       
     it into triangles. She's a whiz at this.                          
     THEN, Jane shows Adam how to stretch the triangles of             
     dough.... Nervous at first, he gets the hang of it. Then,         
     Jane teaches Adam how to place a bar of chocolate in each         
     triangle and roll it into a croissant. Laughing as they           
     work, they make a dozen croissants... NEXT...into the OVEN.       


93   INT. RESTAURANT - LATER                                     93
     Jane and Adam sit at a table in the corner, a stack of
     croissants piled high between them. Music plays as Adam
     takes the top croissant and Jane takes the next.
                                                     95.



                    ADAM
              (bites into it)
          Oh. Baby.

                    JANE
              (smelling hers)
          Mmmmmmmm.

                    ADAM
          It's crazy how good this is.

                    JANE
              (biting into one, nods)
          Yeah, and I'm not even stoned
          anymore.

                    ADAM
          Neither am I.

                    JANE
              (happy about that)
          Oh, then...merci, Monsieur.

                    ADAM
          Do you remember when I asked you
          the other night, if you were dating
          anyone and you said no... It
          sounded to me like you were maybe
          saying yes.

                    JANE
          I was sort of seeing someone.     But,
          it's over now.
              (Adam nods)
          Honestly.

                    ADAM
          `Cause I'm not strong enough to
          fall for someone who's with someone
          else. Wouldn't be able to take
          that again.

                    JANE
          I understand. I wouldn't say it
          was over if it wasn't.

Adam takes Jane's hand in his...relieved.

                    ADAM
          Great.                                           
Adam turns Jane's hand over and looks at it a bit
quizzically.
                                                              96.



                            JANE
                      (explains)
                  Cooking scar.... From a very hot
                  batch of caramel...

                            ADAM
                  Ooooo. What about that one?

                             JANE
                  That one's from boiling sugar...I
                  wasn't very skilled in the
                  beginning.    And that one is from a
                  large French...

     Adam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar.

                            JANE
                  -- Saute pan.

     Adam then kisses the burn on her forearm. Jane sighs, closes
     her eyes. This feeling is unexpected. She opens her eyes as
     Adam moves closer.

                            ADAM
                  Would it be okay if I...?

     Jane nods.    He kisses her great.

                            ADAM
                  I was going to say, kiss you.

                               JANE
                  I figured.

                            ADAM
                  If you feel this is in any way
                  wrong because we're working
                  together...

                            JANE
                  ... I don't ...

     He smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and
     kiss again.


94   OMIT                                                         94    
                                                            97.




INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY                                
Quiet. Jane enters from the garden, humming, "Wouldn't It Be      
Nice." Luke ENTERS, still looking half asleep in his T Shirt      
and boxers.                                                       
                    JANE
          Hey sleepy! What time did you get
          in?

                    LUKE
          Have no idea. Lauren and Harley
          drove me home.

                    LAUREN
              (joining)
          I'm surprised you remember that.

                    JANE
              (turns to see Lauren)
          Hi. I didn't know you slept here.

Lauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top,
takes out a box of cereal.

                    LAUREN
          We were playing Scattagories with
          Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell                        
          asleep on the couch.

Harley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned PJ
bottoms and a Girl's V-neck T-shirt.

                    LUKE
          Sweet.

                    HARLEY
          I got cold in the middle of the
          night.

Lauren and Jane laugh.

                     JANE
          Okay, who wants what?
              (noticing Gabby entering)                           
          Hi baby...                                              
                    GABBY                                         
              (looks out the front                                
               window)                                            
          What's Dad doing here?                                  
                                                              98.



     Everyone LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and SEES Jake sitting in his
     Porsche.


96   EXT. FRONT PORCH                                             96
     Jane EXITS as Jake steps out of his car. He looks like he's
     had a rough night and has something on his mind. Jane
     cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows are
     all open.

                         JANE
                   (quietly)
               Everything okay?

                         JAKE
               I left Agness.

                         JANE
               No, don't say that.

                         JAKE
               She saw it my eyes, Janey.

                           JANE                                         
               Saw what?

                         JAKE
               That I'm still in love with you.   I
               admitted it, I told her about us
               and I've left her. For you.

                         JANE
               No, no, no.... What do you mean???
               Jake, this is crazy!
                   (worried the kids will
                    hear, whispers)
               Are you telling me the truth?

                          JAKE
                   (nods)
               This feels so right Jane.

     As Jane is about to respond, Gabby EXITS the house in her          
     PJ's, looking confused.

                         GABBY                                          
                   (from the porch)
               What's going on?

                         JANE
               Nothing. Honey, set the table,
               I'll be right in.
                                                            99.



                       GABBY                                      
             Mom, you're the only one who cares
             if the table's set.

                        JANE
             Okay, then do it for me....just go
             in please.

Luke and Lauren join Gabby on the porch.                          
                       LUKE
             What's up, Dad?

                       JAKE
             Having some problems on the home
             front, just wanted to talk to your
             Mom for a sec.

Jane shakes her head.    Why did he have to say that?   Harley
joins the Kids.                                                   
                       LAUREN
             Problems on the home front?   Is one
             of you seeing someone else?

Hearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right       
back inside. Jane's eyes widen toward Jake.

                       JAKE
                 (off Jane's cue)
             No, it's nothing like that. I just
             need to find a hotel or something
             for a few days `til I get my head
             together.

                       GABBY                                      
             It's that serious?

Jake nods.

                       LUKE
             Mom, can Dad stay here for a few
             days? He can share my room.

                       JANE
             I don't think that's the best idea,
             Luke.

                       GABBY                                      
             Daddy, are you crying?
                                                              100.




93   ON JAKE - TEARS WELLING UP                                 93
     He turns away from the kids.   The tears could be for dramatic
     effect, could be real.

                            JAKE
               I'm sorry.

     All Three Kids immediately well up and look at Jane.

                         LUKE
                   (begging)
               Mom........


97   EXT. FRONT PORCH DINING AREA - A LITTLE LATER              97     
     Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits
     silently around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French
     Toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit. His mood has been
     lifted. His energy is in full bloom.

                         JAKE
               Mommy's the best cook in the world!


98   EXT. VEGETABLE GARDEN - LATER THAT DAY                     98
     Jane is working in the garden. A shadow falls over her.    She
     looks up, Jake stands before her, a cute smile breaking
     across his face.

                         JAKE
               Thank you for saving me Janey.

                         JANE
               Jake, you knew the kids were all
               here. Shouldn't we have talked
               about this? Agreed this was the
               right thing to do? This is so
               typical. Only thinking about works
               for you.

                         JAKE
               I'm sorry, I guess I should've
               called before showing up.

                         JANE
               -- And I'm not sure you even left
               Agness. Maybe she saw something
               last night and threw you out...
                                                         101.



                    JAKE
          What's the difference? I was
          drowning over there. I'm not going
          to get that many more chances in my
          life to figure myself out. Janey,
          let's use these couple of days to
          see if we can make this work.

                    JANE
          We can't, Jake. I told you this
          the other night. Please listen.

                     JAKE
          But you were all pissy because you
          thought I stood you up. Things are
          different now. I'm a free man.
              (then)
          Can we just hug? I hate that
          you're being so distant. It's
          literally giving me a pain in my
          stomach.

                       JANE
          Oh, God...

Jane reluctantly hugs him.      He tries to kiss her.

                      JANE
          See!    Too much!

                      JAKE
          Okay!    Good note.

Jane can't help but smile.

                    JAKE
          Can I help with what you're doing?
          Hold your basket or...

                    JANE
          I'm fine....

                    JAKE
          Okay... I'm going to go to the
          video store and get us all a dvd to
          watch tonight. We'll have movie
          night. Just like old times. How's
          that? I'll make the popcorn.                          
Just then Jane's Cell RINGS.
                                                                 102.



                          JANE
                Fine.
                    (into phone)
                Hello...

                          JAKE
                    (whispers)
                I love knowing I'm coming back
                here.

                           JANE
                     (nods, turning slightly)
                Oh, hi... I slept great. How `bout
                you?

      Jake waits, but realizes Jane's not going to turn back.


99    INT. FAMILY ROOM - JANE'S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT                 99
      The Adlers are watching The Graduate. The lights are low.
      Jake, shoes off, hands everyone bowls of popcorn. Jane sits
      in a club chair. Harley's on the floor and the Adler Kids
      are on one long sofa, all covered in a blanket. Jake hands
      them popcorn then squeezes back in, between the Girls.


      ON THE FLAT SCREEN - BUCK HENRY AND DUSTIN HOFFMAN

                          BUCK HENERY
                Are you here for an affair, sir?

                          DUSTIN
                What?

                          BUCK HENRY
                The Singleman party, sir?

      Jane cringes as the Kids laugh. She looks over at Jake
      snuggling between the Kids, all eating popcorn and laughing.
      He catches Jane's eye and mouths.

                          JAKE
                I'M SO HAPPY!!!


100   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT - EST.                 100
                                                              103.




101   INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME                                   101
      Jake, bare legged and wearing a robe and slippers, crosses to
      the KITCHEN where he finds Luke and Gabby digging through the    
      fridge.

                          JAKE
                Any leftovers?

                          GABBY                                        
                Are you kidding?
                    (takes out an armful of
                     Tupperware)

                          JAKE
                Any of that noodle thing left?
                    (Gabby hands it to him.)                           
                Where's Mom? She disappeared so
                fast after the movie.

                          GABBY                                        
                She's probably sleeping.

                          LUKE
                I think she's on her computer.

      They all nibble out of Tupperware, leaning against various
      counters.

                          LUKE
                Tonight was weird.

                          GABBY                                        
                So weird. Still is.

                          JAKE
                I loved tonight.

                          GABBY                                        
                Yeah. That's why it was so weird.
                Just seeing you in your robe in our
                kitchen. Remember when you weren't
                even allowed in. Mom used to go out
                to the car to talk to you...

                          LUKE
                    (handing Gabby his                                 
                     Tupperware)
                You know, I don't even really
                remember you and Mom as a couple.
                                                         104.



                    JAKE
          What do you mean... you were ten
          when we broke up.

                    LUKE
          I was eight actually and I don't
          know...it's all foggy to me now.

                    JAKE
          You don't remember us in Hawaii or
          all sleeping in that tent in the
          backyard.

                    LUKE
          Yeah, of course, but I don't
          remember like you and Mom hugging
          or waking up together...

Jake grabs his heart, moans.

                     LUKE
          -- It's okay. I'm not damaged or
          anything. You've been good
          parents...

                    GABBY                                       
          Speak for yourself dude. I'm
          definitely damaged from the
          divorce.

Harley and Lauren ENTER.   Lauren turns the tea kettle on.

                    LAUREN
          Hello troops.

                    JAKE
          Why are you still here?

                    LAUREN
          I don't know, you and Mom sleeping
          in the same house. Harley thought
          we should stay.

Jake turns his beams on Harley.

                    HARLEY
          She exaggerates. I just thought
          perhaps you might want to talk
          later, or ... Is that the noodle
          thing?

                    JAKE
          Oh. Sorry. I think I ate it all.
                                                               105.



                          GABBY                                          
                Dad!

                          JAKE
                I didn't know anyone wanted any.


102   INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER                        102
      Jane, sits on her bed, talking to Adam via iSight. On her
      LAPTOP SCREEN, we see Adam but he's a bit of a BLUR.

                          JANE
                Wait, I can't see that one.    Can
                you back up a little?

      CLOSE ON JANE'S LAP TOP SCREEN - ADAM IN HIS BEDROOM

      He back ups from the lens and models a rather ridiculous ski
      sweater.

                           JANE
                    (hmmm)
                Very festive...

                          ADAM
                O-kay. Thank you.
                    (into lens)
                Gift from my ex-sister-in-law.
                Have no idea why I kept it.
                    (pulls sweater off)
                Into the pile. Hey, check out the
                pile, Jane.

      Adam POINTS HIS LAPTOP to the floor to show a HUGE STACK OF
      OLD CLOTHES.

                           JANE
                Nice!
                    (then)
                Hey, the pile's moving....

                          ADAM
                Murphy, get out of there!

      A small Mutt scurries out of the pile.   Jane laughs.              
                          ADAM
                    (re-enters in an odd
                     shirt)
                What about this?   I was in India
                and I had it made.
                          (MORE)
                                                        106.
                    ADAM(cont'd)
          The guy ran out of fabric so he
          didn't make me long sleeves.
              (looks down)
          Or short sleeves. It's weird.

                    JANE
          And kinda girly.

                    ADAM
              (taking it off)
          Not what I'm going for.
              (holds up a sweater)                             
          Gray sweater. Very old.                              
                       JANE
          But cute.

                    ADAM
              (slips it on)
          You sure? You don't have to say you
          like it just because you nixed the
          last 20 things.

Jane likes this man.

                    JANE
          Keep it. It's cozy.   Boy, you have
          a lot of clothes.

                    ADAM
              (looks at the floor)
          Uh, not anymore. Okay, we're
          almost done. You are helping me so
          much by the way.

                    JANE
          -- Adam, I really have to pee.

                     ADAM
          Oh good. Me too. Meet you back in
          thirty....
              (lifting the laptop)
          Putting this on my desk....

ON JANE'S SIDE

Just a shot of Jane's Pillows on her bed.

                    JANE'S VOICE
          I'm not in there...

ON ADAM'S SIDE - AN ISIGHT FRAME OF AN EMPTY DESK CHAIR.
                                                                  107.



                           ADAM'S VOICE
                 Can't hear you.


103    INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - WIDE - SAME TIME                      103
       Jake pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the
       room. He hears Jane in the bathroom and ENTERS quietly,
       quickly squirms out of his boxers and T-shirt, then, DROPS      
       HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed, completely NUDE --
       elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face. He
       changes his smile to a smoulder.

       Jake hears water running. Suddenly modest, he quickly drags
       over the open Laptop and places the open screen in front of
       his privates. He smiles, ready to be discovered.


       JANE                                                               

A104   dries her hands at the bathroom sink.                      A104    


104    INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME                             104
       Adam crosses through the room on his way to his laptop.

105    JANE ENTERS HER BEDROOM, SEES JAKE and lets out a SCREAM. 105

       Simultaneously, ADAM PLOPS DOWN IN HIS DESK CHAIR, LOOKS AT
       HIS SCREEN and instantly YANKS HIMSELF AWAY in disgust.

                           ADAM
                 Mother of --
                     (looks again)
                 Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

       Jake LOOKS DOWN AT THE SCREEN,    SEES ADAM'S SCREAMING FACE
       AND SCREAMS BACK.

                           JANE
                 What are you doing in here?!!!

                           ADAM
                     (covering the screen with
                      his hands)
                 Get it off!!!

                           JAKE
                     (covering himself)
                 I wanted to see you.
                                                        108.



                    JANE
          Why are you naked!?!

                    JAKE
              (sits up straight, the lap
               top shooting even more
               directly at his groin)
          Why do you think?

                    ADAM
          Okay, I'm gonna be sick.

Jake LEANS IN, covers Adam's eyes on the screen, which, of
course, does nothing.

                    ADAM
          Not working! Big close up!

Jake rises, now his ass gets the close up, he bends over to
get his robe.

                     ADAM
          Okay!   Good night!

Jake SPINS THE LAPTOP and the ISIGHT LENS LANDS ON JANE.
Jane and Adam look at one another. No time to say anything.
She's desperate. He's lost.

The DOOR FLIES OPEN, the KIDS RUSH IN, just as Jake ties his
robe.

                    GABBY                                       
          Everybody okay?

No one says anything.

                    LAUREN
          What's happening?

Adam listens, his eyes on Jane. Jake crosses to Jane, facing
the Kids. He walks in and out of the iSight shot.

                    JAKE
          Okay. Let me explain. The reason I
          left Agness wasn't just because my
          marriage wasn't working.
              (The Kids wait...)
          I've also fallen in love...back in
          love... with your mother. Or maybe
          I never stopped loving her.

                    GABBY                                       
          Is this a joke?                                       
                                                                109.



                          JAKE
                I know this is shocking, but I
                think this is the best thing that's
                ever happened to me. Your Mom and
                I have been seeing each other, on
                the side... ever since New York.

                          LAUREN                                        
                Mom, is this true?

                          JANE
                    (dying)
                That part is, but..

                          JAKE
                I found my way back home.     I just
                hope she'll take me back.

      Gabby breaks down in tears.    Lauren puts her arm around her.    
      Jane starts to cry, looks at her laptop, just as she HEARS A
      CLICK and THE LAPTOP SCREEN GOES BLACK.

                          JAKE
                Why's everyone crying?     Why isn't
                this good news?

                          LAUREN                                        
                Because we're still getting over                        
                the divorce.                                            
                          LUKE
                Mom, are you and Dad getting back
                together?

                          JANE
                No... we're not.

      Jane looks at the Kids with incredible sadness.


106   EXT. DRIVEWAY - LATER - THAT NIGHT                         106
      The Kids, in their cars, drive down the road, away from the
      house. Jane stands in the driveway, watching, never before
      feeling quite like this. Jake EXITS THE HOUSE, holding his
      bag. He stops, looks at Jane. She has nothing left to say.
      Jake gets in his car and pulls away as Jane walks back
      inside.

108   EXT. POOL AREA/BACKYARD - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT               108
      Jane lies on a pool chaise, wrapped in a blanket, tissues in
      hand. She stares up at the night sky and as her eyes flutter
      shut, we drift off of her...                                       
                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

123   EXT. JANE'S POOL/BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING                   123
      CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS THE POOL TO JANE, asleep on the pool          
      chaise, still wrapped in a blanket. The sprinklers go off          
      and wake Jane. She opens her eyes, looks around, realizes          
      she's spent the night outside.

      Jane sits up too fast, a tad disoriented, then quickly             
      realizes what she must do.                                         


124   A FRONT DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL HARLEY                         124
      bed-headed and still in his pj's. He approvingly looks at
      Jane, who stands across from him, ready to right it all.

                          HARLEY
                Glad you're here, boss.


125   INT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS                                   125
      Harley leads Jane down the narrow hall to the Bedroom.

                          HARLEY

                Jane, but...                                             
                          JANE

                I know you do.                                           
      Jane pauses, Harley nods for her to go inside.                     

      JANE'S POV - INSIDE THE BEDROOM

      Her Three Kids are under the covers. Lauren is between Gabby       
      and Luke. They look like they just woke up.
                                                      111.


Jane stands in the doorway. The Kids don't say a word. Jane
doesn't wait. She crosses to the bed, sits on it, looks at
her children.

                    JANE
          Knowing how to be divorced is next
          to impossible... and sometimes over
          the years, I've thought that your
          Dad and I weren't quite finished.
          And, as it turns out, we weren't.
          So I went out of my comfort zone,
          which, I found out, if you're
          really honest with yourself, isn't
          all that comforting. So, I
          experimented with a part of myself.
          I wanted to find out if, after all
          these years there was still
          something there between us.

                    LAUREN
          And was there?

                    JANE
          There kinda was.

Lauren smiles with her eyes.

                    GABBY                                      
          But Mom, you have to understand how
          bonkers this sounds to us. For two
          people who for years couldn't be in
          the same room together...to then
          have an affair??? You and Dad...!

                    JANE
          I know...it was hard for me and I
          was doing it. I hope you'll
          forgive me for confusing you or
          betraying your trust, but I did
          this for me and for him and I
          realized even though your Dad and I
          once had something extraordinary...
          we no longer really fit together.
          But he is a part of me and always
          will be.

                    LUKE
          So it's over now? You guys are
          back to being divorced.

                    JANE
          For better or for worse.
                                                                112.



      Lauren takes her Mom's hand. Harley joins them, sitting on
      the other side of the bed, holding back tears.

                             HARLEY

126   A MOVING POV - INT. ARCHITECTURE OFFICE - DAY              126
      REVERSE ON JANE walking through Adam's firm.    She arrives at:

127   ADAM'S OFFICE                                              127
      Adam is on a phone call.

                           ADAM
                    (into phone)
                Yeah no problem...we can definitely
                do that...
                    (notices Jane)
                -- James, can I call you back,
                someone just... Thanks.
                    (rises)
                Hi.

                          JANE
                Hi. May I come in?

                             ADAM
                -- Sure.

                          JANE
                I didn't call you last night                             
                because I wasn't sure you would
                take the call and then I thought
                that could go on for months and...                       
                          ADAM
                -- I would have taken the call.

                          JANE
                Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to
                say these things in person. Adam,
                the man I was seeing was...

                          ADAM
                I think I'm up to speed on that
                part.
                                                  113.



                    JANE
          I want you to know it didn't last
          long and you're divorced, so maybe
          you understand, when marriages end,
          there's doubts and hurt, and you've
          got kids and sometimes you wonder
          if you did the right thing and when
          the moment presented itself...

                    ADAM
          -- I get it. I could imagine it...I
          could...

                    JANE
          I told him it wasn't going to work
          between us but I guess he didn't
          believe me and unbeknownst to me,
          he showed up at my house yesterday.
          He left Agness and...

                    ADAM
          -- Jane. I actually think I
          understand what happened
          but...uh...you know I'm not as
          macho as I appear and I think it's
          probably best for us not to get any
          more... involved because your
          relationship with Jake isn't really
          done and I know you're saying it
          is, but he's in love with you and
          for everyone's sake, that should
          probably get resolved.

                     JANE
          Wow.   So that's how grown ups talk.

Adam smiles.

                    JANE
          Please tell me you're not going to
          quit my job and ask Peter to take
          over because then I'll never get to
          see you and...

                    ADAM
          I was thinking of asking Peter to
          step back in.

                    JANE
          Oh... I hope you don't...

                     ADAM
          Thanks.
                                                             114.

129   EXT. ROAD TO JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY                    129
      Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her
      driveway. She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the
      bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard.

      Jane crosses to Jake. He moves over. Jane sees the humor in
      this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a
      sigh. Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.

                             JAKE
                I'm sorry.

      Jane doesn't answer right away.

                          JANE
                How far back does that sorry go?

                          JAKE
                How far back do you need it to go?

                             JANE
                Way back.

                          JAKE
                Consider it an all inclusive
                apology. From not being the
                husband you needed to showing up
                nude on your bed last night.

                           JANE
                Yeah, what were you thinking with
                that move?

                          JAKE
                That you'd find me irresistible.

      Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.

                          JAKE
                Never considered the alternative.

                          JANE
                Gotta love that about you.

      They swing some more.
                                        115.



          JAKE
Oh, man, can't believe I got up to
bat again and blew it.

          JANE
You didn't blow it. We blew it.
We blew it the first time around.
This time... we just should've
known better. Too much has
happened. Too much time has passed.

          JAKE
And you don't think we could make
it right?                                      
          JANE
Does that mean you didn't feel it
was totally right either?                      
          JAKE
Being with you Jane is the best I'm
gonna be.

           JANE
But do you agree that it wasn't
really...?                                     
          JAKE
It was complicated.

          JANE
Begging for an answer.

          JAKE
I thought it was good.   I wanted it
to be good.

          JANE
Guess that's as close as I'm gonna             
get.

          JAKE
Do you always have to be so hard on
me?

           JANE
No.   I don't.

          JAKE
I don't regret giving it another
shot.
                                                               116.



                          JANE
                Probably would've been better if
                you hadn't been married.

                          JAKE
                It may never have happened if I
                wasn't married.

      Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side       
      by side, as they sway in the breeze.                               
                          JANE
                I don't regret it either.

      They continue rocking, not much more to say.   As CAMERA PULLS     
      AWAY, we:

130   EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - MANY MORNINGS LATER                     130
      It's raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber
      is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps.

      Jane EXITS THE HOUSE in a parka and under an umbrella. A
      GROUP OF CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE huddled under a make-shift          
      tarp. Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to           
      face her she spots Adam, holding blue prints. Jane is              
      stunned he's there.                                                
                          ADAM
                Good morning.

                          JANE
                Good morning.

                          ADAM
                Did you know it's good luck to
                start building in the rain?

                          JANE
                Really?

                          ADAM
                    (obviously lying)
                Yes. It's a well known, very good,
                really lucky omen.

      Thunder rattles the sky.
                                                          117.



                     JANE
              (looking up)
          Good, I could use one.
              (then)
          Would you all like to have your
          meeting in the house...it's dry and
          I've got hot coffee...

The Group thanks her and heads for the house. Adam stays
back and walks next to Jane. It's a long second before
someone talks.

                    ADAM                                         
          Jane, I need to ask you                                
          something...                                           
                    JANE                                         
          Anything...                                            
                     ADAM                                        
          You wouldn't happen to have any of                     
          those amazing chocolate croissants,
          would you?

                    JANE                                         
          Oh.... you like those, huh?                            
                    ADAM                                         
          I have incredibly fond memories of                     
          them.                                                  
                    JANE                                         
          I don't have any here, but we could                    
          go into town and get some... right                     
          out of the oven.                                       
They turn toward the house and on their backs we hear:           
                    ADAM                                         
          You want to do that?                                   
                    JANE                                         
          Yeah... love to.                                       
And as they walk away from Camera, we: 
                          
                                          SLOWLY FADE OUT
JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK

                                                         OVER BLACK WE SEE:

               CHYRON

               A long time ago, in front of a convenience store far, far 
               away--

               EXT. QUICK STOP YEARS AGO--DAY

               We FADE IN on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from 
               sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK -- 
               a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A 
               white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap 
               comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an 
               oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, 
               and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in 
               the Mother's hands.

                                     MOTHER
                         Bobby-Boy stay here while mommy picks 
                         up the free cheese, 'kay?

               She looks up at the bright sun, shielding her eyes slightly, 
               then looks back at the baby on the ground. She takes off her 
               baseball cap and places it on the baby.

                                     MOTHER
                         This'll keep the sun out of your 
                         eyes. You be good now.

               She walks away, leaving the baby sitting against the wall. 
               With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his 
               mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks 
               kind of familiar.

               Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS 
               concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair 
               enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip. 
               She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets 
               her Baby down beside him.

                                     MOTHER
                         Don't fucking move, you little shit-
                         machine. Mommy's gonna try to score.

               A PASSERBY enters, heading toward the convenience store. He 
               takes note of the Babies and the Mother heading into the 
               record store, and then stops and addresses her, disgusted.

                                     PASSERBY
                         Excuse me--who's watching these 
                         babies?

                                     MOTHER
                         The fat one's watching the little 
                         one.

                                     PASSERBY
                         Oh, nice parenting.
                              (walking away)
                         Leave'em out here like that and see 
                         what happens.

               The Passerby walks away. The Mother flips him the bird.

                                     MOTHER
                         FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SQUARE!

                                     PASSERBY
                              (waving her off)
                         Ah, keep on truckin'.

                                     MOTHER
                              (to baby)
                         D'jou hear the crazy fuck tellin' me 
                         how to fuckin' raise you? 
                         Motherfucker, man! Who's he fucking 
                         think he is? What's the worse fuckin' 
                         thing could happen to you sitting 
                         outside the fuckin' stores? Fuck!

               The door closes, and the Babies sit there quietly for a beat. 
               Then, they look at each other. The larger one says nothing. 
               The smaller one says--

                                     BABY
                         Fuck, fuck, fuck...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE PRESENT

               JAY and SILENT BOB stand where the Babies sat. The Record 
               Rack is now RST VIDEO.

               Jay is mid-chant.

                                     JAY
                              (as a chant)
                         --fuck, fuck, fuck, mother-mother 
                         fuck, mother-mother fuck-fuck! Mother-
                         fuck-, mother-fuck, mother-fuck, 
                         noinch, noinch, noinch, smoking weed, 
                         smoking weed, doing coke, drinking 
                         beers!  Drinking beers, beers, beers, 
                         rolling fatties, smoking blunts! Who 
                         smokes the blunts? We smoke the 
                         blunts!

               A pair of TEENS approach them.

                                     TEEN 1
                         Lemme get a nickel bag.

                                     JAY
                         Fifteen bucks, little man. Put the 
                         money in my hand. If the money does 
                         not show, then you owe-me-owe-me-
                         owe.
                              (changing up to Morris 
                              Day)
                         My Jungle Love! Yes, Oh-we-oh-we-oh! 
                         I think I want to know ya', know ya'--

                                     TEEN 1
                              (digging in pockets)
                         What the hell are you singing?

                                     JAY
                         You don't know "Jungle Love"? That 
                         shit is the mad notes. Written by 
                         God Herself and handed down to the 
                         world's greatest band--the 
                         motherfucking Time.

                         The guys in that Prince movie?

                         Purple Rain.

                                     TEEN 2
                         Man, that shit was so gay--fucking 
                         eighties style.

               Jay suddenly grabs the kid by the throat, throwing him against 
               the wall.

                                     JAY
                         Bitch, don't you NEVER say an unkind 
                         word about The Time! Me and Silent 
                         Bob modeled our whole fucking lives 
                         after Morris Day and Jerome! I'm a 
                         smooth pimp who loves the pussy, and 
                         Tubby here's my black manservant!

               Just then, RANDAL exits the video store, locking the door 
               behind him.

                                     RANDAL
                         What'd I tell you two about dealing 
                         in front of the store? Drop the kid 
                         and peddle your wares someplace else, 
                         burn-boy.
                              (walking away)
                         And for the record, The Time sucked 
                         ass.

               He exits. Jay, Silent Bob, and the Teens watch him go. After 
               a beat--

                                     JAY
                         Yo-youse guys wanna hear something 
                         fucked up about him and the Quick 
                         Stop guy?

               INT. QUICK STOP-DAY

               Randal joins Dante behind the counter. Dante rings up a 
               customer, a half-eaten submarine sandwich sitting on the 
               counter. Randal grabs it, takes a bite, and starts reading a 
               newspaper.

                                     RANDAL
                         Hey, can't we do something about 
                         those two stoners hanging around 
                         outside all the time?

                                     DANTE
                         Why? What'd they do now?

                                     RANDAL
                         I'm trying to watch Clash of the 
                         Titans, and all I can hear is the 
                         two them screaming about Morris Day 
                         at the top of their lungs.

                                     DANTE
                         I thought the fat one didn't really 
                         talk much.

                                     RANDAL
                         What, am I producing an A&E Biography 
                         about 'em? I'm just saying they 
                         shouldn't be loitering around the 
                         stores like they do.

                                     DANTE
                         Neither should you, but we let you 
                         stay.

                                     RANDAL
                         See, man--if you were funnier than 
                         that, ABC never would've canceled 
                         us.

                                     DANTE
                         What?

                                     RANDAL
                         Nothing.

               Enter Teen 1 and Teen 2, chuckling.

                                     TEEN 1
                         Two packs of Wraps.

                         Yo--how was the service?

                                     RANDAL
                         What service?

                                     TEEN 2
                         The one at the Unitarian church where 
                         you two got married to each other 
                         last week.

                                     RANDAL
                         What the hell are you talking about?

                                     TEEN 1
                         Jay said you had a Star-Wars--themed 
                         wedding and you guys tied the knot 
                         dressed like storm troopers.

                                     TEEN 2
                         Yeah. And he said you're the bitch

                         about those two. I shoulda done a

                              (into phone)
                         Yeah, I want to report a couple of 
                         drug dealers out in front of the 
                         Quick Stop.

               EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY

               Jay and Silent Bob are thrown against the wall outside by a 
               COP, who frisks them.

                                     JAY
                         What the Fuck, Serpico? What'd we 
                         do?

                                     COP
                         We got a report that two guys were 
                         hanging around outside the stores, 
                         selling pot?

                                     JAY
                         We don't smoke pot, yo.

               Teen 1 enters and hands Jay rolling papers.

                                     TEEN 1
                         Here're the rolling papers you wanted 
                         for your pot. And your change. Thanks.
                              (getting in Jay's 
                              face)
                         And The Time sucks ass!

               Teen 1 races off. Jay and Bob move to follow, but the Cop 
               stops them, grabbing the rolling papers out of Jay's hand. 
               He eyeballs the pair.

                                     COP
                         No pot, hunh? What do you need this 
                         for?

                                     JAY
                         What?  I got a wiping problem. I 
                         stick these little pieces of paper 
                         over my brown-eye, and bam--no shit 
                         stains in my undies.
                              (unbuttoning pants)
                         You don't believe me? Lemme show 
                         you.

               Jay drops his pants and leans against the wall, looking back 
               over his shoulder.

                                     JAY
                         Just spread my cheeks a little and 
                         you can see the fucking stink nuggets--

                                     COP
                         Pull up your pants up sir, Now!

               Jay bends down to pull up his pants and FARTS. Silent Bob 
               cracks up. The Cop grabs them both, leading them toward the 
               car.

                                     COP
                         Let's take a ride down to the station.

                                     JAY
                         What? It's suddenly a crime to fart, 
                         motherfucker?!

               EXT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--DAY

               An ESTABLISHING SHOT of Brodie's store in the heart of Red 
               Bank.

                                     BRODIE (O.S.)
                         No fucking way!

               WE GO TIGHT on the huge, cartoon sign of BRODIE outside to--

               INT. BRODIE BRUCE'S SECRET STASH COMIC BOOK STORE--LATER

               BRODIE himself, holding a stack of comics in one hand and a 
               Dixie cup in the other, Jay and Silent Bob follow him as he 
               puts new books in the racks.

                                     BRODIE
                         Dante and Randal slapped you with a 
                         restraining order?!

                                     JAY
                         Judge said if we go within a hundred 
                         feet of the stores, we get thrown 
                         into County.

                                     BRODIE
                         So you gonna abide by the court's 
                         ruling or you gonna go Bandit--
                         Reynolds style?

                                     JAY
                         Fuck yeah! You know what they make 
                         you do in county? Toss the fucking 
                         salad! I don't like this fuck's 
                         asshole; I'm gonna do it for some 
                         stranger?

                                     BRODIE
                         I guess if you really wanted to hang 
                         out in from of a convenience store, 
                         you could just buy your own now--
                         what with all that money you guys 
                         made.

                                     JAY
                         Hell yeah, bitch.
                              (beat)
                         Wait a second--what money?

                                     BRODIE
                         The money from the movie, dumb-ass.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are you babbling about?

                                     BRODIE
                              (pulling a bagged-and-
                              boarded issue down 
                              from the wall)
                         The Bluntman and Chronic movie.
                              (dawns on him)
                         Oh my God--don't tell me you have no 
                         idea there's a movie being made of 
                         the comic you two were the basis 
                         for.

                                     JAY
                         What?! Since when?

                                     BRODIE
                         Goddamit, man--
                              (taps his wrist)
                         Here's the pulse, alright. And here's 
                         your finger--
                              (shoves his hand down 
                              the back of his pants)
                         --far from the pulse, jammed straight 
                         up your ass.
                              (extracts hand and 
                              extends it to Jay)
                         Say--would you like a chocolate 
                         covered pretzel?

               Brodie leads them back to the counter.

                                     BRODIE
                         You see, kids, if you read Wizard, 
                         you'd know it's the top story this 
                         month.  Check it out.

               Brodie hands Jay and Silent Bob a copy of Wizard, opened to 
               the headline: Snootchie Bootchies! Bluntman and Chronic Get 
               Big Screen Treatment!  There are pictures of HOLDEN MCNEIL 
               AND BANKY EDWARDS, as well as drawings of Bluntman and 
               Chronic.

                                     JAY
                         When the fuck did this happen?!

                                     BRODIE
                         Well, after X-Men hit at the box 
                         office, all the studios started buying 
                         up every comic property they could 
                         get their hands on. Miramax optioned 
                         Bluntman and Chronic.

                                     JAY
                         Miramax? I thought they only made 
                         classy flicks like The Piano and The 
                         Crying Game?

                                     BRODIE
                         Yeah, well once they made She's All 
                         That, everything went to hell. So 
                         you're saying you haven't gotten a 
                         cut of the movie? Didn't Holden McNeil 
                         and Banky Edwards used to pay you 
                         likeness rights for the comic book?

                                     JAY
                         We haven't seen a fucking dime for 
                         no movie!

                                     BRODIE
                         Well boys, I'm no lawyer, but I think 
                         Holden and Banky owe you some of the 
                         proverbial phat cash. I mean they're 
                         making a movie based on characters 
                         that are based on you and Quiet 
                         Robert.

                                     JAY
                         It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a 
                         pair of stupid-ass superheroes that 
                         run around saying "Snitchy-Nitchies" 
                         or something.

                                     BRODIE
                         I believe it "Snootchie Boochies."  
                         Regardless--you're getting screwed. 
                         If I was you guys, I'd confront Holden 
                         McNeil and ask him for my movie check.

                                     JAY
                         Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid.

                                     BRODIE
                         And on that note, we cue the music.

               Jay lays down a House bass beat. Brodie complements it with 
               his own beat.

               EXT. POTZER'S INC--DAY

               Jay and Silent Bob mosey past the front door of the building 
               and knock.

               INT. POTZER'S INC--DAY

               Holden McNeil, opens the door and smiles.

                                     HOLDEN
                         Well! I have been waiting years to 
                         do this.
                              (smiles)
                         Look at these morose motherfuckers 
                         right here. Smells like someone shit 
                         in their cereal. Bunngg!

               Jay and Silent Bob enter. Holden closes the door, following 
               them.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck took you so long 
                         answering your damn door? You trying 
                         to talk another girlfriend of yours 
                         into some of that gay-ass three-way 
                         action with your buddy?

                                     HOLDEN
                         No, I was just showering your mother's 
                         stink off me after I gave her a quick 
                         jump and sent her home. But now that 
                         you mention it--
                              (to Bob)
                         Thanks, you know. You could've made 
                         the moral of that story you told me 
                         a bit more clear.

               Silent Bob shrugs.

                                     HOLDEN
                         So what brings you two dirt merchants 
                         to my neck of the woods?

                                     JAY

                         not alone in the opinion that this 
                         flick is the worst idea since Greedo 
                         shooting first. I mean, a Jay and 
                         Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to 
                         see that?

               Holden, Jay and Silent Bob pause and look at the camera for 
               a beat. Then--

                                     HOLDEN
                         But since it is happening, you might 
                         as well just ignore the idiots on 
                         the Internet, go find Banky, and get 
                         your "motherfucking movie check." As 
                         you so succinctly put it. That's 
                         what's important here.

                                     JAY
                         No, Holden McNeil--what's important 
                         here is that there's a bunch of 
                         motherfuckers we don't even know 
                         calling us assholes on the Internet 
                         to a bunch of teenagers and guys who 
                         can't even get laid. Putting a stop 
                         to that is the most important thing 
                         we could ever do.
                              (off monitor)
                         When did it say they're making that 
                         movie?

                                     HOLDEN
                         They start this Friday.

                                     JAY
                         So if today's Tuesday, that gives us--
                              (counts)
                         Eight days.

                                     HOLDEN
                         It's more like three days.

                                     JAY
                         Right. Three days to stop that stupid 
                         fucking movie from getting made! 
                         C'mon, Silent Bob--

               Jay and Bob stand and look at each other, filled with purpose.

                                     JAY
                         We're going to Hollywood.

               They stride off. Holden shakes his head.

                                     HOLDEN
                         Now that's what I call the Blunt 
                         leading the Blunt.

               EXT. BUS STATION--DAY

               Jay and Silent Bob approach a bus that's labeled "Los 
               Angeles." They nod at each other and then climb aboard. After 
               a beat, they re-emerge.

                                     JAY
                         Tickets? Since when did they start 
                         charging for the bus?

               They head toward the depot.

                                     JAY
                         Didn't we used to ride that shit to 
                         school every day for free?

               EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

               The bus roars past a sign that read: Leaving New Jersey.

               INT. BUS--SAME

               Jay makes his way up to the DRIVER.

                                     JAY
                         We in Hollywood yet?

                                     DRIVER
                         It's a three--day ride to Los Angeles, 
                         sir. We left twenty minutes ago.

                                     JAY
                         I didn't ask you about Los Angeles. 
                         I asked you about Hollywood.

                                     DRIVER
                         Hollywood's in Los Angeles, sir.

                                     JAY
                         Don't change the subject! Are we in 
                         Hollywood yet or not?

                                     DRIVER
                         Please sit down, sir.

               Jay glares at the Driver and heads back to his seat.

                                     JAY
                         Why don't you take your seat Ralph 
                         Kramden--

               Jay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't 
                         shit to so on this bus.

               Silent Bob mimes jerking off.

                                     JAY
                         I already did that. Twice.

               Silent Bob shrugs, looking out the window, Jay looks across 
               the aisle and spots a CHILD IN A HELMET playing a handheld 
               video game. He leans over to him.

                                     JAY
                         Yo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn.

                                     CHILD
                         Leave me alone, little kid.

               The Child gives him the finger. Jay goes wide-eyed, turning 
               to Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         That fuck called me a little kid and 
                         gave me the finger! Go kick his ass!

               Silent Bob offers an incredulous look, as if to say, "He's 
               ten years old."

                                     JAY
                         You're my muscle, ain'tcha?

               Silent Bob kind of nods.

                                     JAY
                         So go open a can of whup-ass on that 
                         little fuck, and get me his game!

               Silent Bob sighs and stands. He climbs over Jay into the 
               aisle and stands in front of the child. He looks at him and 
               registers doubt. He looks back to Jay, who waves him on. 

               Silent Bob steels himself, looks back to the kid and reaches 
               for his game. The Child emits a high-pitched scream and starts 
               punching himself in the head. Silent Bob dives back into his 
               seat, trying to look nonchalant. The Child stops crying. Jay 
               looks at Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         You're one tough motherfucker, you 
                         know that?

               EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

               The bus pulls over by the side of the road.

               INT. BUS--DAY

               The Bus Driver heads down the aisle toward the back of the 
               bus, followed by pissed-off PASSENGERS.

                                     PASSENGER
                         They been in there going on half an 
                         hour now! Two of them! Doing God 
                         knows what!

               The Bus Driver bangs on the bathroom door and shouts.

                                     DRIVER
                         This bus isn't moving another inch 
                         unless you clear out of there right 
                         now!

               No answer. The Bus Driver bangs on the door harder.

                                     DRIVER
                         DO YOU HEAR ME?! OPEN THIS DOOR! 
                         NOW!!

               The door handle turns, the door swings wide, and massive 
               amounts of smoke suddenly billow through the back of the 
               bus. The smoke clears to reveal Jay and Silent Bob squeezed 
               into the bathroom, holding a massive joint.

                                     JAY
                         Um--I think something's burning back 
                         here.

               EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER

               As the bus pulls away, Jay and Silent Bob are revealed, left 
               behind.

                                     JAY
                         The whole fucking world's against 
                         us, dude. I swear to God.

               Silent Bob nods. Jay sticks out his thumb and starts hitching.

               EXT. ROADSIDE--LATER

               Jay and Bob are walking backwards, hitching still.

                                     JAY
                         This sucks balls, man. How come we 
                         ain't getting no rides?

                                     VOICE
                         'Cause you're doing it all wrong.

               Jay and Bob look behind them. There's a GUY hitching as well.

                                     GUY
                         You gotta induce the drivers a little.

                                     JAY
                         Like how?

                                     GUY
                         Like this.

               The GUY holds out his sign to them. It reads: Will Give Head 
               For Ride.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah, but what happens when you get 
                         in the car, and you don't make with 
                         the head? Don't they kick your ass 
                         to the curb?

                                     GUY
                         Sure--if you don't make with the 
                         head.

               Jay and Bob look at him for a long beat. Then--

                                     JAY
                         Eww! You eat the cock?!?

                                     GUY
                         Yeah. If it'll get me a few hundred 
                         miles across country. I'll take a 
                         shot in the mouth.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah, but we ain't gay.

                                     GUY
                         Well, neither am I. But have you 
                         seen the price of bus tickets lately? 
                         Shit--I don't wanna cough up two 
                         hundred bucks just to get to Chicago.

                                     JAY
                         Well, I don't wanna cough up some 
                         dude's sperm!

                                     GUY
                         Don't be so suburban--this is the 
                         new millennium. Gay, straight--it's 
                         all the same now. There're no more 
                         lines.

               Jay draws a line on the ground with his foot.

                                     JAY
                         There's one. On this side of it, we 
                         ain't gay.

                                     GUY
                         All hitchers do this. Why do you 
                         think people pick us up? If you get 
                         a ride, it's expected--I don't care 
                         who the driver is. It's the first 
                         rule in the Book.

                                     JAY
                         What book?

                                     GUY
                         The unwritten Book of the Road.

               A TRUCK starts to pull over to the side of the road. The Guy 
               points to it, as if to say "See?" The passenger-side door 
               opens. The Guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. He 
               looks out the window at Jay and Bob.

                                     GUY
                         Follow the rules of the Book, and 
                         you'll get where you're going in no 
                         time.  Excuse me.

               Through the windshield, Jay and Silent Bob see the Guy go 
               face-first into the TRUCK DRIVER'S lap. The Truck Drivers 
               smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road.

               Jay and Silent Bob watch the truck disappear. Then, a CAR 
               pulls up. The NUN driving rolls down the passenger side window 
               and leans toward them.

                                     NUN
                         You two boys need a ride?

               INT. CAR--LATER

               The NUN drives, smiling. Jay and Silent Bob sit in the back 
               seat, huddled close together, their eyes glued on the Nun.

                                     NUN
                         You both don't have to sit back there. 
                         One of you can sit up here with me.

               Silent Bob shakes his head "no" to Jay. Jay shrugs and climbs 
               up front.

                                     NUN
                         So where are you boys from?

                                     JAY
                         New Jersey.

                                     NUN
                         What brings you to Indiana?

                                     JAY
                         We're going to Hollywood.

                                     NUN
                         Hollywood, hunh? That's a long ways 
                         away.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up.

                                     NUN
                         Well, do unto others. That's what 
                         the Book says.

                                     JAY
                              (misinterpreting 
                              completely)
                         Wait a minute--you follow the Book, 
                         too?

                                     NUN
                         I live my life by it.

                                     JAY
                         Really? You?

                                     NUN
                         Of course. You know how lonely it 
                         gets on the road? Thanks to the Book, 
                         I'm never alone--if you know what I 
                         mean.

                                     JAY
                         I guess. This guy back there explained 
                         it to us. But I didn't think you'd 
                         be into that.

                                     NUN
                         Are you kidding? I've dedicated my 
                         life to it. Every hour of every day.

                                     JAY
                         Shit--you nuns are alright.

                                     NUN
                         You live by the Book, too?

                                     JAY
                         You picked us up, didn't you? I gotta.

                                     NUN
                         That's good to hear. But it takes 
                         deed, not words. It's a lot easier 
                         to say you live by the Book than to 
                         actually do it.
                              (looks at him)
                         Can you do it?

                                     JAY
                         You want me to do it right now?

                                     NUN
                         No time like the present, right?

               Jay looks back at Silent Bob. Silent Bob shakes his head 
               "no." Jay shrugs them flips his hair over his shoulder, and 
               starts to bend down.

                                     JAY
                         Alright.
                              (he suddenly stops)
                         You hear that? She's not a Catholic. 
                         She's a Presbyterian.

               Jay disappears below the dash, The Nun goes wide-eyed.

               EXT. ROADSIDE--DAY

               The Nun's car screeched to the side of the road. Jay gets 
               kicked our of the front seat by the screaming Nun. Silent 
               Bob rushes out too, and the car races off. Jay's wipes his 
               mouth. He pulls a long curly hair from between his teeth.

                                     JAY
                         Dude--she had seventies bush.

               EXT. HIGHWAY--NIGHT

               Jay and Bob continue hitching.

                                     JAY
                         I can't believe this shit. Five hours 
                         and not a single ride. Every day, 
                         millions of people hitch to Hollywood 
                         and stop studios from making movies 
                         about 'em. But when you and me try 
                         it, it's like we're trapped in a 
                         fucking cartoon!

               A familiar-looking VAN pulls up in the other side of the 
               raid, The horn beeps.  Jay and Bob look at each other, shrug, 
               and race across the street, get in. The van pulls off.

               INT. VAN--NIGHT

               Jay and Bob sit in the back of the can and stare at--

               A clean-cut GUY, a Bookish woman in glasses, a red headed 
               Beauty, a stoner DUDE, and a GREAT DANE.

               Jay looks at Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         Zoinks, yo

                                     GUY
                         And now we can finally solve the 
                         mystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls! 
                         Pull off their masks and let's see 
                         who they really are!

                                     BOOKISH
                         I don't think they are masks.

                                     BEAUTY
                         I don't think they're Hitchhiking 
                         Girls either.

                                     BOOKISH
                         Ghouls, you fucking moron. Not Girls.
                              (to herself)
                         Though I wish they were hitchhiking 
                         girls. Sexy, skimpily clad hitchhiking
                         girls--

                                     GUY
                         Let's kick them out. We've got a 
                         mystery to solve.

                                     DUDE
                         The only mystery here is why we take 
                         our cues from a dick in a neckerchief!

                                     GUY
                         Keep it up, Beatnik! I'll feed you 
                         to the fucking dog!

                                     BEAUTY
                              (covering her ears; 
                              shrieking)
                         I CAN'T TAKE ALL THIS FIGHTING!

                                     JAY
                         YO!

               The Gang look to Jay and Bob.

                                     JAY
                         Youse guys need to turn those frowns 
                         upside down! And we got just the 
                         thing for that.
                              (pulls out a bag of 
                              joints)
                         We call them Doobie Snax.

               INT. VAN--WEED VISION

               As Jay and Bob toke up, we go all SLO-MO and 70's freaky 
               (with the image seeming to SWIM). Through their stoned haze, 
               we see old-school witches, skeletons, and ghouls swirling 
               about their heads--the latter of which gets his mask taken 
               off to reveal a man inside a costume.

               Jay and Bob look at the gang, then take a hit off their joint 
               and look back.  Suddenly, the gang's engaged in total 
               debauchery: the Dude rides the windshield while the Guy 
               cackles insanely, blindfolded by his neckerchief. Bookish 
               and Beauty are in their underwear, making out with each other. 
               The Great Dane looks at Jay and Bob and says--

                                     GREAT DANE
                         Ri, Ray rand Rirent Rob

               The Great Dane rolls over, revealing its RED THING sticking 
               way out of its sheath. It's monstrous. Jay and Bob go wide-
               eyed.

                                     JAY
                         Look at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's 
                         got a stoner-boner!!!

               Jay and Bob smile and pass out.

               We cut back to the gang, who now appear as they did prior to 
               Weed-Vision. They stare at the O.C. Jay and Bob.

                                     BEAUTY
                         I think they passed out.

                                     GUY
                         Great. What do we do with them now?

                                     DUDE
                         Let's cut out their kidneys to sell 
                         on the black market and leave them 
                         in a seedy motel bathtub full of 
                         ice.

                                     BOOKISH
                         Oh God, not again?

               INT. SEEDY MOTEL BATHROOM--NIGHT

               Jay lies in a bathtub full of ice, screaming. There's a scar 
               on his back.

               EXT. KANSAS CITY PARK--DAY

               Jay wakes up suddenly, screaming. He startles Bob awake as 
               well, as he clutched at this back lifting his shirt to see 
               the scar. It's not there.

                                     JAY
                         Holy shit, I had a horrible dream.
                              (looks around)
                         Yo, I'm hungry. Where can we get 
                         some breakfast?

               Bob looks around, and then locks on something O.C. He points, 
               and Jay looks, smiles widely, and nods.

               EXT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--DAY

               An ESTABLISHING SHOT of the fast food eatery, as Jay and Bob 
               enter.

               INT. MOOBY'S FAST FOOD JOINT--SAME

               As the pair head for the counter, Jay notices a public 
               INTERNET TERMINAL. He tugs at Silent Bob's arm.

                                     JAY
                         Yo--check that shit out: the Internet. 
                         Let's see if those fucks said 
                         something new about us and that stupid 
                         flick.

               Bob shrugs, heading for the terminal. He inserts a dollar 
               and types, following it up with a mouse click. The pair look 
               at the screen and go wide-eyed.

                                     JAY
                         "Any movie based on Jay and Silent 
                         Bob is gonna lick balls, because 
                         they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely 
                         each other's."

               Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, wide-eyed.

                                     JAY
                         Eww.
                              (reading further)
                         "Yes--they are real people. Real 
                         stupid people. Signed, Darth Randal."
                              (to Bob)
                         Motherfucker! It's time we wrote 
                         something back! Type this shit down.

               Silent Bob starts typing as Jay dictates.

                                     JAY
                         All you motherfuckers are gonna pay. 
                         You are the ones who are the ball-
                         lickers.  We're gonna fuck your 
                         mothers whole you watch and cry like 
                         little bitches. Once we get to 
                         Hollywood and find those Miramax 
                         fucks who are making the movie, we're 
                         gonna make 'em eat our shit, then 
                         shit our shit, then eat their shit 
                         which is made of our shit that we 
                         made 'em eat. Then all you 
                         motherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay 
                         and Silent Bob.

               Silent Bob finishes typing and presses "Return". He and Jay 
               nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking 
               up at the menu board.

                                     JAY
                         That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat 
                         our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get 
                         back on the road, get to Hollywood, 
                         and stop that fucking movie from 
                         getting made. No more hairy-bush 
                         nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye 
                         on the prize, and not let nothing--
                         and I mean NOTHING--distract me.

               As Jay finishes speaking, he looks to the O.C. doors and 
               freezes.  A gorgeous GIRL walks through the front doors, all 
               in SLO-MO to the tune of Prince's The Most Beautiful Girl in 
               the World. She's bathed in light, glowing.

               She bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us.

               Jay is mouth-agape wide eyed. Silent Bob looks at him, then 
               at the O.C.Girl. He slowly waves his hand in front of Jay's 
               eyes, getting zero response.

               JAY'S POV

               The Girl smiles at us. His POV goes from her face, down to 
               her breasts, then down to her crotch.

               Jay moves past Silent Bob and meets the Girl in the middle 
               of the floor. He embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss 
               on her mouth. After a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager 
               to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous 
               with the music. The Girl kindly tries to deter him.

               But it's just a fantasy. Jay's still standing there next to 
               Silent Bob, but he is sporting a huge BONER. Silent Bob rolls 
               his eyes. He grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it 
               over Jay's boner, just as the Girl joins them in line. She 
               smiles at the zombified Jay.

                         Oh my God. Do you get free refills 
                         with that?

                                     JAY
                         Oh, what--this? I just wear this for 
                         protection. You know--so no guys try 
                         to grab my shit.

                                     GIRL
                         Hi. I'm Justice.

                                     JAY
                              (dreamily)
                         And I am so fucking yours--

               Silent Bob pokes Jay, who shakes of his daze.

                                     JAY
                         I mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my 
                         hereto life-mate, Silent Bob.

                                     JUSTICE
                         It's nice to meet you.

                                     JAY
                         Justice, hunh? That's a nice name.
                              (under his breath, to 
                              Bob)
                         Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F-
                         U-C-K-I-N-G--
                              (back to Justice)
                         So you come here often?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Oh, I'm not from around here. My 
                         friends and I are taking a road trip, 
                         and we just stopped to grab something 
                         to eat.

                                     JAY
                         Your friends, hunh? Where they at?

                                     JUSTICE
                              (pointing)
                         Out there. By that van.

               Jay and Bob look past Justice to see a VAN with three other 
               gorgeous GIRLS stretching outside of it, throwing their hair 
               around, looking incredibly sexy.

               Without looking at Silent Bob, Jay quietly says to him--

                                     JAY
                         Dude--I think I just filled the cup.

               INT. VAN--DAY

               Jay and Bob climb into the can, getting odd looks from the 
               other Girls, Justice follows them in, tossing the fast food 
               to her friends.

                                     JAY
                         Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent 
                         Bob are in the Hizz-ouse!!!

                                     SISSY
                         Who the fuck are these guys?

                                     JUSTICE
                         This is Jay and Silent Bob.
                              (to Jay and Bob)
                         Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and 
                         Chrissy.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Where the fuck did they come from?

                                     JUSTICE
                         I met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch 
                         a ride.

                                     SISSY
                         I don't know if that's such a great 
                         idea. Jussy.

                                     JAY
                         Sure it is, Juggs.

                                     MISSY
                         Oh my god--he just called Sissy 
                         "Juggs"!

                                     CHRISSY
                         I'm on it.

               Chrissy lunges toward Jay, pulling a knife.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Chrissy, no!

               Sissy stops Chrissy, shoving a burger into her hands.

                                     SISSY
                         We're in the middle of suburbia, 
                         Chrissy. Let's try to act like it.

                                     CHRISSY
                         And what-stupid ass little foul-
                         mouthed bitch-boys don't get their 
                         balls cut off in suburbia?

                                     JAY
                              (oblivious)
                         What's with the knife? We having 
                         cake or something?

                                     CHRISSY
                         Holy shit--he's retarded, to boot.

                                     JAY
                              (to Silent Bob)
                         Yo--she called you retarded.

                                     SISSY
                              (to Justice)
                         What's wrong with you, Justice? You 
                         do remember where we're going, don't 
                         you?

                                     MISSY
                         That we do have a job to do?

                                     JUSTICE
                         They're just gonna tag along for a 
                         few miles. They won't get in the 
                         way, I promise.
                              (cutesy)
                         Please?

                                     SISSY
                         Fine--they can ride with us. But 
                         they're so out of here before we get 
                         to Boulder.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Honest Injun.

                                     CHRISSY
                         "Honest Injun"?
                              (to Sissy)
                         I can't believe what a pushover you 
                         are.

                                     JAY
                         And I can't believe fine-ass bitches 
                         like yourselves eat that shit. Don't 
                         you know fast food makes girls fart?

               Suddenly, Jay and Bob are parted by BRENT, who's getting 
               into the van.

                                     BRENT
                         Say--what's all this talk about 
                         farting?

               Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy immediately go from disgusted to 
               sweet and airy, totally switching characters.

                                     SISSY/CHRISSY/MISSY
                         Hi Brent!

                                     SISSY
                         This is Brent. He's with us, too.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Brent, tell these sillies that girls 
                         don't fart.

                                     BRENT
                         Of course they don't! Only skeevy 
                         stoners fart.

               The very white Brent puts his hand out to be slapped by Jay 
               and Silent Bob.

                                     BRENT
                         What up, homies?
                              (off the Girls)
                         Wow, Three guys, four girls--
                              (to Jay and Bob)
                         What's the count boys?

               Jay and Bob look at each other and roll their eyes.

               EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

               The van drives down the road. We hear singing from inside.

               INT. VAN--DAY

               Brent strums a guitar and sings, as the Girls and Jay and 
               Bob listen, rolling eyes.

                                     BRENT
                         Hey there mister science-guy. Don't 
                         spray that aerosol in my eye. For I 
                         don't really want to die. I'm a noble 
                         rabbit!

                                     JAY
                         What're you guys, like a cover band 
                         or something?

                                     SISSY
                         We're the Kansas State chapter of 
                         S.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal

                                     CHRISSY
                         And we're on our way to Colorado to 
                         give Provasik a piece of our minds!

               Everyone lets out a whoop, except Jay and Bob.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are you bitches babbling 
                         about?

                                     BRENT
                         Hey! Watch the language little boy. 
                         There are females present.

               Jay and Silent Bob eyeball Brent, until Justice distracts 
               them.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical 
                         lab where they perform gross 
                         experiments on animals.

                                     JAY
                         So, what kind of animals are we 
                         talking about here--like bears and 
                         rhinos?

                                     BRENT
                         No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats... 
                         heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak 
                         for them, who will?
                              (touches Justice's 
                              arm)
                         Right, Jussy?

               Jay sees this and his eyes flare over the competition.  After 
               a beat, he relaxes.

                                     JAY
                         Hey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you 
                         over here for a second?

               Brent joins Jay, strumming his guitar. Jay addresses him 
               confidentially.

                                     JAY
                         Be honest, yo--you're down with this 
                         for the fine-ass pussy, right?

                                     BRENT
                         I'm down with this because I love 
                         animals, stupid.

                                     JAY
                         Even sheep?

                                     BRENT
                         Of course. Sheep are beautiful 
                         creatures.

                                     JAY
                         They are beautiful, aren't they?

                                     BRENT
                         Oh God, yes.

                                     JAY
                         So then you'd fuck a sheep?

                                     BRENT
                         What is your damage little boy? You've 
                         got a sick and twisted world 
                         perspective.

                                     JAY
                         No, you misunderstand me, Prince 
                         Valiant. I mean if you were another 
                         sheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if 
                         you were another sheep?

                                     BRENT
                         I--suppose so.

                                     JAY
                         That's what I thought.
                              (suddenly loudly, to 
                              all)
                         YO! THIS MOTHERFUCKER AIN'T ONE OF 
                         US! HE JUST SAID HE'D FUCK A SHEEP!

               EXT. HIGHWAY--DAY

               The side door of the van slides open and Brent gets hurled 
               out of the moving vehicle. Jay throws his guitar at him as 
               well, yelling and flipping the bird as the van drives off.

                                     JAY
                         YA DIRTY SHEEP FUCKER!!!

               The van drives down the road.

               INT. VAN--SAME

               Missy drives. Sissy sits in the passenger seat. Chrissy kneels 
               between them.

                                     CHRISSY
                         What the fuck are we gonna do now?

                                     SISSY
                         Shut up, I'm thinking.

               In the back, Justice studies some blueprints. Jay joins her, 
               and she quickly folds them up.

                                     JAY
                         Is Hollywood near where we're going?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Is that where you guys are from?

                                     JAY
                         Ch'yeah, right. Jersey represent!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you 
                         all the way out here?

                                     JAY
                         Well, we couldn't hang in front of 
                         the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of 
                         the strainen-en order, which sucks 
                         ass 'cause it's been like our home 
                         since we were kids. Silent Bob even 
                         busted his cherry there.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (to Bob)
                         You did? I'll bet she was a lucky 
                         girl.

               Bob blushes, Jay doesn't like that Justice's attention has 
               strayed.

                                     JAY
                         Look, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying 
                         to tell a story here.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Sorry.

                                     JAY
                         Anyway, we were talking to Brodie 
                         and he said there's gonna be a 
                         Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we 
                         went to see Holden McNeil, and he 
                         showed us the Internet, and that's 
                         where we found all these fucking 
                         little jerkoffs were saying shit 
                         about us. So we decided to go to 
                         Hollywood and stop the movie from 
                         getting made.  And now we're here.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Wow. I have no idea what you just 
                         said.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like 
                         animals, huh?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Sure.

                                     JAY
                         That's cool. Even snakes?

                                     JUSTICE
                         You can't exclude an animal just 
                         because it's not cuddly. Of course I 
                         like snakes.

                                     JAY
                         How about trouser snakes?

                                     JUSTICE
                         What's a trouser snake?

               Just then, a little JAY DEVIL appears on Jay's left shoulder.

                                     JAY DEVIL
                              (to Jay)
                         What the fuck are you waiting for? 
                         She went for the setup! Reach in 
                         your fucking pants, and pull yer 
                         cock out, bitch! That's the kinda 
                         shit girls like!

               Suddenly another little JAY DEVIL appears in Jay's right 
               shoulder.

                                     JAY DEVIL 2
                         Right about here's where the angel's 
                         supposed to show up and tell you not 
                         to pull your dick out. But we bitch-
                         slapped that little fuck and sent 
                         him packing, so it's smooth sailing. 
                         Let 'er rip, boy!

               They disappear in little puffs of smoke and Jay shoves his 
               hand down his pants, getting ready to whip out his dick, 
               when suddenly a little JAY ANGEL appears on his shoulder, 
               rubbing a swollen jaw.

                                     JAY ANGEL
                         Sorry I'm late. So what's the deal 
                         here?
                              (looks down)
                         Oh, shit--you're not thinking of 
                         whipping your dick out at this fine 
                         piece of woman, are you?

               Jay thinks, then nods "Yes." The Jay Angel rolls his eyes, 
               and slaps him.

                                     JAY ANGEL
                         Tell you what: look at Silent Bob. 
                         See if he thinks it's a good idea to 
                         whip your dick out.

               Jay looks to Silent Bob. Silent Bob looks from Jay's hand in 
               his pants to Jay and shakes his head "no," sternly. Jay 
               withdraws his hand from his pants. The Jay Angel nods, 
               satisfied.

                                     JAY ANGEL
                         That's it, boy--put the dick down. 
                         You gotta go from the heart, yo. No 
                         little perv bullshit will do for 
                         this one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de 
                         la Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the 
                         shit out of two suckerpunching little 
                         bitches. Remember--don't pull your 
                         dick out until she asks you to.
                              (beat)
                         Or until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg!  
                         The Jay Angel blinks away. Justice 
                         looks at Jay, a bit confused.

                                     JAY
                         Don't ask.
                              (beat)
                         So, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like 
                         me do to help the animals?

                                     JUSTICE
                         You really don't want to help us--

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are you talking about? 
                         Sure I do. I'd do anything for you.

               Justice smiles. Jay tries to recover.

                                     JAY
                         I mean, youse guys! I'd do anything 
                         for youse guys. For the lift and 
                         shit.

                                     JUSTICE
                         You sure?

                                     JAY
                         Sure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I. 
                         Fuck

                                     JUSTICE
                         Well--okay. Let me talk it over with 
                         the other girls and get back to you.

                                     JAY
                         You do that.

               Jay takes Justice's hand and kisses it.

                                     JAY
                         I'll be right here.

               He winks at her, smiles and moves to the other side of the 
               can, near Silent Bob.  He's still smiling at Justice and 
               winking when he looks to Silent Bob who stares at him blankly, 
               then imitates Jay's hand-kissing back at him, Jay scowls.

                                     JAY
                         Fuck you. Fatty.

               EXT. CONVENIENCE STORY--DAY

               The van pulls up and all pile out, stretching. The Girls 
               head toward the store.  Justice calls over to Jay and Silent 
               Bob.

                                     JUSTICE
                         You guys want anything from inside?

                                     JAY
                         No, we're cool, thanks hon.

               Justice smiles and heads inside. Jay and Silent Bob study 
               the front of the foreign convenience store. They look for a 
               place to lean, try a few spots out, then settle into one. 
               After a beat--

                                     JAY
                         It just ain't the same, is it? This 
                         place licks balls compared to Quick 
                         Stop.

               Silent Bob shakes his head "Yeah."

                                     JAY
                         And speaking of licking balls--how 
                         'bout that Justice chick? She is too 
                         fine.  And she smells so fucking 
                         pretty. She's got a nice voice, too. 
                         And that body?  Smoking. You know, 
                         she never once said "fuck off," when 
                         I was talking to her, or pulled out 
                         the pepper spray, or nothing. I tell 
                         ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one.

               INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

               Justice is at the microwave when she's suddenly surrounded 
               by the other girls.

                                     MISSY
                         Smooth move, Justice.

                                     CHRISSY
                              (slapping Justice 
                              upside the head)
                         Nice going, Four Eyes!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Ow!

                                     SISSY
                         Why the fuck did you let that little 
                         stoner throw Brent our of the van?!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Oh please--if I had to listen to one 
                         more of those stupid songs, I was 
                         going to throw him out myself.

                                     SISSY
                         We needed Brent, Justice! He was our 
                         patsy!

                                     JUSTICE
                         We'll find someone else. Besides, I 
                         didn't see you trying to stop Jay 
                         from throwing him out.

                                     SISSY
                         Because I didn't want to blow our 
                         cover!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Cover, shmover--you all hated his 
                         songs, too.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Not as much as I hate you.

               Justice offers Chrissy a cold glance,

                                     CHRISSY
                         Fuck, if I don't get to kill someone 
                         soon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone!

                                     SISSY
                              (rubbing Chrissy's 
                              shoulders)
                         Don't mind Chrissy. She's just a 
                         little too wound for sound.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Then how about you help me take the 
                         edge off?

               Chrissy grabs Missy forcefully and the pair make out, hot 
               and heavy in the middle of the convenience store. Other 
               customers regard them wide-eyed.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (to Customers)
                         They're really good friends.

                                     SISSY
                              (TO CHRISSY AND MISSY)
                         Would you two knock it off? We're in 
                         the fucking heartland here! Try to 
                         blend!

                                     JUSTICE
                         They already do--she's the milkmaid, 
                         and she's the cow.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Oh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow, 
                         bitch. And now I'm gonna rip your 
                         head off and fuck your spine stump.

                                     SISSY
                         Enough!
                              (calm to Justice)
                         We have a very simple gang here, 
                         Justice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's 
                         the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl. 
                         But lately, I'm having a hard time 
                         figuring out what you're doing here.

                                     JUSTICE
                         That makes two of us.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Shit--your name doesn't even fit the 
                         rhyme scheme.

                                     JUSTICE
                         That's because very few names rhyme 
                         with "douchebag."

                                     CHRISSY
                              (getting in her face)
                         You're dancing on my last nerve, 
                         Strawberry Shortcake.
                              (to Sissy)
                         You deal with the weak link. I'm 
                         gonna take Missy into the dirty 
                         convenience store bathroom and hate-
                         fuck the shit out of her.

               Chrissy drags Missy off. Justice and Sissy watch them go.

                                     JUSTICE
                         And you said letting them read all 
                         that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to 
                         anything.

                                     SISSY
                         Don't change the subject. You know 
                         what you have to do now, right? Since 
                         you let our patsy slip away, you've 
                         gotta convince the little kid and 
                         that fat guy to take his place. 
                         They've gotta break into Provasik 
                         now.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Uh-uh!

                                     SISSY
                         Uh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out 
                         of this gang. Just use the little 
                         one's crush to convince him, since 
                         he's so fucking in love with you.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Jay? No he's not.

                                     SISSY
                         What--am I blind? He wasn't kissing 
                         your hand back in the van like he 
                         was fucking Lord Byron?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Well, maybe he was just raised with 
                         manners.

               EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

               A GIRL walks past Jay and Bob, heading out of the store.

                                     JAY
                              (to exited Girl)
                         YO, BABY! YOU EVER HAVE YOUR ASSHOLE 
                         LICKED BY A FAT MAN IN AN OVERCOAT?!
                              (to Bob)
                         Yeah.

               INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

               Sissy continues to confront Justice.

                                     SISSY
                         You're the one that brought the kid 
                         in, Jussy. So you've gotta make 
                         amends.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Jay is not taking Brent's place as 
                         the patsy.

                                     SISSY
                         That kid and his quite friend are 
                         our only options at this point. Now 
                         we got about two hours before we get 
                         to Boulder. That gives you plenty of 
                         of time to work on him.

                                     JUSTICE
                         I'm not gonna do it.

                                     SISSY
                         Why the fuck not?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Because he's just to so innocent!

               Justice looks out the window and smiles, seeing Jay dancing 
               alongside Bob.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Look at him--

               EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME

               Jay's dancing still, but now we hear what he's SINGING to 
               Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         I'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little 
                         asshole! Finger-bang and tea-bang my 
                         balls--in her mouth! Where? Where? 
                         In her mouth--balls-a-plenty in her 
                         mouth!  Balls, balls, sweaty balls--

               INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--SAME

               Sissy eyeballs Justice, who's still looking out at Jay.

                                     SISSY
                         Who's it going to be, Jussy--him or 
                         us?

               Justice looks at Sissy. Sissy nods at her. Justice looks 
               back out at Jay.

               INT. VAN--DAY

               Justice talks to Jay and Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         Steal a monkey? Shit--no problem.

                                     JUSTICE
                         It's not really stealing--it's 
                         liberating it, and--
                              (finally hears him)
                         Wait a second--did you say, "No 
                         problem"?

                                     JAY
                         Yeah, Fuck--we steal monkeys all the 
                         time.
                              (to Bob)
                         Right, Lunchbox?

               Silent Bob glares at Jay.

                                     JUSTICE
                         It's not like it's a bad thing. It's 
                         for a good cause.

                                     JAY
                         Oh, it for the best cause, mon cheri--
                              (takes her hand)
                         The cause of love.
                              (kisses her hand, 
                              then releases)
                         Snoogans--

                                     JUSTICE
                         What the heck is that?

                                     JAY
                         What's what?

                                     JUSTICE
                         "Snoogans," I believe it was.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck do you think it means? 
                         It means "I'm kidding."

                                     JUSTICE
                         Ohhh. Well, that's too bad.

               She smiles at Jay, touches his chin and heads to the front 
               of the van. Jay plays it cool until she's out of sight, then 
               humps silent Bob's leg like a dog.

                                     JAY
                              (singing)
                         I can't believe I'm gonna get some 
                         pussy for stealing a monkey!
                              (speaking)
                         If I'd known it was that easy, I'd've 
                         been stealing monkeys since I was 
                         like seven and shit.

               Jay looks at Silent Bob, who clearly disapproves.

                                     JAY
                         Don't, motherfucker. Don't you ruin 
                         this for me. Me and Justice are gonna 
                         get married one day, so don't be 
                         giving me that "we-ain't-stealing-no-
                         monkey" look.  I'm Morris Day; you're 
                         Jerome, bitch. Don't forget that. 
                         That girl? That girl's in love with 
                         me.

               Up front, Justice talks to Sissy, while Missy drives.

                                     JUSTICE
                         They're gonna do it.

                                     SISSY
                         Good. They do their part--
                              (pats a video camera)
                         And we'll do ours.

               Justice eyes Sissy, then slumps in her seat.

               EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

               The Van rolls up across the street from the Provasik Labs, 
               parking in front of another large building.

               INT. VAN--SAME

               Jay and Silent bob get out, along with Justice. They wear 
               Ninja masks. Missy and Chrissy follow.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Remember--we meet back here when 
                         you're done. You sure you're okay 
                         with this?

                                     JAY
                         As sure as I am that you're the 
                         hottest bitch I ever seen.

               Chrissy lunges at Jay, Missy holds her back, dragging Chrissy 
               away.

                                     JAY
                         What's twisting that bitch's tits?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Maybe it's because women don't like 
                         to be called "bitches," Jay.

                                     JAY
                         They don't? Well how 'bout "piece of 
                         ass"?

                                     JUSTICE
                         How about not.

                                     JAY
                         Well, what the fuck am I supposed to 
                         call you, then?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Something sweet, you big goof. 
                         Something nice.

                                     JAY
                              (thinks; then)
                         Boo-boo kitty fuck.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (laughing)
                         Okay.  That's a start.

               Sissy jumps out of the van, holding the video camera, aiming 
               it at Jay and Bob.

                                     SISSY
                         Jay, before you go, could you say 
                         something into the camera about the 
                         clitoris.

                                     JAY
                         What?

                                     JUSTICE
                              (to Sissy)
                         Man you are such a bitch--

                                     SISSY
                              (off Justice; to Jay)
                         She's just a little embarrassed. 
                         See, Jussy and I are putting together 
                         this documentary for our Human 
                         Sexuality class, and we need a male 
                         perspective on the clitoris.

                                     JAY
                         The female clitoris?

                                     SISSY
                         Uh--yeah.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Jay, you don't have to do this.

               She elbows Sissy.

                                     JAY
                         Nah, it's cool, hon. There's a few 
                         things I can say about the clit that 
                         I's like you to hear.
                              (clears throat; into 
                              camera)
                         I am the master of the clit! I make 
                         that shit work! It does what ever 
                         the fuck I tell it to do!  No one 
                         rules the clit like me!
                              (off Silent Bob)
                         Not this little fuck! None of you 
                         little fucks out there! I am the 
                         clit commander!!! Remember that--
                         commander of all clits!

               Jay proceeds to make some pussy-eating faces. Justice shakes 
               her head at Sissy, who snaps the camera closed and smiles.

                                     SISSY
                         Awesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger.

               Sissy climbs back into the van.

                                     JAY
                              (to Justice)
                         So--can I get a little kiss for good 
                         luck?

               Justice smiles at Jay, then kisses him sweetly on the lips.

                                     JAY
                         So--can I get a little blow job for 
                         good luck?

               Justice smiles and pulls Jay's mask down. He heads off, 
               revealing Silent Bob behind him, lips puckered, handing in 
               midair. Jay reached back into the frame, pulling Bob out. 
               Justice watches them go.

                                     SISSY
                         Jussy. C'mon.

               Justice climbs back into the van.

               INT. VAN--SAME

               Justice sits, glaring at Sissy.

                                     SISSY
                         Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my 
                         authority again, you lose your fucking 
                         fronts, you got that?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Yes, sir.

               Sissy takes the tape out of the camera and hands it off to 
               Missy, beside whom is a bag full of high-tech equipment.

                                     SISSY
                         Phase One, down. While we're executing 
                         Phase Two, you edit that tape and 
                         grab a new car.

                                     MISSY
                         No sweat.

                                     SISSY
                         Let's suit up.

               EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

               Jay and Silent bob tuck-and-roll across the front lawn, 
               stopping at the building. Silent Bob pulls a GRAPPLING GUN 
               out of his coat. He fires it into the air as Jay quickly 
               gives the "metal" sign, and the pair are lifted out-of-frame.

               INT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

               It's dead quiet and still. Then, the pair smash through a 
               window, landing in the floor in a ball. They lift their Ninja 
               hoods. Jay glares at Silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         You fat fuck--

               INT. VAN--NIGHT

               Missy peers through binoculars out the window.

                                     SISSY
                         They in?

                                     MISSY
                         You can say that.

                                     SISSY
                         Time to shine. Let's go.

               EXT. VAN--NIGHT

               The quartet piles out of the van, and we get our first look 
               at them: sexily geared up for action, wearing all black. 
               They head for a SEPARATE BUILDING.  Stopping at the front 
               door.

               Sissy gestures elaborately to Missy, and Missy gestures 
               elaborately back, racing away into the night. Justice offers 
               Sissy a look.

                                     JUSTICE
                         You are so gay.

               Chrissy sticks a box on the door and presses a button. On a 
               digital readout, numbers roll until they stop on four 
               different digits. The door lock CLICKS open.

                                     SISSY
                         Once we're inside, I want complete 
                         silence.
                              (holding up high-tech 
                              device)
                         Missy whipped this up. It counts our 
                         decibel level. If it goes into the 
                         red--alarm, we're dead. So not even 
                         the slightest noise, got it?

               Justice blows her off. Sissy enters the building, followed 
               closely by Chrissy.  Justice lingers at the door, taking one 
               last look back at the Provasik Building, fretting for Jay 
               and Bob.

                                     SISSY
                              (pokes her head back 
                              out)
                         Justice! Move your ass!

               Justice heads inside. We PAN up to reveal a sign that reads: 
               BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE.

               INT. PROVASIK TESTING ROOM--NIGHT

               Jay and Bob stand there, looking around the room.

               It's lines with cages, all of which contain sad-looking 
               ANIMALS.  A tear forms in silent Bob's eye. Jay rolls his 
               eyes and hits him.

                                     JAY
                         Stay frosty, you big fucking softie. 
                         We've got a job to do.

               Silent Bob nods and clicks on a flashlight. The pair wade 
               through the cages. Jay stops at an EMERGENCY BOX hanging on 
               the wall. Inside it, there's a pistol.

                                     JAY
                         Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal 
                         tranquilizer. This shit fucks you up 
                         like Percocets!

               Jay elbows the glass, breaking it. He takes the gun out and 
               tosses it to Bob.

                                     JAY
                         Hold this. Later, me and Justice can 
                         shoot each other with it and fuck 
                         like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg.

               Silent Bob rolls he eyes and sticks the gun in his coat. The 
               pair look through the cages, until HEAR the distinct SOUND 
               OF A MONKEY. Jay directs Silent Bob's flashlight to the cage 
               from where the sound emitted. He smiles.

                                     JAY
                              (reading)
                         "Suzanne." Boo-yah.

               INT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT

               The three Girls stand at the end of a large hallway. At the 
               other end is a glass case, full of DIAMONDS.

               Sissy pulls and aerosol can from her utility belt and sprays 
               the air in the hallway. She watches the decibel monitor, 
               which rises only slightly at the sound of the spray. Suddenly, 
               within the mist, laser beams become apparent.

               Sissy hands the decibel monitor to Chrissy and takes a few 
               steps back, shaking her hands to limber up. She then runs 
               forward and does an impressive series of flips down the 
               hallway, not touching a single laser beam.

               Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

               Once Sissy's flipping comes to a stop at the other end of 
               the hallway near the Diamond case, she makes a hand gesture 
               to Justice. Justice nods, and proceeds to do the same series 
               of flips down the hallway, not tripping the alarm.

               Chrissy checks the decibel monitor, which rises only slightly.

               Justice lands beside Sissy, and then Sissy gestures to 
               Chrissy.

               Chrissy tosses the decibel monitor over the laser beams, 
               Sissy catches it, and the monitor rises only slightly.

               Then, Chrissy proceeds with her series of flips, which are 
               even more impressive than the other two, including running 
               up walls and pushing into handstand flips.  When she passes 
               the last laser beam, she lands between Sissy and Justice, 
               arms in the air like a gymnast. Then, she lets out a loud, 
               manly FART.

               The decibel monitor goes red and an alarm starts RINGING 
               through the building.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Holy fuck--the little stoner was 
                         right--

               Sissy shutters the glass surrounding the Diamonds. She ours 
               them into a bag, and races back down the hallway, followed 
               by Justice and Chrissy.

               EXT. BOULDER DIAMOND EXCHANGE--NIGHT

               The Girls emerge from the Diamond Exchange, just as Missy 
               pulls up in a CONVERTIBLE.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Boom Box!

               Missy tosses a metal box to Chrissy, who catches it and races 
               toward the van, while Sissy and Justice pile into the 
               convertible.

                                     SISSY
                         I can't believe it. Months of planning 
                         and it's all blown by a fucking fart.

                                     JUSTICE
                         We can't just leave them like this! 
                         That alarm's gonna bring the cops 
                         here any minute!

                                     SISSY
                         That was always the plan, Justice! 
                         They take the heat off of is long 
                         enough until we can get out of town!

               Chrissy attaches the metal box to the side of the van.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Kaboom, you little stoner fucks.

               The girls pull up in the convertible and Chrissy jumps into 
               the car with them.

                                     CHRISSY
                         It's set. Let's roll.

               The convertible screeches away, leaving the can sitting there. 
               The metal has magnetically attached to the side is counting 
               down from two minutes.

               INT. PROVASIK TESTING LAB--NIGHT

               Jay and Bob carry a large canvas bag between them. Something 
               seems to move inside it. The head for the exit, but Silent 
               bob hesitates, offering a sad look to the animals in all the 
               cages. Jay hits him.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are you looking at? 
                         There ain't no snacks here, man! Now 
                         we got what we came for, so let's 
                         get the fuck out!

               Silent Bob half-gestures to the cages, forlorn. Jay shakes 
               his head frustrated.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah, it's sad! But what the fuck 
                         are we supposed to do about it?

               Silent bob offers Jay a look.

               EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--NIGHT

               The front doors burst open, spilling out Jay, Silent Bob 
               (carrying their bag), and HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS--cats, dogs, 
               birds, rabbits. All race off into the night.

               Jay and Bob race toward the van. Jay screams at it.

                                     JUSTICE
                         JUSTICE! OPEN THE DOORS!

               Suddenly, Jay and Bob stop dead in their tracks.

                                     JAY
                         Oh shit--

               Three COP CARS screech up, the van between them and Jay and 
               Bob. The COPS leap out of their cruisers, guns drawn. Jay 
               looks to Bob, pissed

                                     COP
                         DROP THE BAG! BEFORE THIS THING TURNS 
                         EXPLOSIVE!

               The counter on the device attached to the van hits "0," and 
               the van BLOWS UP.  Jay and Bob get thrown backwards in one 
               direction, the Cops in the other.  On all fours, Jay looks 
               at the burning shell of the van, a tear forming in his eye.

                                     JAY
                         Justice--

               We crane up from him as he bellows--

                                     JAY
                         JUUUSSSTTTTIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!!

               Silent Bob grabs Jay and drags him out of frame, still 
               carrying the bag.

               EXT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY

               We start on a sign on the door that reads: Federal Wildlife 
               Marshal, Colorado Field Office, then pull back to see a DEPUTY 
               opening the door and heading inside.

               INT. FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL'S OFFICE--DAY

               The Deputy enters just as a FAX is coming through at an 
               operations board. He rips it off, reading it. His eyes go 
               wide.

                                     DEPUTY
                         Oh, fudge...
                              (calling off)
                         Marshal Willenholly!

               INT. BATHROOM--SAME

               MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY sits on the bowl, staring at Four Legged 
               Law-Man magazine, eyeing it lustily. Below frame, he jerks 
               off.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Yeah, you chug that ass-cock baby--
                         It takes two hands to hold doesn't 
                         it--?  Uhhh--

               As he climaxes, a ganging at the door disrupts him.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         WHAT?! WHAT?! I'M READING!

                                     DEPUTY (O.S.)
                         Sir, we got a report of a break-in 
                         at Provasik Pharmaceuticals' testing 
                         lab.

               Willenholly emerges from the bathroom, holding the magazine. 
               There's a massive wet spot on the front of his pants.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Have you read this article on the 
                         mule-suckers in Tijuana? Good God, I 
                         wish that was in our jurisdiction--
                         I'd shut down every last one of those 
                         ass-cock chuggers, personally.

               The Deputy looks at the stain on Willenholly's pants, then 
               at Willenholly.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         What? "Ass" means "donkey."

                                     DEPUTY
                         Yes, sir.
                              (hands him a fax)

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (looks at fax)
                         Boulder, hunh? Well, gas up the jet.

                                     DEPUTY
                         We don't have a jet, sir. And 
                         Boulder's only ten minutes away.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Then gas up the next best thing.

               EXT. PROVASIK MEDICAL LABS--DAY

               There are FIRE TRUCKS all over the place now. The burned out 
               van is being poured over by Cops. Just then, Willenholly 
               pulls up on a MOPED. He parks it and surveys the wreckage.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         My, oh my, oh my. Who let the cats 
                         out?
                              (thinks)
                         Wait--is that right?

                                     COP 1 (O.S.)
                         Excuse me--who the hell are you?

               Willenholly rips down the Velcro patch on his jacket, 
               revealing a badge.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Federal Wildlife Marshal. This 
                         investigation is now under my 
                         jurisdiction.

                                     COP 1
                         Oh really? And why is that?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Because someone let a whole mess of 
                         animals out of their cages, sir.

                                     COP 1
                         Well, we believe that was just a 
                         diversionary tactic used to call 
                         attention away from the real heist 
                         over here at the Diamond Exchange.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Yeah, right. That's a believable 
                         scenario. It sounds more like 
                         something out of a bad movie.

               Willenholly and the Cop look at the camera. Then, another 
               COP joins them.

                                     COP 2
                         Sir, the Provasik people say they've 
                         rounded all their animals up, except 
                         for one: an orangutan.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Listen up, ladies and gentlemen! Our 
                         fugitive has been on the run for 6 
                         hours!  Average simian foot speed 
                         over uneven ground--barring injuries 
                         or preoccupation with tire tubes, 
                         mites or bananas--is four miles an 
                         hour. That gives us a radius of twenty 
                         miles.

                                     COP 3
                              (calling out from 
                              crowd)
                         Twenty-four, sir!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         What?

                                     COP 3
                         Six hours times four miles an hour 
                         is twenty-four.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (doing the math in 
                              his head)
                         Yes. Yes, you're right. My bad. Twenty-
                         four miles. Now what I want out of 
                         all of you is a hard target search.

                                     COP 4
                         Excuse me, sir?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Yeah?

                                     COP 4
                         What does that mean, exactly--a "hard 
                         target search"? What's a "hard 
                         target"?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Well. It's--a target--that's--hard. 
                         Anyway--

                                     COP 4
                         So are you referring to the search's 
                         level of difficulty? Or is the hard 
                         target the monkey?

                                     COP 3
                         Or the people who stole the monkey?

               The COPS now chatter amongst themselves, to the effect of 
               "Yeah--It could mean that too--He's got a point--,"etc. 
               Willenholly rubs his temples.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Okay, how about this? What I want 
                         out of all of you is a thorough search 
                         of every gas station, residence, 
                         warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, 
                         outhouse, and doghouse in that area! 
                         Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles!

                                     COP 1
                         Wouldn't it make sense to put them 
                         up at every twenty-four miles--seeing 
                         as that's how far they'd have gotten 
                         in the last six hours?

               They begin chattering amongst themselves again. Willenholly 
               looks at them all, defeated. He starts to cry.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         This is so frustrating. It's just so 
                         hard sometimes--
                              (yelling)
                         YOUR FUGITIVE'S NAME IS SUZANNE! GO 
                         FIND HER!

               Another COP joins Willenholly, carrying a large, fat envelope.

                                     COP 5
                         Sir, this was just delivered to the 
                         station.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         What is it?

                                     COP 5
                         It's a tape from the terrorists who're 
                         claiming credit for the break-in.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Is it VHS or Beta? You know what--
                         never mind. Do you have a VCR?

               INT. OFFICE--DAY

               Willenholly and the Cops stare at the O.C. TV, shocked, as 
               the video ends.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Oh my God--
                              (without looking up)
                         Have the jet gassed up and ready to 
                         go at a moment's notice.

                                     COP
                         Sir, we don't have a jet; just a 
                         helicopter.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (dialing his cell 
                              phone)
                         Doesn't anybody have a jet anymore?
                              (into cell phone)
                         Plafsky? It is Willenholly. You gotta 
                         get me on the national news, pronto. 
                         Why?!  Because we may very well be 
                         dealing with the two most dangerous 
                         men on the planet!

               EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY

               Jay and Silent Bob sit close to each other, staring at--

               SUZANNE (the ORANGUTAN)--who sits on a log across from them, 
               staring back.

                                     JAY
                         This is Jussy's monkey
                              (to Suzanne, angrily)
                         JUSTICE DIED FOR YOU, YOU MONKEY 
                         FUCK!

               Suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly. Jay and 
               Silent Bob, startle, with Jay leaping behind Silent Bob and 
               pulling back as if he's going to strike.

                                     JAY
                              (to Silent Bob)
                         Do something. Tons of Fun!

               Silent Bob offers the ape a weak wave. Suzanne drops her 
               hands from her face and waves back. Jay cranes his neck to 
               see over silent Bob.

                                     JAY
                         Is that fucking thing waving at us?

               Suzanne nods. Jay steps out from behind Bob. They state at 
               the ape.

                                     JAY
                         Holy shit? That monkey understood 
                         us! Maybe it's some sort of super-
                         monkey!

               Suzanne offer them a "raspberry." Spitting as if the comment 
               was ridiculous. Jay and Silent Bob react with surprise at 
               this.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck was that for? It's not 
                         a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo?

               Suzanne holds her nose, as if to say, "Congo stunk." Silent 
               Bob smiles in agreement and amusement. Jay looks at him, 
               stung.

                                     JAY
                         You're my bitch. You get my back. 
                         Don't go joining this chimp's side.

               Jay looks around the woods, formulating a thought. Silent 
               Bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers.

                                     JAY
                         Yo--what if there's more super monkeys 
                         up in the lab? Maybe they're making 
                         an army of 'em up there! Holy shit! 
                         Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the 
                         X-Files Roswell--style!

               JAY'S DELUSION: We enter into JAY'S HEAD and see--

               INT. LAB--DAY

               We PAN over from a chimp in a chemist's coat measuring liquids 
               in a pair of beakers to a chimp at a drafting table sketching 
               blueprints for an insidious war machine. An orangutan shakes 
               hands with a group of five well-dressed men, one of which 
               looks like the Cigarette Smoking Man from the X-Files.

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         Working in secret with a crew of 
                         double-dealing, nicotine-fiending 
                         fucks that're selling out the human 
                         race, these supermonkeys will use 
                         simian science and their genius IQ's 
                         to make man and monkey alike believe 
                         that they're the superior species!

               EXT. BALCONY--DAY

               A monkey dressed like Mussolini addresses a huge crowd of 
               apes, who wave fists in the air.

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         Then all it'll take is one little 
                         monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the 
                         dumber chimps into a frenzy, until 
                         they go all ape-shit and start 
                         demanding more bananas, better pay, 
                         and human flesh!

               EXT. FIELD--DAY

               Randal leads a pack of humans racing through a cornfield, 
               and is shot in the neck. He collapses, revealing a GORILLA 
               on horseback holding a rifle. Two other Gorillas throw a net 
               over him.

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         You'll have to be faster than Walt 
                         Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior 
                         gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, 
                         profit, and the occasional inter-
                         species blow-job. And if you don't 
                         wind up with a monkey hog in your 
                         mouth, you'll be captured, killed or 
                         worse...

               INT. LAB--DAY

               Cornelius and Zera-looking chimps dissect the brain of a 
               living, screaming, Dante.

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         Eaten alive!

               EXT. QUICK STOP--DAY

               The Quick Stop is overrun by vines in a jungle like 
               atmosphere. Monkeys exit the store carrying bunches of 
               bananas. The sign now reads: Ape Stop

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         Then these monkey fucks'll start 
                         wearing our clothes and rebuilding 
                         the world in their image.

               EXT. BEACH--DAY

               We start on a FULL SHOT of Jay on the beach, looking up, 
               then SNAP ZOOM OUT to REVEAL Jay kneeling before the beach 
               buried Statue of Liberty, screaming, his arms raised.

                                     JAY (V.O.)
                         And only those who outwit those damn 
                         dirty apes'll ever remember that it 
                         was MAN who once ruled the earth!

                                     JAY
                              (at statue)
                         YOU MANIACS! DAMN YOUSE!!! GODDAMN 
                         YOUSE ALL TO HELL!!!

                                            WE DISSOLVE FROM THIS IMAGE TO:

               EXT. UTAH ROADSIDE--DAY

               Another close-up of Jay's painted face. Behind him, Suzanne 
               and Silent Bob are playing patty-cake. Jay eyes Suzanne 
               angrily.

                                     JAY
                         Not on my watch, motherfucker!

               Jay turns and rushes Suzanne, ferociously.

                                     JAY
                         DIE, YOU SUPER-MONKEY FUCK! DIE!!!

               Jay trips on a root poking out of the ground and hits the 
               dirt. Suzanne then goes over to Jay, pulls his face to hers, 
               and kisses him on the lips.

                                     JAY
                         Alright--you can live. For now.

               Silent Bob helps Jay to his feet.

                                     JAY
                         You see that? Bitches love me.
                              (heading off)
                         Besides--we're in the fucking clear, 
                         yo. It's not like anyone knows we 
                         stole the monkey.

               INT. TV NEWS STATION--DAY

               An ANCHORMAN addresses the camera.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         I'm Reg Hartner and this is a News 
                         Now bulletin. A Provasik animal 
                         testing facility in boulder was the 
                         focus of an attack by a terroristic 
                         primate rescue syndicate calling 
                         themselves the Coalition for 
                         Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers. 
                         Or simply, C.L.I.T.

               A graphic of the C.L.I.T. logo appears beside him, nailing 
               home the joke.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         In a videotape sent to authorities 
                         this morning, credit for the 
                         liberation of an orangutan from the 
                         lab last night is taken by these men--

               A VIDEO CAPTURE of JAY and SILENT BOB from pre-break--in 
               appears on screen.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         --identified in literature that 
                         accompanies the tape as Jay and Silent 
                         Bob. In this chilling clip, they 
                         make it very clear that they are in 
                         control of the C.L.I.T.

               On screen is the C.L.I.T. Logo. A digitized voice narrates.

                                     DIGITIZED VOICE
                         We are the C.L.I.T. None of you are 
                         safe. Now tremble before the might 
                         of our merciless leader.

               The logo gives way to the video of Jay and Bob that Sissy 
               shot before the Provasik break-in. Jay's yelling into the 
               camera.

                                     JAY
                         I AM THE CLIT COMMANDER!!!

               Coming out of the video footage, the Anchorman shakes his 
               head, chilled.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         Terrifying. Here to help us understand 
                         this footage is Federal Wildlife 
                         Marshal Willenholly.

               PULL OUT to reveal Willenholly beside the Anchorman.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         Marshal, what can you tell us about 
                         the C.L.I.T.?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         From the intelligence we've been 
                         able to gather, we've discovered 
                         that the C.L.I.T. is a tiny offshoot 
                         of the L.A.B.I.A.

                                     ANCHORMAN

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Exactly. The men you saw in the video 
                         are believed to be the masterminds 
                         responsible for the frenzied C.L.I.T. 
                         activity last night. They go by the 
                         obvious code names "Jay" and "Silent 
                         Bob."
                              (to camera)
                         If you should come across them or 
                         any other C.L.I.T.-ies, please--
                         exercise extreme caution.

               INT. POTZEK'S INC. OFFICE--NIGHT

               On the TV screen is Willenholly and the video capture of Jay 
               and Silent Bob.  Holden looks up from his drawing table, 
               shocked.

                                     ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
                              (from TV)
                         Marshal, how do you respond to 
                         allegations that Federal Wildlife 
                         Marshal's Office allowed the C.L.I.T. 
                         to slip through their fingers?

                                     WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)
                         Nonsense. We're all over the C.L.I.T., 
                         Reg.

                                     HOLDEN
                              (shakes his head)
                         Nights like this, I miss dating a 
                         lesbian.

               INT. QUICK STOP--NIGHT

               From behind the register, Dante and Randal stare at the TV, 
               slack-jawed.

                                     ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
                              (from TV)
                         Is there also speculation that Jay 
                         and Silent bob may be responsible 
                         for the Diamond Exchange jewel heist 
                         that occurred in the same vicinity 
                         of downtown Boulder last night?

                                     WILLENHOLLY (O.S.)
                         There's nothing to suggest that, no. 
                         But these men are still to be 
                         considered very dangerous.

                                     RANDAL
                              (to Dante)
                         I told you that restraining order 
                         was a good idea.

               EXT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOMS--SAME

               On the second-floor terrace of a run-down, roadside motel, 
               Sissy, Missy and Chrissy dance in their undies and drink 
               champagne. On the first floor terrace below, Justice leans 
               against the open sliding glass door, watching the news report 
               on a TV inside the room with the volume turned way up.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                              (on TV)
                         Is that your cell phone?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (on TV)
                         Yes, Excuse me.
                              (on TV, into cell 
                              phone)
                         Federal Wildlife Marshal. I'm on my 
                         way!
                              (shuts phone; to 
                              anchorman)
                         We got 'em. They're in Utah.
                              (to camera)

                         is not recommended.

               Justice turns the TV off and yells up to Sissy.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Your tape worked. The news is all 
                         about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik 
                         break-in, with almost no mention of 
                         the Diamond heist.

                                     SISSY
                              (yelling down to 
                              Justice)
                         I told you those two were the perfect 
                         patsies. Now we lay low for awhile--
                         just in case--and start planning the 
                         next job.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Don't you feel any regret? Jay and 
                         Bob don't deserve this. They were 
                         really sweet.

                                     CHRISSY
                         The only thing I regret is not gutting 
                         that little trout-mouthed prick like 
                         a fish and playing Twister with his 
                         vitals.

                                     MISSY
                         You are so nasty.

                                     CHRISSY
                         I'll show you nasty, you little slut.

                                     SISSY
                         Would you two get a room?

                                     CHRISSY
                         Fine--we'll take yours.
                              (getting up in Sissy's 
                              face)
                         I am gonna stain your sheets, bi-
                         otch.

               Chrissy dances away with Missy, heading inside. Sissy rolls 
               her eyes.

                                     SISSY
                         Sarah Lawrence girls. Go figure.

                         Oh and not yours? You know, I don't 
                         get you, Justice. You used to be all 
                         about the girl stuff: stealing, 
                         boning, blowing shit up. Now you're 
                         like this little priss with a 
                         conscience. It's really a fucking 
                         drag.

                         If moping around over some little 
                         boy you're crushing on is being grown-
                         up, then pass me my Wonder Woman

                         for what we did to those guys?

                                     SISSY
                         Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty 
                         about setting up her boyfriend? Then 
                         how about taking a shower?

               Sissy dumps the bag of diamonds over the side of the terrace. 
               They rain down on Justice below. Just then a PIZZA DELIVERY 
               GUY approaches the lower terrace, carrying a stack of pizzas.

                                     PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
                         You the gals that ordered the pizzas?

                                     SISSY
                         This dopey bitch ordered the large 
                         plain, but I could go for some hot, 
                         thick, Sicilian.

                                     PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
                         No charge, lady.  He rushes into the 
                         motel, Justice sighs, looking up at 
                         the stars.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (quietly)
                         I'm sorry, Jay.

               INT. DINER--DAY

               Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne sit at a booth, eating. Jay 
               chews a burger while Silent Bob eats pancakes and Suzanne 
               digs into a banana split.

                                     JAY
                         You know, Justice died trying to 
                         save this monkey, so maybe we should 
                         keep her around. That way, we can 
                         honor her memory.

               Silent bob and Suzanne are oblivious, digging into their 
               food.

                                     JAY
                         Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing 
                         all sentimental, and you're all about 
                         a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't 
                         you glad we stopped to eat?  And you 
                         were all piss-scared the cops'd bust 
                         us or something. You know what I 
                         say?
                              (singing, a la NWA)

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                              (via bullhorn)
                         THIS IS THE UTAH STATE POLICE! WE 
                         KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE COME OUT WITH 
                         YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR, AND SURRENDER 
                         THE ORANGUTAN!

               Jay and Bob freeze and go wild-eyed for a beat. Then--

                                     JAY
                         You think they're talking to us?

               EXT. DINER--DAY

               There's a few COP CARS outside, and the SHERIFF is yelling 
               at the diner through his bullhorn. Beside him are the other 
               COPS.

                                     SHERIFF
                         YOU HAVE SIXTY SECONDS TO COMPLY.
                              (to other COPS)
                         Fuck it, Let's give 'em thirty.

               Suddenly Willenholly rushes up, dramatically ducking behind 
               the car, gun drawn.

                                     SHERIFF
                         The ape.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         What?

                                     SHERIFF
                         An orangutan's a member of the great 
                         ape family. It's not a monkey.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Look, who's the Federal Wildlife 
                         Marshal here?
                              (into bullhorn)
                         JAY AND SILENT BOB, THIS IS FEDERAL 
                         WILDLIFE MARSHAL WILLENHOLLY! YOUR 
                         C.L.I.T.  DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE. 
                         SURRENDER THE MONKEY IMMEDIATELY, 
                         AND YOU WON'T GET SHOT!

               INT. DINER--DAY

               Jay, Suzanne, and Silent Bob peer over the top of their booth, 
               like scared rats.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are you waiting for? 
                         Go out there and give 'em the monkey.

               Silent Bob looks to Jay, shocked.

                                     JAY
                         Oh, what, man? I said that shit before 
                         I knew they were gonna shoot us!  
                         Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't 
                         takin' no bullet for no monkey!

               Bob pulls Suzanne close to him, welling up with tears. Jay 
               rolls his eyes.

                                     JAY
                         Oh, brother--this is like something 
                         out of fucking Benji! Look man, maybe 
                         it's not that bad back at the lab! 
                         Maybe they experiment on 'em by, 
                         like making 'em fuck a bunch of 
                         different, good-looking monkeys. We 
                         don't know! Maybe they got it real 
                         sweet!

               Suzanne shakes her head "no." Bob points to her, as if she's 
               strengthening his point.

                                     JAY
                              (to Suzanne)
                         You stay out of this, you weepy little 
                         chimp!
                              (looks around thinking)
                         Fuck man, I ain't no strategist! 
                         You're the guy that makes the 
                         blueprints! I don't even have the 
                         fucking smarts of a little--

               Jay's eyes fall on a scared FAMILY in a nearby booth. There's 
               a little kid (around five or so), and he's wearing a hooded 
               sweatshirt and a baseball cap.

                                     JAY
                         --kid

               EXT. DINER--DAY

               Willenholly's on the bullhorn, yelling at the diner. The 
               Sheriff looks on.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         ANYONE NOT HARBORING A FUGITIVE MONKEY 
                         BETTER HIT THE DECK!  WE'RE GOING TO 
                         OPEN FIRE!
                              (to cops)
                         Everyone has bullets in their guns, 
                         right?

               Jay and Silent Bob emerge from the diner, with Suzanne between 
               them (they're holding her raised hands). She's now dressed 
               up in the sweatshirt and jeans the kid was wearing in the 
               diner, with the baseball cap pulled down over her face.  
               It's a pretty piss-poor disguise.

                                     JAY
                         Don't shoot! We're just trying to 
                         take our son out of this hostile 
                         environment!

               From behind the cop car, the Sheriff looks to Willenholly.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Their "son"?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Maybe they're one of those gay 
                         couples?

               Jay seizes on the idea. Silent Bob nods fervently.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah! We're gay! And this is our 
                         adopted love child! We're not from 
                         around here!  Don't make us go back 
                         to our liberal city home with a tales 
                         of prejudice and bigotry in the heart 
                         of Utah!
                              (whispers to Bob)
                         You see the shit I gotta put up with 
                         for you! Now I got this guy thinking 
                         I'm gay!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Oh God, this is the last thing I 
                         need--a bunch of uppity homosexuals 
                         shooting their mouth off in the 
                         liberal press that the Federal 
                         Wildlife Marshal's Office persecutes 
                         gays.

                                     SHERIFF
                         ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY! THOSE TWO MAY 
                         BE GAY, BUT THAT AIN'T THEIR SON! 
                         THAT'S THE APE!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         You see this badge?  I think I'd 
                         recognize an ape if I saw one. And 
                         the only thing I do recognize here 
                         is a political fiasco I'm, going to 
                         avoid by letting this butt-fucking 
                         Brady Bunch go!

               Jay is whispering to Silent Bob, still vexed by--

                                     JAY
                         And I'll tell you another thing: 
                         what if that guy shows up around the 
                         stores one day and starts telling 
                         everybody you and me are poo-gilists? 
                         How are we gonna get any pussy then, 
                         hunh?

                                     WILLENHOLLY (V.O.)
                         YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE, SIRS!

               Jay and Silent Bob look at each other, shocked. They look 
               back out at Willenholly, who's yards away. Jay points at 
               himself, as if to say, "Me?"

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (via bullhorn)
                         YES, YOU, SIRS.

                                     JAY
                              (calling over)
                         So we can just go?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (via bullhorn)
                         Yes, sir--or ma'am. Please accept my 
                         apologies for detaining you and your 
                         unorthodox-but-constitutionally-
                         protected-family unit.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (amazed)
                         Un-fucking believable.

                                     JAY
                         I'd like to offer a big gay thank-
                         you, sir. We'll tell all our gay 
                         friends that Utah is Gay friendly 
                         country for gays who are gay.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         I'm sure Utah appreciates that. You 
                         might also want to make it clear 
                         that the Federal Wildlife Marshal's 
                         Office is also pro-'mo as well.
                              (winks at the sheriff)
                         And might I add, that's one fine-
                         looking boy you're raising.

                                     JAY
                         Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm. 
                         See, I knocked up a hot woman friend 
                         of ours who I also fuck on the side. 
                         So as not to be all-the-way-gay. But 
                         my tubby husband here is one hundred 
                         percent queer. He loves the cock.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         He certainly looks insatiable.

                                     JAY
                         'Bye

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         'Bye

               Jay, silent Bob and Suzanne head off down the road. 
               Willenholly and all watch them go. The Sheriff is livid.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Well, it's not my way--but damned if 
                         there doesn't go one happy family.
                              (balloon two)
                         Now, we just shoot some tear gas 
                         into that diner, and when the two 
                         guys run out with the monkey, we'll--

               Willenholly suddenly freezes, thinking. He looks to the 
               Sheriff.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         That was the them, wasn't it?

               EXT. ROAD--DAY

               Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne are laughing.

                                     JAY
                         I said you "love the cock"! I gotta 
                         be the craftiest motherfucker alive!

               GUNSHOTS RING OUT, and bullets whiz by the trio, who are now 
               in full panic mode.

               Willenholly and the Cops race after them, firing.

               Jay, Bob and Suzanne race away, ducking bullets.

                                     JAY
                         FLEE, FAT-ASS, FLEE!!!

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               The trio race across what looks like a bridge (but isn't), 
               shots still ringing out. Jay spots a manhole. He points at 
               it, screaming.

                                     JAY
                         HEAD FOR THE SEWERS!

               Silent Bob pops the cover off, With bullets ricocheting all 
               around them, Jay leaps into the manhole.

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL

               Jay lands in a sewer tunnel (like in The Fugitive). Suzanne 
               lands on top of him.

                                     JAY
                         Take your stinking paws off me, you 
                         damn dirty ape!
                              (yelling up)
                         YO LUNCHBOX! HURRY UP!

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               Bullets hitting the pavement around him, Silent bob dives 
               into the sewer grate as well, but--

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL

               Silent Bob gets stuck. Jay rolls his eyes.

                                     JAY
                         You fat fuck.

               Silent Bob struggles while Jay and Suzanne try to pull him 
               through the hole.

                                     JAY
                         You just--had to--order pancakes--
                         didn't ya?

                         ass!

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

               Jay and Suzanne pull with all their might. Bob strains.

                                     JAY
                         SUCK IT IN! THINK THIN! THINK THIN!!!

               EXT. DAM ROAD--SAME

               TIGHT on the Sheriff, as he squints to aim.

                         Open up and say "ahhhhh," you stoner

               The Sheriff's gun fires.

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

               Jay and Suzanne fall backwards, as Silent Bob pops through.

                                     JAY
                         INCOMING!!!

                                     SILENT BOB

                         OOOOOOOOO!!!

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               The bullet ricochets off the curb, as Silent Bob's feet slip 
               through.

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--SAME

               Jay, Silent Bob, and Suzanne are in various states of 
               collapse. Jay and Bob look up at the hole.

                                     JAY
                         Just like Winnie-the-Pooh.

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               Willenholly and the Sheriff arrive at the manhole.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Wow! That was an incredibly daring 
                         escape!
                              (to Sheriff)
                         You must see that a lot, hunh?

                                     SHERIFF
                         Shut up!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Sire, you're very taciturn.

               Willenholly starts rolling up his sleeves as the sheriff 
               looks on.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         You and your men stay up here. When 
                         I corner them, I'll call you for 
                         back-up.

                                     SHERIFF
                         What're you doing? They're trapped. 
                         The only way they can get out of 
                         there is right here.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         A Federal Wildlife Marshal doesn't 
                         wait for his prey to come to him. He 
                         comes to it. Or goes to it. Is it 
                         "comes to it" or "goes to it"?
                              (shakes it off)
                         I'm going in there. I'm counting on 
                         you Sheriff.

               Willenholly embraces the Sheriff.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         You've taught me so much.

               Willenholly then climbs into the sewer, disappearing. The 
               Cops look at the Sheriff for a beat, who heads O.C. saying--

                                     SHERIFF
                         Fuck this asshole. Let's go back to 
                         the station and get some donuts.

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY

               TIGHT on Jay, Bob, and Suzanne, looking into the distance, 
               bathed by natural light. We HEAR the loud sounds of water 
               rushing.

                                     JAY
                         This reminds me of the night I fucked 
                         your mom, yo. One big-wet, smelly, 
                         gaping hole, and me wishing I had a 
                         board tied to my ass--

               PULL BACK to reveal Jay, Silent Bob and Suzanne standing at 
               the precipice of the sewer tunnel that pokes out of a DAM. 
               Water rushed below.

                                     JAY
                         --to keep from falling in.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         PUT THE MONKEY DOWN AND YOUR HANDS 
                         UP!

               Willenholly aims his gun at the trio's backs.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         MISTERS, DO YOU WANNA GET SHOT?!?

               Our heroes comply, but Jay speaks.

                                     JAY
                         LOOK MAN--SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO 
                         BACK! THEY'RE EXPERIMENTING ON HER!
                              (beat)
                         AND FOR THE RECORD, I AIN'T REALLY 
                         GAY!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         I DON'T CARE!
                              (beat)
                         AND FOR THE RECORD, I KNEW THAT WASN'T 
                         REALLY A LITTLE BOY.

                                     JAY
                         SURE, FOR ONE MORE RECORD--
                              (pointing to Silent 
                              Bob)
                         HE LOVES COCK!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         ON YOUR KNEES!

               Jay and Silent Bob face Willenholly and kneel. But Suzanne's 
               still looking out of the dam.

                                     JAY
                         See, man?! He's lining us up like 
                         fucking circus seals! Well, I'm going 
                         first--I don't want no mouthful of 
                         monkey-spit when I gotta blow this 
                         fucking G-Man.

               TIGHT on Suzanne, who's looking down at the raging water 
               below. Her brow hardens with purpose.

               TIGHT on Suzanne's right hand grabbing Jay's right hand.

               TIGHT on Suzanne's left hand grabbing Bob's left hand.

               Suzanne leaps forward at us, pulling Jay and Silent Bob 
               backwards.

                                     JAY
                         GET OFFA ME!!! GET OFFA ME!!!

               EXT. DAM--DAY

               Suzanne leaps from the mouth of the tunnel, dragging Jay and 
               Bob with her.

                                     JAY AND BOB
                         AAAAIIIGGGGGHHHHH!!!

               INT. SEWER TUNNEL--DAY

               Willenholly goes wide-eyed, holstering his gun.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Oh, no--think you can pull a Peter 
                         Pan on me?!

               He races toward the mouth of the tunnel and leaps out as 
               well.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         AAAIIIGGGGHHHHH!!!

               EXT. DAM--DAY

               As Willenholly plummets, he passes Suzanne hanging by her 
               feet off a pipe that pokes out from beneath the mouth of the 
               tunnel. She's hanging upside down, holding Jay and Silent 
               Bob's hands.

                                     JAY
                         HEY LAW-DOG! SEE YOU IN HELL, COCK--
                         SMOKER!!!

               EXT. DAM BOTTOM--DAY

               Willenholly plummets toward the water below and ker-splashes 
               into the drink.

               EXT. DAM--DAY

               Suzanne has pulled Jay and Silent Bob back into the mouth of 
               the tunnel.

                                     JAY
                         You see that shit? Damn--remind me 
                         not to get on the monkey's bad side.  
                         Yo--boost her up. So we can talk, so 
                         we can get the fuck out of here.

               Silent Bob lifts Suzanne over the tunnel onto the--

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               --pavement near the manhole. She sits there, looking down.

               EXT. DAM--DAY

               Silent Bob lifts Jay over the top of the tunnel toward the 
               road,

               EXT. DAM ROAD--DAY

               Suzanne sits by the side of the road. A car pulls into the 
               shot.

               Jay and Silent Bob climb over the cliff onto the highway 
               just in time to see--

               The passenger door slamming on a TRUCK with Los Angeles plates 
               and a sign that reads CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD. Suzanne is 
               looking out the back window waving.  Jay and Bob leap to 
               their feet, chasing after the truck.

                                     JAY
                         HEY! GET THE FUCK OFF HER, MAN! THAT'S 
                         MY EX-GIRLFRIEND'S MONKEY?!

               The truck speeds away in the distance. Jay and Silent Bob 
               stand there, panting.

                                     JAY
                         Man! Who the fuck just steals a 
                         monkey?!

               Silent Bob indicates themselves.

                                     JAY
                         Oh yeah.
                              (pissed)
                         Well this fucking blows! We got one 
                         more day to stop those fucks from 
                         making that movie, and someone goes 
                         and takes the only thing I had left 
                         from the one woman I ever loved enough 
                         NOT to try to stick my hand down her 
                         pants!

               Silent Bob mimes that they should go after Suzanne.

                                     JAY
                         Go after the monkey? How the fuck 
                         are we supposed to know where that 
                         thing's going?

               Silent Bob mimes in the direction the car went. Jay stares 
               at him.

                                     JAY
                         What? What is that supposed to mean?! 
                         Don't just fucking point like--
                              (imitates him)
                         You ain't the broad in the Children 
                         of a Lesser God. Use you fucking 
                         mouth for more than eating, ya tubby 
                         bitch!

               Bob starts an elaborate pantomime. Jay tries to guess what 
               he's saying.

                                     JAY
                         You gotta take a shit? No--you gotta 
                         take a salad? Take a salad? What the 
                         fuck are you trying to say?

               Bob's on the verge of tears, trying to mime out his message.

                                     JAY
                         JUST FUCKING SAY IT ALREADY?!?

               Silent Bob grabs Jay and screams into his face.

                                     SILENT BOB
                         THE SIGN ON THE BACK OF THE CAR SAID 
                         CRITTERS OF HOLLYWOOD, YOU DUMB 
                         FUCK!!!

               Bob releases Jay, breathing heavily and storms off in the 
               direction of the car went. Jay watched him go for a beat, 
               then follows, muttering under his breath--

                                     JAY
                         Say it, don't spray it, bitch.

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD--DAY

               We start on the street sign, and PAN DOWN to a JEEP WRANGLER 
               that pulls up. A gorgeous woman in sunglasses drives, with 
               Silent Bob sitting in the back seat.  After a beat, Jay pops 
               up from under the dash, wiping his mouth, looking around.  
               The Woman sighs, and zips up her pants. Jay and Bob hop out 
               and wave to the Woman as the car pulls away. Bob offers Jay 
               a look.

                                     JAY
                         What? It's not like it's cheating. 
                         Justice blew up.

               Two HOOKERS approach them.

                                     HOOKER 1
                         Hey, little man. You want some of

                                     HOOKER 1
                         If you've got fifty bucks we can get 
                         nasty.

                                     JAY
                         Oh yeah? How nasty?

                                     HOOKER 2
                         As nasty as you wanna be, poppie.

                                     JAY
                         Alright--first, I'll want to tongue 
                         your bung while you juggle my balls 
                         in one hand and play with my asshole 
                         with the other. But don't stick you 
                         finger in.  Then. I'll wanna pinky 
                         you and put it in your friend's brown, 
                         while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie 
                         cup. After that, I'll wanna smell 
                         your titties, for a while, and you 
                         can pull my nutsack up over my dick, 
                         so it looks like a Bullfrog. Then I 
                         want you to flick at my nuts while 
                         your friend spanks me into the same 
                         Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in. Then 
                         we throw the Dixie cup out.

               The Hookers look at him, dumbfounded, Then--

                                     HOOKER 1
                         Oh, that's it honey. I quit.

                         This job just passed the point of no 
                         return.

                                     HOOKER 2
                              (to Jay)
                         You one fucked up puppy, poppie.

                                     JAY
                              (watching them go)
                         What?! You said 'nasty'?
                              (shakes his head; to 
                              Bob)
                         Man, chicks in Hollywood are so stuck 
                         up.

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD.--LATER

               Jay and Silent Bob walk.

                                     JAY
                         Alright, here's the plan: first, we 
                         find out where they're shooting that 
                         movie at. After we shut that shit 
                         down, we can start looking for the 
                         monkey. But before we do any of that 
                         shit, we gotta find a motherfucker 
                         in the know. Someone who's like, the 
                         mayor of Hollywood.

               They pass a DEALER leaning against a wall, trying to make a 
               sale.

                                     DEALER
                              (subtly)

                         ass rock. Get you high.

                                     JAY
                         No man, but you want some weed?

                              (beat)
                         You on the job?

                                     JAY
                              (pulling out a card)
                         Yeah, boy. Jersey Local 408.

               CLOSE ON THE CARD.  It reads: UNITED JERSEY BROTHERHOOD OF 
               DEALERS, LOCAL 408.

               There's a graphic of a stoner beside it.

                                     DEALER
                         I'm Los Angeles Local 305!

               They shake hands, slapping each other on the back like Union 
               brothers.

                                     DEALER

                         gots to get your benefits, you know 
                         what I'm saying?

                                     JAY

                                     DEALER
                         You in this town and you gonna ask 
                         that question? Be a little more 
                         specific.

                                     JAY
                         It's a Miramax flick. We gotta bust 
                         it up so people stop calling us names 
                         on the Internet, even though they're 
                         not really talking about us but these 
                         characters based on us, and at the 
                         same time, find my ex-girlfriend-who-

               Jay exhales. The Dealer stares at him for a beat.

                                     DEALER
                         I don't know that the fuck you just 
                         said, little kid. But you touched a 
                         brother's heart, so I'm gonna help 
                         you out with some directions to the 
                         studio.

                                     JAY
                         You know where Miramax is at?

                                     DEALER
                         Fuck, yes. Miramax accounts for

                                     STEVE
                         But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob?

                                     JULES
                         None whatsoever. However, to be fair, 
                         all the feds have to work with is 
                         murky videotape, so no one's even a 
                         hundred percent sure what Jay and 
                         Silent Bob look like, exactly. For 
                         all we know, they could already be 
                         on the lot.

               As Jules speaks, Jay and Bob walk into the frame behind her, 
               looking up at the studio sign. They then notice the camera 
               and start waving behind Jules.

               INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM--DAY

               Justice goes wide-eyed, seeing Jay and Bob on E! She hops 
               out of her seat.

                                     JUSTICE
                         Oh my God! Jay! No!

               Justice looks around, panicky. Her eyes fall on--

               The diamonds, sitting atop the satchel on the table.

               Justice looks at the diamonds, then the TV screen. She thinks 
               for a beat, then--

                                     JUSTICE
                         Fuck it.

               She pours the diamonds into the satchel, and shoves it in 
               her pocket.

               INT. SEEDY MOTEL BEDROOM--DAY

               The door slowly opens in the dark bedroom, and Justice crawls 
               to the bedside table, reaching for a set of keys. In the 
               bed, Missy and Chrissy make out under the sheets, moaning. 
               Sissy's banging the Pizza Delivery Guy against the vanity.  
               Justice grabs the keys, leaving a note in their place. As 
               she crawls back out, we PUSH IN on the note, which reads: 
               SORRY, GUYS--BUT I LOVE HIM.

               EXT. SEEDY MOTEL PARKING LOT--DAY

               The convertible skids out, taking off.

               INT. SEEDY MOTEL HALLWAY--DAY

               There's a loud scream, then Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy rush 
               down the stairs (in varied states of undress and sheet-wrap). 
               Wiping their mouths. Sissy holds Justices's note.

                                     SISSY
                         That bitch!  That fucking, fucking 
                         bitch!!!
                              (to girls)
                         Get dressed. We're going after her.

                                     CHRISSY
                         Fuck that, I didn't get to cum yet.

                                     SISSY
                         Which is more important to you: a 
                         fortune in diamonds or busting a 
                         nut?

               Sissy and Missy race back up the stairs. Chrissy stands there 
               still, shrugs, then digs her hand into her panties.

                                     SISSY (O.S.)
                         Chrissy! Now!

                                     CHRISSY
                         Fuck--

               Chrissy races back up the stairs.

               EXT. MIRAMAX STUDIOS-DAY

               The E! NEWS CREW packs up. Jay and Silent Bob study the main 
               gate. They watch the SECURITY GUARD approach a car that's 
               just pulled up. The Guard checks the driver's pass, then 
               lifts the gate to let the car through. Jay looks to Bob.

                                     JAY
                         We gotta play this right.

               Bob nods, After a beat, the pair tear-ass past the guard 
               booth. The GUARD leaps out of the booth, blowing a whistle 
               and giving chase.

               EXT. STUDIO LOT--DAY

               Jay and Bob race around the building toward what looks like 
               an open alley then smash into it, falling down. The open 
               alley is a background painting that's being moved by some 
               SCENICS. Jay and Bob get up, shaking off the impact.

                                     JAY
                         I hate how fake Hollywood is.

               The SECURITY GUARD catches up to them now, grabbing them by 
               their shoulders, spinning them around.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Where do you think you're going?

                                     JAY
                         GET OFFA ME! RAAAAAPE!!!

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         This is L.A., sir. We don't rape our 
                         suspects in custody. We just beat 
                         them.

                         I thought that was a ten-eighty-two.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         No, sir--a ten-eight-two is the code 
                         for vanishing a dead hooker from Ben 
                         Affleck's trailer.

                              (from walkie-talkie)
                         Oh, that Affleck. Backup on the way.

                                     JAY
                         Hey! I make you a deal: this guy'll 
                         suck your dick off if you let us go!

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Contrary to what you believe, not 
                         everyone in the movie business is 
                         gay.

                                     JAY
                         Well, how about this deal: he sucks 
                         my dick while you watch and jerk 
                         off.

               The Security Guard stops, looks around, then releases them, 
               reaching into his pants.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Alright. But make is fast. And sexy.

               Silent Bob looks at Jay, wide-eyed and scared.

                                     JAY
                         Dude, it's either this or jail. And 
                         you know what they make you do in 
                         jail.

               Silent Bob wells up with tears, slowly dropping to his knees, 
               reaching for Jay's pants. The Security guard bends down low 
               to watch at crotch-level. Suddenly, Jay hammers his two fists 
               into the Security Guard's neck, knocking him out.  Silent 
               Bob falls into a sitting position on the ground, relieved. 
               Jay looks at him.

                                     JAY
                         Well what are you waiting for, bitch? 
                         Start sucking. Bunnggg!
                              (looking around)
                         Alright--where they shooting this 
                         movie at?

               Silent Bob points behind Jay, at the SOUNDSTAGE they're in 
               front of. There's a LINE OF PEOPLE waiting at the door.

                                     JAY
                         Worth a shot. Like a shot in the 
                         mouth, you gay bitch. Eww, dude--you 
                         were really gonna suck my dick.

               Silent Bob shakes his head "no," wide-eyed as Jay heads off. 
               When Jay's out of frame, Silent bob shrugs like, "Yeah--I 
               guess I was."

               EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

               Jay and Bob approach the line, as an A.D. calls out to the 
               crowd.

                                     A.D.
                         Alright--bar extras. Follow me.

               The A.D. starts leading the crowd in. Jay and Bob blend in 
               and follow inside.

               Two other AGENTS rush in, chuckling. All gather around the

               BEGIN CROSS-CUTTING WITH WILLENHOLLY.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Sid? Hey, buddy. I'm calling because 
                         I could really use your help on this

                         I'll bet, Will. What's it this time... 
                         Beaver trouble? Some kind of 
                         unauthorized marsupial trafficking?

               The agents crack up, stifling their laughter.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (taking it in stride)
                         No, no--nothing like that. Say--there 
                         aren't other people listening in, 
                         are there?

                                     AGENT SID
                         No way, man. It's just me and you 
                         talking here.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Good. I'm tracking a monkey down 
                         that's on it's way to Los Angeles, 
                         and I could use some bureau backup.

                                     AGENT SID
                         Los Angeles, hunh? Maybe we should 
                         stake out Clint Eastwood's place. 
                         Didn't he used to drive around with 
                         a monkey that'd punch people and 
                         drink beer?

               The Agents crack up. Willenholly's catching on.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Am, uh--Am I on speaker phone?

                                     AGENT SID
                         No way--Dunston!

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Alright, now that's not fair. I know 
                         I didn't make it as high up as you 
                         guys, but my job's just as important.

                                     AGENT SID
                         Calm down, Will. Don't go all... 
                         bananas on us!

               The Agents crack up even more, Willenholly's pissed.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         I come to you as a friend--as a fellow 
                         professional--and this is the shit I 
                         get?!

                                     AGENT SID
                         You're right, Will. Tell you what--
                         we'll get our best man on your case 
                         right away. You might've heard of 
                         him. He's a doctor.

                              (excited)
                         Oh, a doctor?

                                     AGENT SID
                         His name's Doctor Zaius!

               The Agents laugh hysterically, pounding the desk, Willenholly 
               tears up, enraged.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         SCREW YOU GUYS!

               Willenholly throws his cell phone across the car, the mocking 
               laughter still emitting from it. Willenholly cries.

                         Where are we taking it from, Gus?

               Gus Van Sant sits off to the side, counting a stack of money. 
               He just shrugs.

                                     GUS
                         I'm busy.

                                     BEN
                         You're a true artist, Gus

                                     MATT
                         Just take it from "It's a good 
                         course."

                                     BEN
                         Oh, now you're the director.

                                     MATT
                         Hey, shove it. Bounce-boy. Let's 
                         remember who talked who into doing 
                         this shit in the first place. Talking 
                         me into Dogma was one thing, but 
                         this--

                                     BEN
                         I'm sorry this is taking you away 
                         from whatever-gay-killers-on-horses-
                         who-like-to-play-golf-touchy-feely-
                         flick you're supposed to be doing 
                         this week.

                                     MATT
                         Oh--I'm touchy-feely? I take it you 
                         never saw Forces of Nature?

                                     BEN
                         You're like a child. What've I been 
                         telling you? Sometimes you've gotta 
                         do the safe picture. Sometimes, you 
                         do it for art. Sometimes, it's the 
                         payback picture your friend says you 
                         owe him--

               They take a beat and look at the camera. Then--

                                     BEN
                         And sometimes, you go back to the 
                         well.

                                     MATT
                         And sometimes, you do Reindeer Games.

                                     BEN
                         Now that's just mean.

               Jay turns excitedly to Bob.

                                     JAY
                         This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick, 
                         'cause that's those two fucks from 
                         that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do 
                         is figure out a way to get close to 
                         them--

               The A.D. grabs Jay and Bob by the arms and drags them onto 
               the set, placing them near Ben and Matt in the scene.

                                     A.D.
                         Just stand there and react. Don't 
                         say anything.

               Bob goes a little wide-eyed. Jay smiles at him.

                                     JAY
                              (off A.D.'s comment)
                         That's pretty funny.

                                     A.D.
                              (calling out)
                         Alright, people. Lock it up. Let's 
                         go for picture.

               Jay and Bob eye Ben and Matt fiercely, Ben and Matt are 
               oblivious.

                                     JAY
                         On the count of three, we rush those 
                         fucks and beat the shit out of 'em. 
                         'Cause if they're all fucked up, 
                         they can't make the move, right? 
                         Alright, then.  One--two--

                                     CLAPPER/LOADER (O.S.)
                         Good Will Hunting Two: Hunting Season.

               Jay and Bob freeze and look at each other, then O.C.

               The Clapper/Loader holds a clapboard in front of Ben's face. 
               It does indeed, read: Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season.

                                     CLAPPER/LOADER
                         Scene sixteen, take five.

               The Clapper/Loader claps the board closed and races off. Ben 
               looks to Gus.

                                     BEN
                         Action, Gus?

               Gus looks up from counting his money.

                                     GUS
                         Jesus, Ben--I said I'm busy.

               Ben shakes his head and then starts the scene with CLARK.

                                     BEN/CHUCKIE
                         You should check it out, it's a good 
                         course. But, you know, frankly, I 
                         found the class rather elementary.

                                     CLARK
                         You know, I don't doubt that it was. 
                         I remember that class. It was just 
                         between recess and lunch.

                                     BEN/CHUCKIE
                         Are we gonna have a problem, again?

                                     CLARK
                         There's no problem. I was still just 
                         hoping you might give me some insight 
                         into the evolution of the market 
                         economy in the Southern Colonies. 
                         See, Wood says--

                                     MATT/WILL
                              (stepping in)
                         What'd I say? Didn't I say you'd be 
                         back here regurgitating Gordon Wood. 
                         But you forgot about Vickers--

                                     CLARK
                         No, I just read Vickers, so I'm up 
                         on inherited wealth, Hunting. But 
                         you're not the angry, brilliant young 
                         mind you once were, just itching to 
                         vent your frustrations.

               In the background, Jay and Silent Bob get bored and head out 
               of the shot. After a beat, they get pushed back in by the 
               A.D.

                                     CLARK
                         Once Sean told you it wasn't your 
                         fault, you lost the edge, William.  
                         You stopped hitting the books with a 
                         vengeance, and now I've read shit 
                         you haven't even heard about yet. 
                         Face facts, my friend--love made you 
                         a soft little pussy boy, unable to 
                         stand up to an academic showdown, 
                         like you used to. You're just no 
                         longer that good--Will Hunting.
                              (gets in his face)
                         Now how do you like them apples?

               Matt/Will turns away angrily, facing Ben/Chuckie, looking 
               downwards, steaming.

                                     BEN/CHUCKIE
                         I don't like the sound of them apples. 
                         Will, what're we gonna do now?

                                     MATT/WILL
                         Chuckie--
                              (snarling)
                         It's Hunting season.

               Matt/Will spins to face Clark with two huge guns in his hands. 
               He blows Clark away, Jay and Bob hit the deck. Matt/Will 
               stands there, guns smoking.

                                     BEN/CHUCKIE
                         Apple sauce, bitch.

               Suddenly the door to the soundstage swings open, and the 
               Security guard Jay knocked out rushes in, followed by other 
               SECURITY GUARDS who comb the place.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Sorry to interrupt, sirs, but have a 
                         ten-oh-seven on our hands.

                                     BEN
                         Wait a second! I wasn't with any 
                         hookers today!

               The Security Guard sees Jay and Bob crouched behind Ben, He 
               points, screaming.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         THERE THEY ARE!

               Ben and Matt turn to Jay and Bob, Jay smiles.

                                     JAY
                         Affleck, you're the bomb in Phantoms, 
                         yo.

               Jay and Bob then race out-of-frame, closely followed by the 
               Security guards.  Matt head off, arms thrown in the air.

                                     MATT
                         If anyone's looking for me, I'll be 
                         in my trailer trying to figure out 
                         how I got here from an Academy Award.

               EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

               Jay and Bob rush out, pulling a bench in front of the door, 
               blocking it. They race ten feet to another soundstage across 
               from them and head inside a door.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

               Jay and Silent Bob rush in to see--

               Wes Craven getting ready to direct a scene with a familiar-
               looking GHOSTFACE KILLER and SHANNEN DOHERTY. The 
               Clapper/Loader's clapboard reads: Scream 4

                                     CLAPPER/LOADER
                         Scream four, scene thirty-seven, 
                         take one.
                              (claps it and rushes 
                              off)

                                     WES CRAVEN
                         Action!

               The Killer chases Shannen around the room, falling over stuff, 
               until she hits him with a lamp, knocking him out.

                                     SHANNEN DOHERTY
                         Alright, you bastard! Let's see who 
                         you really are!

               Shannen pulls the mask off the short performer to reveal 
               SUZANNE.

               Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed.

                                     SHANNEN DOHERTY
                         Fucking Miramax--
                              (getting up)
                         CUT!

               Shannen heads over to Wes, holding the mask.

                                     WES CRAVEN
                         Shannen, usually I say "cut."

                                     SHANNEN DOHERTY
                         A monkey? Jesus, you guys aren't 
                         even trying anymore, are you?

                                     WES CRAVEN
                         The market research suggest that 
                         people love monkeys.

               Jay and Silent Bob rush in, grab Suzanne.

                                     JAY
                         WE LOVE THIS MONKEY!

               They rush out. West shrugs to Shannen.

                                     WES CRAVEN
                         See?

               Security Guards race through, chasing after the exited pair.

               EXT. LOT--DAY

               Jay and Bob race through the lot, with Bob carrying Suzanne. 
               On a fake New York city street, another movie is shooting. 
               The trio, bob and weave through the shoot, until--

               At the end of the alley, a set GOLF CART pulls up, and four 
               Security Guards pile out, forming a human wall, blocking 
               their path. Jay and Bob stop dead, looking back to see the 
               other Security Guards gaining.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are we gonna do?

               Just then, a P.A. on a bike pulls up nearby. He ditches the 
               bike and grabs papers from the large hanging basket in front.

               Jay and Bob look at each other, race over to the bike, and 
               jump on, putting Suzanne in the basket. They start pedaling 
               away furiously, closely followed by the Security Guard posse. 
               Silent Bob peddles like mad, racing toward the Golf Cart.

                                     JAY
                         PUNCH IT!!!

               Bob pops a wheelie and the Bike races up the front of the 
               vehicle, taking flight,

               Below, the Security Guards stare in awe as--

               Jay and Silent Bob atop the bike--with Suzanne in the front 
               basket--go past a moon (on a billboard, on the side of a 
               soundstage) a la E.T.

               Jay and Bob look down, then at each other. They smile. Then 
               they look ahead and let out a scream.

               The bike crashes through a window in the side of a Soundstage 
               Building.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY

               The Bike lands, and Jay and Bob, and Suzanne go tumbling 
               onto the floor covered in glass. They look up to see.

               JAMES VAN DER BEEK AND JASON BIGGS dressed as Jay and Silent 
               Bob, looking down as them.

                                     JAMES
                         Holy shit--that looked like it hurt.

                                     JASON
                         Are you guys alright?
                              (off Suzanne)
                         Hey! They've got a monkey!

               Jay and Bob look at their twins, then at each other.

                                     JAY
                         Yo, I think that shit just kicked 
                         in.

                                     JAMES
                         Let's get you guys on your feet.

               James and Jason help Jay and Silent Bob to their feet. All 
               stare at one another, perplexed,

               Then--

                                     JAY
                              (to James)
                         See man?  Its never, "Hey--you were 
                         in Loser, or, "Dude--you rocked in 
                         Boys and Girls." It always comes 
                         back to that fucking pie! I'm haunted 
                         by it.!

                                     JAMES
                         Well, you put your dick in a pie, 
                         dude--

                                     JASON
                         Enough!
                              (to Jay)
                         Jason Biggs.

                                     JAY
                         Yo-you really get to third base with 
                         the Russsian chick like you did in 
                         the movies?

                                     JASON
                         You mean Shannon? Sadly, no.

                                     JAY
                         She's fucking hot, man. If I was 
                         you, I'd been like--

               Jay mimes a series of sexual maneuvers. Jason and James look 
               on, bewildered.

                                     JAY
                              (off James's-look)
                         What, man? You never did one of these?

               Jay starts miming again, and suddenly stops, staring at James, 
               blown away.

                                     JAY
                         Holy shit? You're the Dawson!

                                     JAMES
                         It's James, actually. James Van Der 
                         Beek.

                                     JAY
                         Yo, what's up with Pacey stealing 
                         Joey away from you? If I was you, I 
                         would've drowned his ass in your 
                         Creek and shit!

                                     JAMES
                         I know, Because what--is Josh better 
                         looking than me? Fuck, no. I mean, 
                         who on earth is better looking that 
                         me? I ask you.

                                     JAY
                         Joey, man! She's too fine! Yo--did 
                         you ever get to third base with her?

                                     JAMES
                         Well, there was this one time--
                              (catching himself)
                         Wait a second--who are you guys?!

                                     JASON
                         They're our stunt doubles, dumbass.
                              (to Jay)
                         Right?

                                     JAY
                         Stunt doubles for what?

                                     JAMES
                         The movie we start shooting in a few 
                         minutes--Bluntman and Chronic Strike 
                         Back.

                                     JASON
                              (to Bob)
                         You're doubling me. I'm playing 
                         Bluntman, AKA Silent Bill.

                                     JAMES
                         Bob

                                     JASON
                         Right. And he's playing Chronic. AKA 
                         Ray.

                                     JAMES
                         Jay! Shit, did you even read the 
                         script?

                                     JASON
                         There's a script?

               Jay and Bob stare at them, blankly. Then Jay puts up his 
               finger, indicating they should wait a minute. He gets into a 
               huddle with Silent Bob and Suzanne.

                                     JAY
                         These are the guys who are playing 
                         us, yo. We take them out, and bickety-
                         bam! No movie.

               Silent Bob nods at Jay, then Suzanne. Suzanne heads off, 
               leaving Jay and Bob to huddle.

                                     JASON
                              (off Jay and Bob, to 
                              James)
                         What's with the weird, gay huddle 
                         going on over there?

                                     JAMES
                         What's gay about it? It's two guys 
                         talking in a corner. Man--why are 
                         you such a homophobe.

                                     JASON
                         I'm not a homophobe.

                                     JAMES
                         You are. You're always calling things 
                         gay. "Ooo--look at the gay huddle, 
                         dude!"

               Suzanne approaches them.

                                     JASON
                         Hey--look at the monkey.

                                     JAMES
                         Next you're going to tell me the 
                         monkey's gay.

                                     JASON
                         He's so cute--
                              (to Suzanne)
                         C'mere. Monkey. C'mere--

               Suzanne pulls Jason and James out of the frame.

               While Jay and Silent Bob continue to huddle, the sounds of a 
               beating are heard, O.C.

                                     JAY
                         Alright, here's what we do: start 
                         swinging, and don't stop until those 
                         young Hollywood fucks are out of 
                         commission. Ready? Break!

               Jay and Bob spin to face Jason and James--only to go wide-
               eyed. Suzanne stands atop the fallen actors, who are bloodied 
               and beaten and knocked out cold. She holds her hands skyward, 
               clasped like a champion.

                                     JAY
                         That's one funky monkey.

               Suddenly there's a banging at the door of the dressing room.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Mister Biggs?  Mister Van... Der--
                         Beek? This is Security. We've got a 
                         pair of intruders at large, and they 
                         crashed through a window we thought 
                         might be yours.

                                     JAY
                              (to door; deepening 
                              voice)
                         Uh--yeah. They're in here.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Do they have you hostage? Should we 
                         call your publicists?

                                     JAY
                         NO! I mean, we kicked those guys' 
                         asses bad. They're--knocked out.

               EXT. DRESSING ROOM--SAME

               The Security Guards stand outside a door marked James.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Great work, sirs! If you let us in, 
                         we'll take over--

                                     JAY (O.S.)
                              (through door)
                         NO! Me and Jason Biggs are naked in 
                         here! Together!

               The Security guard look at one another.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Uh--okay. We'll just be--outside the 
                         door, sirs.

               The Security Guards stifle a laugh, as one makes a blow job 
               face to the rest.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM--DAY

               Bob opens an AIR VENT in the wall. He puts Suzanne into it 
               and hands her the tranquilizer gun, miming to her. She nods, 
               and starts crawling through the ductwork, Bob closes the 
               vent again, and starts rifling through a nearby closet.

                                     JAY
                         What the fuck are we gonna do?! How 
                         are we gonna get out of here without 
                         them seeing us?

               Silent Bob pulls a pair of hangered COSTUMES from the closet, 
               smiling.

               EXT. LOT--DAY

               The Security Guards push a cuffed Jason and James into a 
               waiting Cop Car. The pair are still dressed like Jay and 
               Silent Bob.

                                     JAMES
                         YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUYS!

                                     JASON
                         HEY! DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?! I'M 
                         THE PIE-FUCKER.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                              (to Cops)
                         He'll be the pie--in prison.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE HALLWAY--DAY

               Jay and Bob creep toward a door (we don't see the outfits).

                                     JAY
                         This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In 
                         these outfits we're totally incognito.

               Suddenly, and A.D. appears, grabbing them by the shoulders.

                                     A.D.
                         Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? 
                         Great--you've changed costumes 
                         already. Let's get you to set.
                              (pulling them off)
                         The director doesn't like to be kept 
                         waiting.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE--BLUNTCAVE SET

               It looks like the Batcave, but it's not. Off to the side, 
               near the monitor and chair setup, a black DIRECTOR eyeballs 
               the hustling, white crew.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Look at all these crackers, Seventy 
                         million dollars and I can't even get 
                         a black grip?

               A white P.A. brings a cup of latte to the Director.

                                     P.A.
                         Here's your coffee, sir.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (eyes the coffee)
                         You spit in this?  Because I know 
                         all you white folks are pissed off 
                         that the studio'd entrust a multi-
                         million dollar to a brother.

                                     P.A.
                         I didn't spit in it, sir.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Then taste it! Go on!

               The P.A. takes the cup and sips from it. He tries to hand it 
               back to the Director.

                                     P.A.
                         It's all good, sir.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         No it ain't all good. Oh, you think 
                         I want it now, after your lips touched 
                         the cup? Get the fuck off my set!

                                     P.A.
                         You the man, sir.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         No you the Man! And that's the 
                         problem!

               The Director glares at the scared P.A., as he cautiously 
               skulks off. BANKY EDWARDS approaches.

                                     BANKY
                         Uh, Chaka? Yeah, hi--I'm Banky 
                         Edwards, the creator of Bluntman and 
                         Chronic. We met a few weeks back. 
                         I'm the executive producer.

                                     DIRECTOR/CHAKA
                         Oh--you're the executive producer, 
                         hunh? Well go "produce" me a latte 
                         no white folks spit in--okay Fucky?

                                     BANKY
                         Banky. I just wanted you to know 
                         that I respect your work as an artist. 
                         I'm something of an artist myself. I 
                         was the inker on the comic book.

                                     CHAKA
                         An inker? What, like you trace?

               Banky's face drops as the A.D. joins them.

                                     A.D.
                         Biggs and Van Der Beek are on the 
                         set, Chaka.

                                     CHAKA
                         I don't see 'em. Where are they?
                              (into bullhorn)
                         WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE STARS OF THIS 
                         PIECE OF SHIT?!

               On the Bluntcave set, two massive doors open in the fake 
               rock. Smoke pours in, and Jay and Silent Bob--now dressed as 
               BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC--step from the darkness. Jay and Bob 
               survey the set, amazed.

                                     JAY
                         This must've set 'em back a couple 
                         hundred bucks.

                                     CHAKA
                         Look at this shit.
                              (off their outfits)
                         A gay hood ornament, and the color 
                         Purple.

                                     JAY
                         Who the fuck are you?

                                     CHAKA
                         Who the fuck am I? I'm the fucking 
                         director, is who I am. Chaka Luther 
                         King. The creator of all of this.

                                     JAY
                         Wait a sec--I thought Holden and 
                         Banky created this shit.

                                     CHAKA
                         And I'm stealing it. I'm taking it 
                         back for all the shit you people 
                         have stolen from us! Did you know, I 
                         came up with the idea for Sesame 
                         Street before PBS? I was going to 
                         call it N.W.P.--Niggaz with Puppets.
                              (beat)
                         Alright--enough small talk. Let's 
                         shoot it.

               Chaka heads back toward his monitor. Jay and Bob are confused.

                                     JAY
                         Wait, wait, wait!! Aren't you gonna 
                         direct us?

                                     CHAKA
                         I'll be directing you to the food 
                         stamps line after I fire your ass, 
                         if you talk back like that to me 
                         again!

                                     JAY
                         But we don't know what we're supposed 
                         to do here. We didn't even read the 
                         script.

                                     CHAKA
                         So? Neither did I. Shit, neither did 
                         the studio.
                              (pointing O.C.)
                         Look man, it's not hard. In this 
                         scene, the bad guy breaks into the 
                         Bluntcave.  You make up some shit, 
                         fight him for a while, I film it, I 
                         yell "cut," and then head back to my 
                         trailer, where I got more white women 
                         waiting for me there than the first 
                         lifeboat off the Titanic!
                              (confidentially)
                         They all want a part of the movie, 
                         and I got just the part for 'em.

               Jay and Silent Bob go wide-eyed, as Chaka heads off.

                                     CHAKA
                         LET'S ROLL WITH THE NEW!

                                     A.D. (O.S.)
                         QUIET ON THE SET! THIS IS A TAKE!

               Chaka climbs behind his monitor. The P.A. is waiting for him 
               with another cup of coffee.

                                     P.A.
                         I got you another cup of coffee, 
                         sir. Spit free.

               Chaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down.

               The Clapper/Loader jumps in front of the startled Jay and 
               Bob, getting ready.  After a beat, he turns to Silent Bob.

                                     CLAPPER/LOADER
                         I just wanna say that I loved when 
                         you fucked that pie.
                              (calling off)
                         BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC STRIKE BACK, 
                         SCENE THIRTY-SEVEN, TAKE ONE!

               The clapper/Loader shuts the clapboard and races off. From 
               behind the monitor,

               Chaka calls out--

                                     CHAKA
                         ACTION!

               Jay and Bob (as Bluntman and Chronic) look at each other for 
               a beat. Then--

                                     JAY/CHRONIC
                         Uh--Snootchie Bootchies.

               Suddenly, the wall to their left explodes. Jay and Bob hit 
               the deck. Through the smoking rubble steps COCK-KNOCKER--the 
               arch--nemesis of Bluntman and Chronic.  He's a normal-looking 
               man with huge, overgrown FISTS.

                                     JAY/CHRONIC
                         What the fuck?

                                     COCK-KNOCKER
                         You thought I'd never find your 
                         precious Bluntcave, did you, Hemp 
                         Knight? But now you and your sidekick 
                         are finally in the grasp of Cock-
                         Knocker!

                                     JAY/CHRONIC
                         Why do they call you "Cock-Knocker"?

               Cock-Knocker slams one of his huge fists into Jay's balls. 
               Jay drops to his knees, wailing. Cock-Knocker then pulls a 
               vibrator-looking device from his cape.  He presses a button 
               on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a 
               light saber.

                                     COCK-KNOCKER
                         Any last words before I bust your 
                         balls, Bluntman?

               Silent Bob quickly looks right, then left. His eyes fall on--

               A wall of armaments, on which hands a SILVER BONG, under the 
               placard: BONG SABER--EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL. DO NOT USE. 
               It's out of his reach.

               Silent Bob closes his eyes, concentrating. He reached his 
               hand out to the Bong Saber, attempting the Jedi Mind Trick.

               Suddenly, the Bong snaps from the armory into Bob's grip. 
               The Bong Saber blasts to life and Bob strikes a defensive 
               pose. Bob rushes the astonished Cock-Knocker and the pair 
               start light saber dueling.

                                     CHAKA
                              (from behind monitor)
                         Damn! Now that was one special effect! 
                         This picture's gonna make House Party 
                         look like House Party Two!

                                     A.D.
                         Or House Party Three?

                                     CHAKA
                         Shut the fuck up!

               Cock-Knocker battles Bob back. He vogues some impressive 
               blade handling, prompting Bob to make a run for it--up the 
               ladder of the Bong Reactor and over Cock-Knocker's head. He 
               lands behind Cock-Knocker, striking another pose.  Cock-
               Knocker then high- kicks Bob in the face, knocking him on 
               his ass across the floor. Cock-Knocker rushers over to deliver 
               a saber kill-shot, when we hear--

                                     JAY (O.S.)
                         YO-BITCH-FISTS!

               Cock-Knocker turns to see--

               Jay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a 
               double-sided saber. He clicks it and TWO beams emit (a la 
               the Darth Maul light saber in Episode One).

                                     JAY
                         Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg.

               Jay leaps at Cock-Knocker, wielding the double-beamed Bong 
               Saber.

                                     CHAKA
                              (from behind the 
                              monitor)
                         I think George Lucas is going to sue 
                         somebody--

               EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

               Willenholly's car screeches up, and Willenholly jumps with a 
               shotgun. He slides across the hood of the car and lands beside 
               the flashing red light.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (looking around)
                         So, this is Hollywood?
                              (suddenly full of 
                              purpose)
                         Lights, camera, action, Jay and Silent 
                         Bob.

               Willenholly cocks his shotgun and heads for the door.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE--DAY

               The door bursts open, and Willenholly charges in, firing two 
               shots, O.C.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         FREEZE YOU TERRORIST SONSABITCHES!!!

               Willenholly goes wide-eyed.

               It's not Bluntcave. We're on a different soundstage, where a 
               kid's movie's being shot: Mooby's Grand Adventure. There's a 
               Barney-sized MOOBY surrounded by little KIDS. The Kids stare 
               back at Willenholly terrified. The Mooby suit has smoking 
               bullet holes in it. Mooby collapses.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Oh my God--
                              (to kids)
                         Um--sorry. That was supposed to be a 
                         warning shot. Uh--it looks like I'm 
                         on the wrong, uh--wrong set.

               The Kids look at the fallen Mooby. On looks angrily at the 
               O.C. Willenholly.

                                     KID
                         You killed Mooby--
                              (to Kids)
                         LET'S GET HIM!!!

               The Kids charge Willenholly, who screams like a woman as 
               he's attacked.

               INT. SOUNDSTAGE--SAME

               Jay attacks Cock-Knocker with his Bong Saber, full throttle.

                                     COCK-KNOCKER
                              (breaking character)
                         You are not upstaging me, Van Der 
                         Beek!

               Jay whacks away happily at the actor playing Cock-Knocker, 
               hacking him up onto the ladder of the Bluntcave's nuclear 
               reactor. Cock-Knocker climbs the ladder slightly to evade 
               the attack, dueling Jay back with the saber in his other 
               hand.

                                     COCK-KNOCKER
                              (to O.C. Chaka)
                         CHAKA--CALL OFF DAWSON! GIVE ME A 
                         "CUT"!

               On cue, Jay delivers a kill-shot to one of Cock-Knocker's 
               huge fists, cutting it off (a la Empire).

               Silent Bob joins Jay, as Jay turns off this double-Bong Saber, 
               Jay grins at Cock-Knocker.

                                     JAY
                         Now whose balls have been busted, 
                         bitch?

               Suddenly, a gun shot rings out.

               All turn to see a roughed-up Willenholly, training his gun 
               first on Jay, then Bob.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         The C.L.I.T. stops here, Jay and 
                         Silent Bob!
                              (revealing badge: 
                              calling out)
                         Everyone stay calm. I'm a Federal 
                         Wildlife Marshal. These men are the 
                         leaders of a terrorist organization 
                         wanted for the abduction of a monkey.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         They didn't really steal that monkey.

               All turn to see Justice approaching from the shadows. 
               Willenholly trains his gun on her. Jay's mouth drops.

                                     JUSTICE
                         It was just a diversion so we could 
                         steal these.

               Justice pulls the bag of diamonds from her jacket, revealing 
               them.

                                     JUSTICE
                         And they're not the leaders of 
                         C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         No--the clit's real. The female orgasm 
                         is a myth.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (to Jay)
                         Are you guys alright?

                                     JAY
                         I thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty 
                         Fuck.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (smiling)
                         You remembered.
                              (back to business)
                         It was a frame-up, Jay. Sissy. Missy, 
                         Chrissy, and I are international 
                         jewel thieves. We were setting you 
                         up as a patsy, but I couldn't go 
                         through with it, because I... because 
                         I love you.

                                     JAY
                         Yeah? So that means you'll fuck me, 
                         right?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         If she does, it'll be considered 
                         necrophilia.

               All turn to see Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy slinking from the 
               shadows, guns drawn.

                                     SISSY
                         Because she's gonna be one dead bitch.
                              (to Justice)
                         Hi, Jussy. We catch you at a bad 
                         time?

                                     MISSY
                         You should've just let these guys go 
                         down, Jussy.

                                     JAY
                         Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was 
                         waiting until I got to know her a 
                         little better. See, there was this 
                         little angel on my shoulder, and he 
                         said--

                                     CHRISSY
                         Shut the fuck up before I shoot you 
                         where you stand in your pansy red 
                         booties.

                                     JAY
                              (looking down)
                         Holy shit, I am wearing pansy red 
                         booties!
                              (to Bob)
                         Man--why the fuck didn't you tell 
                         me?

                                     SISSY
                         Let's have those diamonds, Jussy.

                                     JUSTICE
                         I can't do that, Sissy

                                     SISSY
                              (points her gun at 
                              Jay)
                         Then lover--boy gets one in the brain.

                                     CHAKA
                         YO!

               All turn to look at Chaka.

                                     CHAKA
                         Would any of you lovely ladies like 
                         a private audition to be in my movie?

               Justice high-kicks the gun out of Sissy's hand. It lands on 
               the ground discharging. Then everyone starts shooting and 
               running for cover.

               Jay and Silent Bob hurl themselves over the Bluntmobile.

               Missy and Chrissy flip over a lavish, exquisitely-packed 
               craft service table labeled. CAST. They pop back up and start 
               firing at Willenholly. Willenholly leaps behind a barren 
               craft service table that holds a bag of Smarties and a dented 
               can of RC Cola. He pops up and returns fire. When both are 
               out of bullets, they drop back down behind the table and 
               reload. From behind his table,

               Willenholly yells--

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         WHY ARE YOU SHOOTING AT ME?!?! I'M 
                         JUST A FEDERAL WILDLIFE MARSHAL!!!

                                     CHRISSY
                         TWO REASONS: ONE--WE'RE WALKING, 
                         TALKING BAD GIRLS, CLICHES!

                                     MISSY
                         AND TWO: BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         ONLY ON THE OUTSIDE!

               The Girls and Willenholly both pop back up and open fire 
               again.

               Chaka ducks behind the monitor.

                                     CHAKA
                         A shitload of white people with guns? 
                         Time to get my black ass out of here!

               He races off, passing Justice and Sissy, who circle each 
               other defensively, striking kung fu poses.

                                     SISSY
                         You really let me down, Justice. 
                         Throwing it all away for a little 
                         stoner with bad pronunciation.

                                     JAY (O.S.)
                         HEY!

                                     JUSTICE
                              (ignoring him)
                         What's it gonna be, Sissy? Which 
                         fighting style do you want me to 
                         kick your ass in?

                                     SISSY
                         Are you kidding me? I taught you all 
                         all your moves myself. There's not a 
                         style you can bust that I can't defend 
                         against.

                                     JUSTICE
                         You're no match for my "Shaolin Monk."

                                     SISSY
                         Yeah, but I can bury you with my 
                         "Crouching Tiger."

                                     JUSTICE
                         A little "Venus's--flytrap"?

                                     SISSY
                         I'll counter with "Dragon Crane."

                                     JUSTICE
                         How about a little "Bitch, My Man 
                         Ain't Yo Baby's Daddy"?

                                     SISSY
                              (beat; smiles)
                         Bring it on.

               Justice rushes Sissy and instead of sleek kung fu, they launch 
               into a down-and-dirty, girl's cat-fight; hair pulling and 
               screaming.

               Behind the Bluntmobile, Jay and Bob watch all the action.

                                     JAY
                         Yo--I hope one of 'em rips the other 
                         one's shirt off and we see some tit.

               Both Bob and Jay smile at each other, nodding. Banky joins 
               them, crawling in on his belly, covering his head.

                                     BANKY
                         Mister Biggs? Mister Van Der Beek? I 
                         just wanted to say hi. I'm--

                                     JAY
                         Banky fucking Edwards! Just the 
                         motherfucker we came to see!

                                     BANKY
                              (shocked)
                         Holy shit! What the fuck are you 
                         guys doing here?!

               Sissy has Justice on her belly, banging her face into the 
               floor, screeching.  Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.

                                     BANKY
                         Stop the movie?! Are you crazy?!

                                     JAY
                         All these assholes are calling us 
                         names on the Internet, 'cause of 
                         this stupid movie!

                                     BANKY
                         I feel for you boys--I really do. 
                         Those Net snipers can be really cruel. 
                         But Miramax paid me a shitload of 
                         money for Bluntman and Chronic, so 
                         it occurs to me that people bad-
                         mouthing you on some web-site is 
                         none of my FUCKING CONCERN!

                                     SILENT BOB
                         Oh--but I think it is.

               Banky stares at Silent Bob, agog, Jay rolls his eyes.

                                     JAY
                         Here we go again--

                                     SILENT BOB
                         Shut the fuck up.
                              (to Banky)
                         We had a deal with you on the comics 
                         for likeness rights. And as we're 
                         not only the artistic basis but also 
                         the character basis for your 
                         intellectual property, Bluntman and 
                         Chronic, when we said property was 
                         optioned by Miramax Films you were 
                         legally obliged to secure our 
                         permission to transfer the concept 
                         to another medium. As you failed to 
                         do that, you're in breach of the 
                         original contract--ergo, you find 
                         yourself in a very actionable 
                         position.

               Banky stares at Bob, even more agog, joined by Jay. After a 
               beat, Jay adds--

                                     JAY
                         Yeah.

               Justice now has the advantage over Sissy, holding her head 
               and kicking her in the face, repeatedly, screaming.

                                     BANKY
                         So, what do you guys want, to go 
                         away and take your lady friends with 
                         you?

                                     JAY
                         Shitcan this movie so we don't get 
                         called names on the Internet anymore.

                                     BANKY
                         Even if there's no movie, people are 
                         still free to talk shit about you on 
                         the Internet. That's what the 
                         Internet's for: slandering others 
                         anonymously.  Stopping the flick 
                         isn't going to stop that!

               In the background, we see Justice high-kick Sissy into the 
               air.

                                     JAY
                         Well this isn't fair!  We went to 
                         Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole 
                         a monkey, we got shot at, and got 
                         punched in the motherfucking nuts! 
                         We ain't leaving empty-handed!

               On cue, Sissy drops from above, landing in Jay's lap.

                                     JAY
                         What's up baby? You look good!

                                     BANKY
                         Isn't that your girlfriend's enemy?

                                     JAY
                         Oh yeah.
                              (pushing Sissy off 
                              him)
                         Get the fuck offa me, pig!

               Sissy races at Justice, leaping atop her, pulling her hair.

               Jay, Bob, and Banky continue.

                                     BANKY
                         You guys are gonna ruin my movie 
                         career.

                                     JAY
                         Well, we want something for our mental 
                         anguish.

                                     BANKY
                         Tell you what: we'll settle this 
                         monetarily. I'll give you half of 
                         what I made.

                                     JAY
                         Half?!?

                                     BANKY
                         Half's not good enough?  Fine--I'll 
                         give you two-thirds of what I made!

                                     JAY
                         Fuck-you--you already said half? You 
                         can't take it back!

               Silent Bob rolls his eyes, Banky shakes Jay's hand.

                                     BANKY
                         Done

               Justice throws Sissy off, onto the floor. Both get up, facing 
               each other.

                                     SISSY
                         Your shit is so tired, Justice!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH!

               Justice high-kicks Sissy and she goes flying across the stage.

               Sissy sails toward the craft service table, landing atop 
               Missy and Chrissy, knocking them out.

               Willenholly stands to see why the girls stopped shooting.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Hello? Truce?
                              (beat)
                         I think I killed both of them.

               Suddenly, he lets out a shriek and falls forward, revealing 
               a tranquilizer dart in his ass, and SUZANNE standing behind 
               him, holding the gun up in the air.  Justice surveys her 
               handiwork for a beat, then calls off toward the Bluntmobile.

                                     JUSTICE
                         C'mon guys. It's over.

               Jay, Bob, and Banky pop up from behind the car and join her.

                                     JAY
                         Yo, I was just about to jump in there 
                         and get your back.

               Then, the SOUND of SIRENS rings out in the distance.

                                     JAY
                         Holy shit, the cops! We gotta get 
                         out of here!

                                     JUSTICE
                         No. I'm tired of running.

               Justice lifts Willenholly into a sitting position and taps 
               his face.

                                     JUSTICE
                         You awake, Marshal? Marshal?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (tries to move but 
                              can't)
                         Oh my God, I'm paralyzed. The monkey 
                         shot me in the ass and paralyzed me! 
                         Oh the irony!

                                     JUSTICE
                              (off Suzanne's gun)
                         You're not paralyzed. It was just a 
                         tranquilizer.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Jesus! Tranqued by a little monkey! 
                         My friends in the Bureau are never 
                         gonna let me live this down!

                                     JUSTICE
                         You have friends in the F.B.I.?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                              (crying)
                         They all made it in, but I failed 
                         the exam. Why the hell else do you 
                         think I became a Federal Wildlife 
                         Marshal? 'Cause I'm a joke!

               Justice looks toward the direction of the sirens, thinking. 
               Then--

                                     JUSTICE
                         Maybe not. I can make you a deal 
                         that'll get you into the F.B.I., 
                         regardless of test scores.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         What kind of deal?

                                     JUSTICE
                         You drop the charges against Jay and 
                         Silent Bob and say you never found 
                         the ape.  Make sure the world knows 
                         they're not in control of any C.L.I.T.

                                     JAY
                         Now wait a second--

                                     JUSTICE
                         I'll explain later, Jay
                              (to Willenholly)
                         In exchange, I'll give you the 
                         diamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy, 
                         Missy, Chrissy, and myself. But I 
                         want a reduced sentence.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         You'd be willing to do that?

                                     JUSTICE
                              (off Jay)
                         For him? I'd be willing to do 
                         anything.

               Justice stands and takes Jay by the hands.

                                     JUSTICE
                         I'm an international jewel thief 
                         who's facing a jail sentence.

                                     JAY
                         That's alright. I'm a junkie with a 
                         monkey.

                                     JUSTICE
                         If I go to prison, will you wait for 
                         me?

                                     JAY
                         I don't know. Will we fuck when you 
                         get out?

               Justice smiles and kisses Jay Passionately. The kiss should 
               say it all, but--

                                     JAY
                         Don't change the subject. Will we 
                         fuck when you get out?

                                     JUSTICE
                         Snoogans.

               Justice and Jay kiss again.

               Suzanne reached up to Silent Bob, who picks her up. She grabs 
               his face and kisses him.

               Willenholly looks to Banky.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Wow. There's a lot of love in the 
                         room.

                                     BANKY
                         Regardless of what you may have heard. 
                         I do not kiss guys.

               EXT. SOUNDSTAGE--LATER

               Justice and Jay are still kissing, until Willenholly pulls 
               her away and loads her into the waiting Cop Car.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Sorry, Justice. We've gotta go.
                              (to Jay: friendly)
                         Hey--stop stealing monkeys.

                                     JAY
                         Fuck you.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Fair enough.

               Willenholly closes the door behind Justice and gets in the 
               car.

                                     JUSTICE
                              (to Jay)
                         Wait for me.

                                     JAY
                         What--here?

               Jay looks at Justice, confused, as the Cruiser pulls away, 
               leaving Jay, Bob, Suzanne, and Banky. They start walking 
               down the lot.

                                     BANKY
                         Well, boys--you're rich in love--
                              (indicating Jay)
                         Well, you're in love. And to top 
                         that off, you've got your own monkey. 
                         What more could two guys from Jersey 
                         possibly want?

                                     JAY
                         All those fucks to stop talking shit 
                         about us on the Internet, for 
                         starters.

                                     BANKY
                         What do I keep telling you? There's 
                         not much you can do to stop that. 
                         Well, short of showing up at all 
                         their houses and beating the shit 
                         out of them, I guess.

               Jay and Bob suddenly freeze. They look at each other and 
               smile.

                                     JAY
                              (to Bob)
                         You know--with all that money we're 
                         gonna make we can buy a lotta plane 
                         tickets.

               START THE JAY AND BOB KICKASS MONTAGE

               EXT. SKY--DAY

               A passenger JET flies through the sky.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET--DAY

               Jay and Bob stand across the street from a house. They check 
               the address on the big ream of paper they're carrying, nod 
               at each other, and cross the street.

               INT. HOUSE--DAY

               The doorbell rings. A MOTHER answers it to see Jay and Silent 
               Bob standing in the doorway.

                                     MOTHER
                         Can I help you?

                                     JAY
                         Yes. Ma'am, Does--
                              (reading of paper)
                         William Dusky live here?

                                     MOTHER
                         Yes. He's my son.

                                     JAY
                         May we talk to him, please.

                                     MOTHER
                         One moment.

               She walks away. After a beat, a fifteen-year-old KID comes 
               to the door.

                                     KID
                         Yeah?

                                     JAY
                         Yo--do you post as--
                              (reading off paper)
                         Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com?

                                     KID
                         Yeah.

                                     JAY
                         And did you write "Fuck Jay and Silent 
                         Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses?

                                     KID
                         Yeah, a while ago. So?

               Jay and Bob nod at each other, then grab the KID, pull him 
               outside, and start beating the shit out of him on his front 
               lawn.

               EXT. SKY--DAY

               The passenger jet flies again, this time in the opposite 
               direction.

               EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE--DAY

               Jay and Bob knocking at another door. Another MOTHER answers. 
               They speak, she heads inside, and another KID comes to the 
               door.

                                     JAY
                         On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say 
                         Jay and Silent Bob--
                              (reading off paper)
                         "--are fucking clown shoes. If they 
                         were real, I'd beat the shit out of 
                         them for being so stupid."

                                     KID
                              (chuckling)
                         Yeah.

                                     JAY
                         Really--

               Again, Jay and Bob pull the Kid outside and beat the shit 
               out of him.

               INT. CONVENIENCE STORE--DAY

               Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a CLERK.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY--DAY

               Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a WOMAN.

               EXT. RECTORY--DAY

               Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a PRIEST.

               INT. OFFICE--DAY

               Jay and Bob beat the shit out of a BUSINESSMAN.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATRE--NIGHT

               The marquee reads: JASON BIGGS AND JAMES VAN DER BEEK ARE 
               BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC!

               WORLD PREMIERE!

               The front doors open and the CROWD lets out. First we see 
               DANTE and RANDAL.

                                     RANDAL
                         Now that was worse then Clash of the 
                         Titans.

                                     DANTE
                         I still can't believe Judy Dench 
                         played me.

                                     RANDAL
                         Hey--remind me to renew that 
                         restraining order.

                                     DANTE
                         Why?

                                     RANDAL
                         Because I'm gonna blast the flick on 
                         the Internet tonight.

               STEVE-DAVE and WALT exit.

                                     STEVE-DAVE
                         Why can't Hollywood ever make a decent 
                         comic book movie?

                                     WALT
                         Tell'em Steve-Dave!

                                     STEVE-DAVE
                         Would you stop saying that?

               ALYSSA and TRISH come out.

                                     TRISH
                         Well, that was just another paean to 
                         male adolescence and its refusal to 
                         grow up.

                                     ALYSSA
                         Yeah, sis--but it was better than 
                         Mallrats. At least Holden had the 
                         good sense to keep his name off of 
                         it.

                                     TRISH
                         Why wouldn't Miramax option his other 
                         comic instead? You know--the one he 
                         drew about you and him and your 
                         relationship?

                                     ALYSSA
                         You mean Chasing Amy? That would 
                         never work as a movie.

               BANKY and HOOPER exit.

                                     BANKY
                         I'm so fucking embarrassed--

                                     HOOPER
                         Honey, you should be. They took your 
                         characters and reduced them to one 
                         ninety-minute-long-gay joke. It was 
                         like watching Batman and Robin again.

                                     BANKY
                         Thanks. That means a lot coming from 
                         the guy who pretends to be Shaft as 
                         opposed to the guy who takes shaft.

                                     HOOPER
                         I don't hear you complaining nightly. 
                         In fact, the only thing I do hear 
                         you say is "Yes, Hooper! Cradle the 
                         balls and work the shaft!"

                                     BANKY
                              (looking around)
                         Hey! Hey! What'd we say? Not in 
                         public!

               A guy behind them calls out to Banks.

                                     GUY
                         Nice movie, you fucking Tracer!

                                     BANKY
                              (recognizing him)
                         You--!

                                     GUY
                         That's right, you sonovabitch! I'm 
                         back for round two!

               Banky grabs the guy by the throat and starts choking him, 
               while Hooper tries to break them up.

               WILLENHOLLY exits with Justice in hand-and leg cuffs and a 
               prison uniform.  They're flanked by two ARMED PRISON GUARDS.

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         You know, I don't get out to the 
                         movies much. But I'd have to say 
                         Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic!

                                     JUSTICE
                         Are these leg cuffs really necessary?

                                     WILLENHOLLY
                         Don't make me shoot you, Justice.

               And finally, Jay and Silent Bob come out.

                                     JAY
                         YO! THE PARTY'S ACROSS THE STREET, 
                         FEATURING THE GREATEST BAND IN THE 
                         WORLD: MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME!!!

               WHIP PAN to Morris day and The Time on stage, performing 
               "The Bird." During the song, Morris points to--

               Jay and Bob, who are dancing with Suzanne and Justice (who's 
               still in cuffs, flanked by the Guards). Jay looks to Bob, 
               they nod at each other and--

               Jay and Silent Bob, join Morris Day and the TIME onstage, 
               and dance us out to the coda, which reads--

               CODA

               Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3 
               million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial 
               failure in the history of Miramax films.  The film was roundly 
               drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat 
               boards, and over the course of the next year, while they 
               waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay 
               and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out 
               of them.

               CREDITS. THEN--

               INT. NOWHERE

               A familiar WOMAN closes a book that's marked: THE VIEW 
               ASKEWNIVERSE. She puts the book down, smiles at us and skips 
               off.

          INT. LEECH LAKE WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI, 17, sits on her hospital bed in
          pajamas. She's a plain-faced girl with a haunted
          expression. As she stares out the window, she winds
          colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a
          "god's eye."
          
          Out a single window, we see an imposing nine-foot
          SECURITY FENCE.
          
          Next to Needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered
          casually on the floor. There are letters, packages, even
          creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans."
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Every day, I get letters. I think
                    I get more letters than Santa
                    Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil
                    combined. I'm kind of the shit.
          
          RAYMUNDO, a counselor raps on the door and sticks his
          head in cautiously.
          
                                  RAYMUNDO
                    Rec time in five minutes, Needy.

                    Grassy-ass, Raymundo.
          
          Needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional
          gym uniform. As she slips off her pajamas, we can see a
          series of puffy, slash-like SCARS on her body.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Sometimes the letters are from
                    people who say they're praying for
                    me. They tell me everything will
                    be okay if I just accept Jesus
                    Christ into my heart. I say the
                    words, but nothing ever happens.
                    Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off
                    the cross.
          
          She glances sadly at a PHOTO OF A BOY on her dresser. She
          touches the frame wistfully, her eyes full of remorse.

                    Occasionally I get presents from
                    starfuckers who saw my picture in
                    the paper and want to marry me or
                    something. They think they can
                    take me away from all this.

                    Like I'd really date some
                    perverted Chester with a hard-on
                    for jailbait. I might be insane,
                    but I'm not desperate.
          
          We see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in
          from guys. They line the mirror, grinning at us. There's
          even a DICK SHOT tucked in there.
          
          Needy pulls on her threadbare uniform T-shirt. It hangs
          down to her knees, covering her shorts.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    A lot of people ask me if I'm
                    sorry I did it.
          
          Needy picks up a paper cup of COLORFUL PILLS on her
          dresser, dumps the meds into her mouth, and dry-swallows
          them.

                         (ALOUD)
                    I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.
          
          She saunters out of the room in her GYM UNIFORM and BUNNY
          SLIPPERS.
          
          
          INT. LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL GYMNASIUM - MORNING
          
          Several badminton courts are set up in the gym. As an
          intense OPERATIC ARIA plays over the public address
          system, the FEMALE PATIENTS enthusiastically--almost
          violently--whack at the flying shuttlecocks.
          
          The patients appear to be varying levels of crazy. A
          TOOTHLESS WOMAN grins as she dives with her racket,
          clipping her partner in the leg. In the corner, one
          forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another
          hurls her racket against the wall again and again.
          Counselors look on approvingly, despite how miserable
          their charges appear. In the background, a few sulking
          patients jump rope.
          
          Needy enters the gym unnoticed, padding along in her
          bunny slippers.

                    Welcome to the Mental Olympics.
                    They're big on recreation here.
                    Supposedly it helps us vent our
                    aggressions. We've traded in our
                    hatchets for rackets, our Drain-O
                    bombs for double dutch.

                    action when they're fully
                    conscious.
          
          We see a GIRL swinging a jump rope who has a ladder of
          fresh bandages on her arms and legs.

          Nelly shuffles over to a tetherball and takes a furious
          WHACK at it.
          
          INT. LEECH LAKE CAFETERIA - ONE HOUR LATER
          The freshly showered PATIENTS assemble for breakfast.
          They grab trays and settle into noisy cliques. Needy
          selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line
          and sits down, alone.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Personally, I think they're trying
                    to wear us out. Keep us sluggish
                    so there won't be an uprising.
                    Well, those J.V. tactics won't
                    work against me. I'm a kicker. K-I-
                    C-K-E-R. It even says so on my
                    chart.
          
          We briefly cut to Needy's chart, on some doctor's
          clipboard. We see her name: ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI and a
          few brief details about FIRST DEGREE MURDER and GRANDIOSE
          NOTIONS. Beneath that, we see a triple-highlighted
          warning in bright ink: KICKER.
          A NUTRITIONIST with a clipboard approaches Needy casually
          and eyes her breakfast plate.
          
                                  NUTRITIONIST
                    Just one Toastem, huh?

                                     NUTRITIONIST
                       That's good. But I'm not sure a
                       Toastem can provide you with
                       sufficient energy for your day.
                       I'd recommend more complex
                       carbohydrates...

          CONTINUED:
          
          Needy scrambles to her feet and delivers a sudden,
          powerful ROUNDHOUSE KICK to the nutritionist's face.
                                  NEEDY
                    I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU SHUT THE
                    FUCK UP!
          
          The nutritionist is KNOCKED OFF HER FEET-- as if she's
          been kicked by a far mightier creature than Needy-- and
          collapses, clutching her bleeding nose. We see that the
          bone has SNAPPED.
          The patients shriek. Chaos. As Needy is restrained by
          staff members, she thrashes like a trapped fish.
          Needy snorts up a killer LOOGIE and hocks it at the prone
          nutritionist. The glob nails her in the eye.
          
          It takes four STAFF MEMBERS to haul Needy away as she
          hollers in protest.
          
          The nutritionist curls up on the floor, cupping her
          bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds
          her. She spits out a TOOTH.
          
          INT. "THE HOLE" - SAME
          Needy is tossed into seclusion. Her hair is wild and her
          face is wet with tears. The heavy door slams behind her,
          leaving only a shaft of light.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I wasn't always this cracked. I
                    used to be normal-- well, as
                    normal as any girl under the
                    influence of teenage hormones. But
                    after the killings began, I
                    started to feel, I don't know...
                    loose around the edges or
                    something. I was coming undone
                    like those jeans I made in Home
                    Ec. Falling to pieces like Patsy
                    Cline. Shredded like moo-shu pork.
                    Dead inside.
          Needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract SHAPES
          in the darkness. Grinning skulls. Faces drained of life,
          half eaten. Grimaces of terror.
          Suddenly, soft music   is piped into "the hole," ostensibly
          to calm the patients   in solitary. Needy shudders and
          recoils at the sound   of it. It's a CHEESY ROCK BALLAD
          that we'll soon hear   again...

                    God, I hate this fucking song.
          
          
          Needy plugs her ears as if it physically hurts her to
          listen to the song. She curls up in the corner and steels
          herself for solitary confinement.
                                                          DISSOLVE TO:
          TITLE: TWO MONTHS EARLIER
          
          EXT. DEVIL'S KETTLE, MN - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)
          Devil's Kettle is a quiet farming community, surrounded
          by dense woods and mirrored lakes. It's the kind of town
          that has one high school, one pizza joint, and one
          stoplight.
          
          On an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that
          reads "WELCOME TO DEVIL'S KETTLE- Pop. 7,036. Come See
          What's Cookin'!"
                                  NEEDY
                    This is where it all went down.
                    "Devil's Kettle" sounds twisted, I
                    know, but the place just is named
                    after a dumb waterfall.
          
          
          EXT. THE FALLS - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)
          We see the titular falls, surprisingly powerful, gushing
          over a rock face.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Well technically, it's two
                    waterfalls. One of them is normal--
                    it empties into a river basin. But
                    the other one goes into a hole.
                    And it doesn't come out. The
                    scientist guys can't explain it.
                    They've dropped all kinds of
                    things down there--bouncy balls,
                    red dye, radioactive slime-- but
                    nothing ever surfaces.

          EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE (TO ESTABLISH) - MIDNIGHT
          The sprawling ranch house is dark from the outside except
          for a single FIRST FLOOR WINDOW-- Jennifer's-- still
          illuminated.
          There's a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the
          backyard. We're definitely in deep north country.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I've probably spent years of my
                    life in this house. Hundreds of
                    sleepovers, thousands of aimless
                    homework sessions, a million phone
                    calls. I've climbed through
                    Jennifer's window so many times.
                    But tonight, only one of us is
                    going to come out.
          
          INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - SAME
          JENNIFER CHECK lies on her bed, fidgeting as she watches
          TV. She's a girl of 16 with LONG, MATTED HAIR and a thin,
          frail body. Her features are gorgeous, but she looks sick
          and haggard. She picks at her skin with yellowed,
          Nosferatu-like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock
          of hair.
          Jennifer wears a tight T-shirt that says KETTLE HIGH
          FLAGS and underwear.
          
          An `80s HORROR MOVIE flickers on the TV. Jennifer half-
          watches, distracted.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Jennifer didn't always look this
                    rough. Actually, she was the
                    prettiest girl in Devil's Kettle
                    when she wasn't so...hungry.
          
          Some recent photos on a corkboard reveal that Jennifer
          was indeed BEAUTIFUL AND CURVY.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    She hadn't fed in weeks.
          
          Jennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly.
          We see the OUTSIDE of the house again. It's dark and
          silent, but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs.
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Jennifer turns her attention back to the TV.
          Suddenly, we see NEEDY'S FACE pop up against the window,
          white and startling. Before Jennifer notices, the face
          disappears.
          Outside the house, the bushes rustle. Needy is crouched
          below the window. We hear the pulsing of her HEART as if
          via ultrasound. It's a wet, rhythmic sound: Sploish,
          sploish, sploish.
          
          Inside, Jennifer stretches and shuts off the TV. She
          turns out the light. A beat of silence.
          Then, the sound of cracking near the window.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Huh?
          Needy PLUNGES through the window, screaming and
          brandishing a HAMMER. She takes a SWING at Jennifer's
          head, but misses and BURIES IT IN THE WALL, specifically
          in Jennifer's Fall Out Boy poster.
          Needy throws herself on top of Jennifer. She STRADDLES
          Jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her.
                                  NEEDY
                    You'll throw me a bone, huh? Huh?
                    You killed Chip! You goddamned
                    monster! You...ZOMBITCH!
          
          Jennifer struggles to fight off Needy in the darkness.
          Her clawlike fingernails rake Needy's back and arms.
          
          Needy pulls a BOX CUTTER out of her waistband and flicks
          it open like a switchblade. Kshink!
                                  JENNIFER
                         (GAGGING)

                    at Home Depot? God, you're butch.

                    Know what this is for? Cutting
                    boxes.
          She takes a swipe at Jennifer's CROTCH. Jennifer
          instinctively CLUTCHES herself and rears up in defense.
          We see Jennifer's mouth come down on Needy's neck. Needy
          shrieks as if BITTEN, but continues to strangle Jennifer,
          straddling her and bearing down.

          CONTINUED: (2)
          
          Jennifer's T-shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her
          breasts. For a moment, her eyes meet Needy's and she
          grins. It's as if she has control over Needy for a split
          second, sexual control...
          Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifer's body left and right
          with the box-cutter, marking a gory, oozing "X" on her
          torso.

          Jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and
          disbelief. She looks back up at Needy. A beat of silence.
          Suddenly, THE GIRLS' BODIES LEVITATE RAPIDLY TOWARD THE
          CEILING. They wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne
          heap, their figures entwined. Their bodies FALL,
          collapsing back onto the bed with a thud.
          
          Needy raises the box-cutter and plunges it into
          Jennifer's HEART. Blood GEYSERS from the wound.

          Suddenly, the room is flooded with BRIGHT LIGHT,
          revealing a Needy straddling Jennifer's MUTLIATED BODY.
          Jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle.
          MRS. CHECK, a middle-aged woman in bad sleepwear and a
          worse perm rushes into the bedroom.
                                  MRS. CHECK
                    Jennifer! What is it, baby? Oh my
                    God! Oh my God!
          She pulls Needy off her daughter. Jennifer rolls over,
          gasping and bleeding.

                    Needy?
          Needy drops the boxcutter. It lands on Jennifer's copy of
          Flag Team Quarterly, splashing the model with fresh gore.
          
                                  NEEDY

          Mrs. Check cradles her maimed daughter on the floor like
          a white-trash Pieta. Jennifer takes one last breath,
          vomits blood, and DIES.
          Mrs. Check SCREAMS. Needy SMILES.
          
          EXT. JENNIFER CHECK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
          Three police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and
          lights engaged. OFFICER ROMAN DUDA, 22, a muscular young
          COP, jogs authoritatively toward the house. He shakes his

          Needy, innocent-looking in PIGTAILS, is hustled into the
          back of the squad car. Her clothes and face are smeared
          with blood.
          Officer Duda starts the ignition. His partner, a hard-
          faced FEMALE COP, slides into the front seat. Her cap is
          pushed back to accommodate a huge round pouf of
          shellacked MALL BANGS.

                    couldn't look like a nerd, but I
                    couldn't upstage her either. I
                    could expose my stomach, but never
                    cleavage. Tits were her trademark.
          
          Needy wiggles her jeans a bit lower, exposing her
          childishly round tummy. She walks out of the bathroom
          into her bedroom, a frilly pink hell complete with canopy

                    bunch of faygos.
                                  JENNIFER
                    You would think that. You're such
                    a small-time Gomer. I wish we had
                    more guys like that in Devil's
                    Kettle. All stylish and shit.
          Needy nods dumbly. She stares at the band, awestruck.

                    They look so-- so cool.
          She gazes at the stage, hearing only the whistling rush
          of ARCTIC AIR. In SLOW MOTION, the GUITARIST unsheathes
          his Fender Jaguar from its gig bag. He notices her
          staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips.
          Needy swallows hard.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Hey, I think they need two
                    groupies. Come on! It'll be like
                    Almost Famous! I'll be Penny Lane
                    and you can be the other girl.
          She grabs Needy's hand and enthusiastically tries to drag
          her toward the stage.
          
                                  NEEDY
                    No!
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Don't be J.V., Needy. They're just
                    boys. Morsels. We have all the
                    power, don't you know that?
          She plants her hands on Needy's CHEST.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    These things are like smart bombs.
                    Point `em in the right direction
                    and shit gets real.
          
          Needy shrugs free of Jennifer's grasp and follows her
          reluctantly across the room.
          
          The lead singer of Soft Shoulder, NIKOLAI WOLF, is
          already striding forward to meet them at the lip of the
          stage. His gait is as smooth as his shock of dyed-black
          hair.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Hi. Um, we just really wanted to
                    meet you or something? I'm
                    Jennifer Check and this is my
                    friend.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    I'm Nikolai Wolf, and this is my
                    band.
          He reaches down and pumps Jennifer's outstretched hand.

                    Yeah! Soft Shoulder, right? I've
                    heard you guys are super, super
                    good at playing your instruments.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    I hope we can live up to
                    such...high praise.
                                  NEEDY
                    Hey, if you don't mind me asking,
                    why did you want to play all the
                    way out here in Devil's Kettle?
                    You live in the city, right?
                                   NIKOLAI
                    Yeah. But I think it's so
                    important to connect with our fans
                    in rural areas. Plus, the
                    audiences in small towns really
                    appreciate us.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Can I show you my appreciation
                    right now?
          Needy looks at the floor, embarrassed.
          
          Jennifer's voice scales up nervously.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Like, I'll buy you a drink? I
                    mean, I'll see if I can get you a
                    drink. They make this great 9/11
                    tribute shooter? It's red, white
                    and blue, but you have to drink it
                    fast or it gets all brownish.
                                    NIKOLAI
                           (GRIMACING)
                    Mmm.
          Jennifer hurries off toward the bar.
          
          Needy moves self-consciously into a nearby corner, not
          wanting to continue the conversation with Nikolai alone.
          A LOCAL plugs a Loretta Lynn tune into the jukebox, with
          a challenging stare at the band. A DRUNK COUPLE begins
          two-stepping in front of the stage.
          Nikolai walks up to the guitar player, DIRK, and pulls
          him aside. Needy pricks up her ears and listens.

                                  DIRK
                         (gesturing to Needy)
                    Who, Training Bra Jones?
          
          Needy looks offended.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    No, the hot one. The one who just
                    walked away. She's it, man. She's
                    exactly what we're looking for.
                                  DIRK
                    You're sure she's...
                                  NIKOLAI
                    She's a kid. We're in God's
                    country, man. Everyone out here's
                    a fundie bible-banger. Of course
                    she's a virgin.
          Dirk hesitates.
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    Dirk, we didn't haul our asses out
                    to this corn palace for nothing!
                                  DIRK
                    Fine. Okay. You know, I know I'm
                    not "just the bassist." I'm a
                    person who happens to play the
                    bass guitar. And I would like some
                    respect...
          
          Nikolai is already ignoring him.
          Needy, alarmed, emerges from her hiding place and
          discreetly rushes over to the bar where Jennifer is
          arguing with a jealous-looking Roman. He shakes his head
          in disgust and leaves the bar.
          Jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious PATRIOTIC
          THEMED DRINK. She laughs when she sees Needy's concerned
          expression.
                                  JENNIFER
                    What? Are you scared of rock stars
                    too?
                                  NEEDY

                                  NEEDY
                    Only because he thinks you're a
                    virgin. I heard them talking.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Yeah, right! I'm not even a
                    backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to
                    Roman. By the way, that hurts. I
                    couldn't even go to flags the next
                    day. I had to stay home and sit on
                    a bag of frozen peas.

                    Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I
                    can do innocent. I'll be Little
                    Miss Fucking Sunshine.

                    Don't cock-block me, Needy.
          
          Piercing FEEDBACK signals the beginning of the set.
          Nikolai takes the mic and smiles broadly.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Good evening, Devil's Lake.
          Someone in the back shouts "Devil's Kettle!"
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. Anyway, we're Soft
                    Shoulder. And we just want to make
                    you happy.
          He WINKS at Jennifer.
          The band launch into the same intense, soaring song we
          heard in the COP CAR and the HOLE. Jennifer's eyes never
          leave Nikolai's. She's hypnotized, clinging to Needy's
          arm. Even the locals look charmed.
          Suddenly, a lick of FLAME appears on the wood paneling
          next to the stage. Needy is the first to notice. As she
          watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses.

          The flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to
          blaze uncontrollably. People SCREAM and scatter. Someone
          ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the
          fire.
          Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. He and Chas
          exchange glances. The BASS PLAYER pitches his guitar
          aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons
          his kit. Nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he
          watches from the stage...is he smiling?
          CHAOS. Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once,
          causing a stampede. A woman's clothes and hair CATCH FIRE
          and she falls to her knees. We see a BEAM fall from the
          roof, nearly killing AHMET FROM INDIA.
          Jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state.

                    I know where to go!
          Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the
          tiny BATHROOM. Choking on smoke, they climb onto the
          Sticker Toilet (which now sports a giant SOFT SHOULDER
          sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the
          BATHROOM WINDOW. Hundreds are still trapped inside,
          screaming.
          
          EXT. THE CAROUSEL- CONTINUOUS
          Jennifer collapses in Needy's arms, coughing. Needy hugs
          her fiercely, almost romantically. She cups Jennifer's
          flushed face and looks into her eyes.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                         (DAZED)
                    It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on
                    fire. Oh God, I'm burning!
          
                                  NEEDY
                    You're okay, I promise. You got
                    burned worse when you wore that
                    tin-foil bikini to the beach.
                    Everything's fine.
          Suddenly, a HAND clamps onto Jennifer's shoulder. Both
          girls jump. It's Nikolai, his forehead creased with false
          concern.
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Are you girls all right?

                    We're great. Maybe you should try
                    to find your band?
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Those guys? They were the first
                    ones out the door. Ran for the van
                    like a bunch of Marys. Frankly,
                    I'm ashamed of them.
          Needy narrows her eyes suspiciously.
          Muffled SCREAMS rise up from the flame-engulfed building.
          Jennifer covers her ears and cowers, sweat rolling down
          her face.
          
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    God, it feels like hell out here.
                    Come and hang with us in the van
                    for a while, just until they hose
                    this place down.
          
                                     JENNIFER
                    Okay...okay...
          She slumps against Nikolai's chest.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    You're in shock. Here, drink this.
                    You'll feel better.
          He smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of PEACH SCHNAPPS
          from his coat and holds it to Jennifer's lips. She swigs
          it cooperatively, dribbling down her chin.
          
          Needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence.
                                  NEEDY
                    Aren't you a little freaked out
                    about this? What about all your
                    stuff? It's probably melting, and

                    you'll have to do like, a crappy

                         (SLURRING)
                    I want to see your van. C'mon
                    Needy, let's go to the van.
                                  NEEDY
                    Why? Why should we? We have the
                    Malibu. Let's just get out of
                    here. We can go to El Ojo and get
                    Northwoods Nachos with extra
                    Badger Sauce! Please? I'm
                    starving.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Needy, stop it. Just stop it!
          She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN, which
          is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar.
          Needy staggers after them slowly, watching.
          Behind Needy, the bar EXPLODES. Screams. Flames. Silence.
          Needy doesn't even look back as she watches Jennifer get
          into the van. Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes.
          
          Nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van,
          revealing his slick, muscled white torso.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I watched her get into that van
                    and I knew something awful was
                    going to happen. But for some
                    reason, I felt drawn toward them.
                    Toward him. He was pale and
                    twisted and evil, like this
                    petrified tree I saw when I was a
                    kid.
          
          EXT. PETRIFIED FOREST NATIONAL PARK - (FLASHBACK)
          We see LITTLE NEEDY, about five years old, staring up at
          a petrified tree in the darkness, horrified yet
          compelled. The tree seems to stoop forward, cracking...
          
          BACK ON NEEDY:
          Needy's face is fixed in the same haunted expression.
          Nikolai turns to look at her, his teeth bared in a
          vicious smile.
          Needy turns and sprints off in the opposite direction,
          away from the van and the fire.
          
                                                               29.
          
          
          
          
          INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM - 11:00 P.M.
          Needy stumbles into her bedroom, overwhelmed. Her clothes
          are smoke damaged and her cheeks are sooty.
          She grabs her cheap, taped-up cell phone and dials CHIP's
          number shakily.

          INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          Chip's bedroom is pitch black until a cheap cell phone
          lights up under the covers illuminating his sleeping
          form, clad only in jockey shorts.

                    you were sleeping with your phone.

                                  NEEDY
                    Jennifer's gone. She ran off with
                    that rock band. And the Carousel
                    burned down.
          CHIP sits bolt upright
          
                                  CHIP

                                  NEEDY

                    We went out the bathroom window.
                    Everyone else was trying to use
                    the door. It was like a stampede.
                    The people who fainted got run
                    over and you could hear their
                    bones breaking.

                    one of those white molester vans

          Needy hangs up the phone and rushes downstairs. As she
          passes through the shadowy kitchen, appliances HUM all
          around her. The silence is menacing.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (FRONT ENTRY) - CONTINUOUS
          Needy opens the door. Nobody there.
          She slams the door, turns around and SCREAMS.

          Jennifer is standing in the dark hallway, looking ghostly
          pale and smiling. Her clothes are tattered and stained--
          her entire front is soaked in blood. Her makeup is
          smeared, and her eyes are bruised and sunken like a
          zombie's. She looks HORRIFYING, especially with that
          ghastly, clownish grin.
          
                                     NEEDY

          Jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood-

                    What happened?
          Utter silence. Then a dripping sound. Needy looks down
          and sees large drops of blood spattering the linoleum.
          Jennifer continues to smile, staring directly at Needy.

          Jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee SCREAM, wailing at
          the top of her lungs. She vomits a torrent of evil-
          looking black bile all over herself and Needy and
          staggers wildly down the hallway.
          
          The bloody black bile hits the wall, splashing a framed
          school portrait of Needy. Needy screams and watches in
          horror as it slides down the wall.
          The bile has hundred of tiny SPINES sticking out of it,
          like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by
          itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the
          corners. It's truly revolting.
          Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her
          mouth.
          Jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to
          jagged, insane laughter.
          Needy tries to run, but Jennifer grabs her and THROWS her
          against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her.
          Jennifer slowly, tantalizingly brushes her face against
          Needy's hair, her earlobe. Needy doesn't move a muscle.
          Jennifer's hand slides up Needy's ribcage. She presses
          her lips against Needy's carotid artery.
          We hear Needy's blood pumping, swishing.

          Needy nods.
          Jennifer parts her lips. Then suddenly, she stops and
          PULLS AWAY, pushing Needy to the floor. Jennifer bolts
          out the front door and takes off running down the street.
          Needy is motionless for a moment, then stumbles toward
          the doorway.

          INT. KETTLE HIGH - THE NEXT MORNING
          Moments before the first morning bell. Needy is sitting
          at her desk in English class, still visibly bruised from
          her scuffle with Jennifer the night before. She looks
          like she hasn't slept a wink.
          The mood is quiet and somber-- kids whisper about the
          fire and gather in groups.

                    way out with a machete.

          unscathed. She smiles brightly at Needy as if nothing

          She looks down at her hands. There's DRIED BLOOD under
          her fingernails.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Her blood was still under my
                    nails. See, I'd been up all night
                    scrubbing the carnage off the
                    linoleum.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (FRONT ENTRY) - DAWN (FLASHBACK)
          We see Needy on her hands and knees in the eerie blue
          light of dawn, sobbing as she diligently scrubs blood and
          bile off the floor with a dirty sponge. The black, spiny
          vomit repulses her, and she gags.
          
          She reaches for a Swiffer WetJet mop and pulls the
          trigger. No solution comes out. She curses, hysterical
          and sleep-deprived.

          She collapses in tears on the floor.

                    of your more freakish Needy
                    behaviors and it makes us both
                    look like total gaylords.
          Needy raises her hands desperately to Jennifer, spreading
          her fingers to display her filthy fingernails.

          MR. WROBLEWSKI, a middle-aged teacher, enters the room.
          He has a gnarly-looking robotic hand and moves awkwardly.

          Mr. Wroblewski clears his throat. His voice quavers.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI
                    I'm sure those of you who made it
                    here today have all heard the
                    news. It's a dark day for Devil's
                    Kettle, a day we can never, ever
                    forget.
          A single, stifled sob rises from the class. Needy glances
          around the room and sees students fighting back tears. A
          huge JOCK weeps openly, tears spattering his swimsuit-
          model decorated notebook. Jennifer smirks, barely able to
          contain her laughter.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)
                    The administration here has
                    decided that today will be a
                    unstructured day of support and
                    remembrance. We've lost nine
                    precious students-- including
                    Ahmet from India-- several
                    parents, and a teacher, Ms.
                    Parrish.
          He fights back tears.
                                  JENNIFER
                    No way! Parrish ate shit?
          
          Needy shushes her, appalled.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI
                    This tragedy is obviously beyond
                    anything we can measure. More than
                    ever, we need to band together and
                    draw strength from each other.
          Mr. Wroblewski painstakingly retrieves a tissue from his
          pocket with his robotic hand and dabs at his face.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D)

                    We can rise up. We can overcome
                    death.
          
          Needy eyes Jennifer warily.

                    didn't talk. She just stood there,
                    smiling at me, but a bad kind of
                    smile. She looked like she'd been
                    beat up or shot or something. She

          It's a gray, overcast fall day and the wind whistles
          eerily through the trees. The football is set back a good
          a distance from the school, and Jonas is all alone.
          In the distance, a tiny figure slowly approaches, It
          starts a dot on the horizon. As it draws closer, we see
          it's JENNIFER. Her bright, lipsticked grin is eerie and
          unmistakable.
          Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder,
          indifferent.
          A few seconds later, he glances again. Strangely,
          Jennifer ISN'T THERE.
          Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonas's left side, startling
          him.

                    I know. I was close to him too.
                    You know, I was there last night
                    in that horrible place. I saw
                    Craig a few minutes before the
                    fire broke out.

                    Well, we got to talking about you,
                    actually. And do you know what he
                    said? He said you were like a
                    brother to him. Not a bro. An
                    actual brother.
          
          Jonas's lip trembles as he unsuccessfully fights back
          tears. Jennifer cuddles closer to him.
                                  JONAS
                         (choking up)
                    I just can't believe he's gone.

                    I know, I know.

                    Hey, you know what else Craig

                                  JONAS
                    What?
                                  JENNIFER
                    Forget it. It's too intense.
                                  JONAS
                    What? Please, Jen, you've gotta
                    tell me!
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Well, he said he always thought
                    you and me would make a totally
                    bangin' couple. Isn't that so
                    weird?
          
                                  JONAS
                    He said bangin'?
          Jennifer reaches for Jonas's hand and slides it slowly up
          her shirt, placing it on her left breast.

                    We'll help each other get through
                    this nightmare. It's what Craig
                    would have wanted.
          Jonas nods dumbly, brainwashed. Jennifer leads him away
          from the field, toward the WOODS bordering the school
          campus. They vanish into the woods. In the distance, we
          see the FALLS rushing into the lake.

                    hallway, Chip. I saw. I used my
                    CPR training to check her pulse.
                    And I felt her dying, on the
                    inside, I mean. I've known her so
                    long that it's like sometimes I
                    can feel what she feels. We're

          Jennifer and Jonas are in the woods. Jennifer efficiently
          whips off her top and bra and begins kissing Jonas
          hungrily. As Jonas touches her, he recoils.
                                  JONAS
                    You feel so warm. Why are you so

                    Shutties!
          She pulls off Jonas' shirt and digs her nails into his
          arms, kissing him with renewed ferocity.
          
          The woods are dead silent. A few squirrels approach the
          clearing, and Jonas watches them warily with one open eye
          as Jennifer kisses him. Then a deer wanders into the
          clearing. Then a fox. The animals pause in their tracks
          and watch, motionless. It's an eerie, unnatural tableau.
          
          Animals continue to gather.
                                  JONAS

                    Look!
          He gestures to the ANIMALS, who are watching, still as
          statues. A few crows alight on a nearby tree.
                                  JENNIFER
                    Mm-hmm. They're waiting.

                    Uh, okay...
          Jennifer unzips Jonas's jeans and smiles, reaching down
          and working him with her hand. Jonas moans, still eyeing
          the animals.

          She smiles and shakes her head.
          Jonas jerks back, creeped out. He tries to pull away from
          Jennifer, but she's too strong. She PINS him to the tree.
          We see her jaw begin to UNHINGE, like some horrible
          snake. Her eyes cloud over with blood...

          stops in his tracks when he hears the scream. He shakes
          his head sadly.

          He heads for his Ford Festiva, then pauses as if thinking
          better of it. Something isn't right. He puts his keys
          back in his pocket and walks toward the woods to
          investigate.

          Suddenly, she pauses, a look of UNEASE and even FEAR

                    Hey Mom? Did you get a chance to
                    catch the news after you clocked
                    out this morning?
          
                                  TONI
                    No. I just did my scratch tickets,
                    snorted a few Lunesta and went
                    straight to bed. Is something

          EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - EARLY EVENING
          A hysterical SCREAM pierces the twilight.
          The sun has begun to set. An ambulance and four police
          cars have pulled up near the woods, which are cordoned
          off with yellow police tape. Near the woods, JONAS'S
          PARENTS are crying. His MOTHER screams and begins beating
          the ground with her fists.
          A stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance.
          OFFICER WARZAK exits one of the police cruisers. Her
          signature giant poofy bangs are in full effect.
          She rushes to comfort Jonas's bereaved mother.
                                  OFFICER WARZAK
                    We will get the man that did this
                    to your son. You hear me? We'll
                    get that sick M.F.
                                  JONAS'S DAD
                    I'll get him myself! I will! You
                    hear me, you bastard? I'll cut off
                    your nutsack and nail it to my
                    door! Like one of those lion
                    doorknockers rich folks got!
                    That'll be your balls!
          
          EXT. ACROSS THE LAKE - CONTINUOUS
          The sound of Jonas's parents screaming carries across the
          lake. The water is eerily calm.
          
          Suddenly, a HEAD breaks the surface of the lake. It's
          Jennifer, gliding through the water. She looks calm and
          serene.
          The SCREAMING continues across the lake. The sirens,
          shouting and chaos contrast sharply with this peaceful
          scene.
          Jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the
          pier, naked and dripping wet. She runs her tongue over
          her teeth briefly and nonchalantly picks something out
          from between her two front teeth, like she's just
          finished a delicious rib dinner.
          Jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her
          clothes, which are neatly folded on the pier.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Once she's dressed, she walks off into the woods, as if
          nothing out of the ordinary has happened.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S ROOM - EVENING
          Needy is sitting at her lamp-lit desk, reading an old
          E.C. horror comic and eating a banana.
          The phone rings. Needy picks it up.

          INT. JENNIFER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Jennifer's hair is still wet from the lake, but she's
          changed into shorts and a tank top. Music blasts from her
          stereo. She admires herself in the mirror, popping her
          ass.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    I feel sooo scrumptious!
          She picks up a Soft Shoulder button and POKES her arm
          hard with the pin without flinching. Blood spurts from
          the wound.
                                    NEEDY
                    Good for you.

                    You know, like when you kiss a hot
                    guy for the first time and your
                    whole body feels like it's on
                    vibrate.

                                  JENNIFER
                    It's that good.
          Jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed. She wipes the
          blood away-- the wound has magically DISAPPEARED.

          tongue-- first tentatively, then confidently.

          Needy's call-waiting beeps.

          She casually lights her HAIR on fire. The flames leap up,
          then die down, leaving her entirely untouched.

          She draws a mini-X in the air.
          Needy clicks over. It's CHIP. We get a nice trifold pie-
          chart illustrating the intersecting calls. CHIP is
          panicked and sweaty in his living room. In the
          background, Chip's little sister CAMILLE bangs on a
          piano. Red police lights flash outside the picture
          window.

          EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - FOURTEEN MINUTES LATER
          The park is dark and tree-lined and appears to be a
          popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of Devil's
          Kettle. The abandoned sand volleyball pits are full of
          couples making out. Needy runs past them skittishly.
          As she ascends a grassy hill, CHIP is revealed,
          silhouetted against a backdrop of twirling police lights.
          Needy squints at the lights, sees CHIP's house in the

          A SERIES OF NEWSPAPER HEADLINES
          The familiar Soft Shoulder ballad plays as we see a
          dreamy montage of headlines.
          The headline of the Devil's Kettle Sun-Post simply reads:
          "WHY?"
          The headline of the Minneapolis Star Tribune reads:
          "'BUTCHERED': Devil's Kettle youth brutally murdered in
          wake of devastating fire."
          
          A smaller headline on the front page of the New York
          Times reads: "Minnesota town rocked by grisly murder,
          blaze."

                    We were famous. We were saints.
                    Our town's only bar had burned to
                    the ground and our star
                    quarterback was somebody's Quarter
                    Pounder. The whole country got a
                    huge tragedy boner for Devil's
                    Kettle. And the press-- God, they
                    couldn't get enough of our little
                    world of shit.
          We see Devil's Kettle citizens holding a tearful
          candlelight vigil by the former Carousel site. They
          softly sing along with the Soft Shoulder song.

          We see weeping students shoving flowers through the slats
          of Jonas' abandoned locker. The hallway floor is covered
          with teddy bears and bouquets.
          We see the PASSING OF TIME as the bouquets wilt and the
          blooms droop.
          
          The pile of discarded scratch-off tickets next to Needy's
          mother's bed grows steadily as the days go by.
          Another Star Tribune headline. This one reads: "Two weeks
          later, cannibal killer still at large." A smaller subhead
          reads "ARTS: Local band Soft Shoulder sign to major."

                    most of us were too numb to enjoy
                    ourselves. Most of us.
          We see Jennifer cheerfully skipping down the school
          hallway in a sleazy Technicolor outfit. The rest of the
          kids look grey, ashen and depressed, but Jennifer pops
          like a Roman candle.

                    better. We had faith.
          
          We see clusters of cautiously optimistic kids in the
          school courtyard. They smile, then laugh, as if they're
          re-learning how to be happy.

                    healing. So, they've decided to
                    release it as a benefit single.

                       out with you.
                                     COLIN
                       No! Well-- yeah.
                            (BEAT)
                       How did you know?
          
                                     JENNIFER
                       Just go ahead with the pitch.
          Colin fidgets awkwardly.
          
                                  COLIN
                    Well, we've been having a lot of
                    fun in class, you and I, and I
                    just thought maybe we could go to
                    a movie or something. There's a
                    midnight showing of Rocky Horror
                    at the Bijou next weekend...
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    I don't like boxing movies.
                                  COLIN
                    It's not...fuck it. Never mind.
          He turns to walk down the hallway, dejected. Jennifer
          watches him leave.
                                     JENNIFER
                    Wait!
          Colin turns around.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you just come by my
                    place tonight? I just got
                    Aquamarine on DVD. It's about this
                    girl who's like, half-sushi. I
                    guess she has sex through her
                    blowhole or something.

                                  JENNIFER
                    I'll text you my address.
          Colin walks away, grinning triumphantly.

                    That was random.

                    Colin's a really nice guy.

                    He's into maggot-rock. He wears
                    nail polish.
          
          Chip appears behind Needy and drapes his arm over her
          shoulder. Needy jumps, startled.

          Needy puts her arm around Chip protectively.

          Chip looks relieved.

          Needy waves as Chip walks away.
          
          EXT. CAMERFORD STREET - NIGHT
          
          Colin Gray drives down the street in a big old boat of a
          classic car. He's blasting punk music on an iPod that's
          been rigged to the ancient AM radio.
          Colin holds up his CELL PHONE to re-read the directions
          Jennifer texted him.
          The street is extremely dark and silent, occupied only by
          a new townhouse development. The identical units still
          appear to be under construction. There aren't even any
          streetlights. The plastic sheeting over the windows flaps
          eerily in the breeze.
          Colin's brow furrows in confusion-- it doesn't even look
          like anyone lives here yet. He checks the phone display
          again.
          CLOSE ON PHONE:
          The TEXT MESSAGE reads:
          "trn lft on camerford and your there. first house on rt.
          1004 camerford. C-ya! xoxo jen"
          
          Sure enough, the house number is 1004. Colin throws the
          car into park and walks up to the porch. He looks up and
          notices a glow coming from an upstairs window,
          
          
                                                        (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Colin presses the doorbell. Nothing happens-- the house
          isn't wired for electricity yet.
          
          INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - SAME
          Needy and CHIP are kissing on Chip's water bed.
          Chip fumbles for one of those "fragrance plug-ins" and
          PLUGS it into the wall. Needy looks over.

          INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME
          Colin enters the house tentatively. It's dark, vacant,
          and very creepy. There's a very faint glow and soft music
          coming from upstairs.
          
                                     COLIN
                       Yo?
          He stumbles over a stray 2 x 4. There are piles of
          sawdust and building materials everywhere-- the house is
          definitely still under construction. Colin looks
          confused.
          A MOUSE skitters over his sneakers.
                                  COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Jennifer? Anyone there?
          The music upstairs grows slightly louder in response.
          
          Colin squares his shoulders and heads slowly up the
          creaking stairs.
          
                                                                  62.

          Needy has eased off her top to reveal an endearingly
          plain white bra, complete with center bow. CHIP, also
          shirtless, cops a feel.
          He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fluorescent
          orange CONDOM. Needy looks at the wrapper.

          INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - CONTINUOUS
          Colin follows the music into an empty bedroom. The dark
          room is filled with blazing candles melting and pooling
          into bizarre shapes. A single BLANKET is spread out on
          the floor. Colin shivers.
          Behind him, in the doorway, Jennifer appears, her smiling
          face hellishly aglow.
          
                                   JENNIFER
                    You made it.
                                  COLIN
                    What's going on? This isn't really
                    your house, is it?
                                  JENNIFER
                    No baby. This is our house, just
                    for you and me. We can play Mommy
                    and Daddy.
          Colin is totally dumbstruck.
                                  COLIN
                    Do you even know my last name?
                                  JENNIFER
                    Silly. I've been sending you
                    signals all year. Couldn't you
                    tell? You give me such a wettie.

          She starts KISSING Colin on the neck. We can see
          confusion-- and fear-- in his eyes.
          
          INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - SAME
          Chip fumbles below his waist, obviously struggling with
          the condom. Needy leans forward for a closer look.
                                  NEEDY
                    Oh. It's got little bumps on it. I

          INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME
          Jennifer grips Colin's face in her hands and forcibly
          kisses him on the mouth. Colin succumbs, but stiffly.
          We hear a SCRATCHING noise. Colin pulls away
          instinctively and sees MICE and ROACHES emerging from the
          walls, skittering over surfaces.
                                    COLIN
                    Jennifer...
          
          Jennifer looks over her shoulder and giggles.
                                  JENNIFER
                    You scared? I thought boys like
                    you were into vermin.
          
          She unbuttons his jeans. They fall noisily to the floor--
          they're the baggy Hot Topic kind with chains and buckles
          galore.

          Colin into Jennifer's eyes. There's something horrible
          about her face...like she's become almost corpselike.

                    I need you frightened.
          Colin tries to jerk away, but Jennifer easily disengages
          his arm from its socket. A sickeningly moist SNAP. Colin
          cries out in pain.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    I need you hopeless.
          She slams him to the ground and mounts him. Her jaw
          unhinges, opening her mouth to a horrifying, inhuman
          degree. Her teeth are razor-sharp and grotesquely
          crowded, like they belong to some horribly deformed dog.
          She descends on him, feeding ravenously.
          
          We see their shadows against the wall: Jennifer lunging
          hungrily, blood spraying up from Colin's jugular. We can
          hear him screaming and gargling on his own blood.

          CHIP is doggedly pumping away on top of Needy, his eyes
          closed in concentration. Needy's vacant eyes are suddenly

                       Am I too big?
          Tears roll down Needy's cheeks. She begins moaning, then
          SCREAMING at that top of her lungs.
          
          She hallucinates liquid seeping through the walls, blood
          and lymph oozing in at the corners and windows. Then the
          infamous spiny black bile...
          Pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness. Skulls,
          jesters, demons, death. It's the worst acid trip
          imaginable.
          Needy rubs her eyes frantically and continues to scream.

          CHIP immediately rolls off Needy, concerned. He grabs her
          and tries to shake some sense into her.
                                  CHIP (CONT'D)
                    Needy! What's wrong?
          Needy continues to shriek hysterically, her voice growing
          ragged.
          
          INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME
          We can still hear Colin making inhuman sounds of pain. We
          can only see the carnage in shadow, but it's clearly
          unspeakable.
          
          INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          Needy clutches her throat, hyperventilating. She stands
          up and struggles to get dressed. Her breath rasps. Chip
          is freaking out.
                                  CHIP
                    Is it something I did?

          INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME
          
          Colin's thrashing limbs finally go limp. Jennifer is
          hunched over his remains like a jackal scooping blood
          into her mouth with cupped hands.
          We see his eyes, flecked with blood, pupils dilated. A
          white MOUSE crawls over his face.
          
          INT. CHIP'S HOUSE - SAME
          Needy races toward the door with Chip in pursuit.

                    You feel-- What does that even
                    mean? I'm worried about you.

                    I'm so sorry, Chip. I'm so sorry.
                    Everything is just wrong.
          She bolts out the room, leaving Chip naked and alone. He
          pulls his knees up to his chest, vulnerable.
          
          EXT. CHIP'S STREET - SAME
          Needy runs toward her mom's CAR, a beat-up Kia parked on
          the curb.
          She climbs into the car and starts the ignition,
          trembling and crying.
          
          She pulls out onto the street and guns it. She swings a
          hard left. The streets are all almost identical, lined by
          working-class homes.
          She turns on the radio. The song is, of course, "Through
          the Trees" by Soft Shoulder. She pounds the dashboard,
          hysterical.
                                  NEEDY
                    Fudge! Fudge! Maple fudge!
          
          Needy seizes the wheel drives recklessly down a dark,
          tree-lined street. Then, she sees something bright emerge
          from the shadows. Her eyes widen...
          It's JENNIFER, creeping toward the curb like an animal.
          She's pale in the moonlight. The entire lower half of her
          face is covered in blood, like a ghoulish beard of gore.
          She flashes a huge, deranged, toothy SMILE at Needy.
          
          Needy screams and SWERVES. The car fishtails out of
          control and slides into a ditch.
          Needy slams her foot onto the accelerator, trying to get
          out of the trench. She glances desperately out the side
          window. Jennifer is gone.
          Panting, Needy tries to accelerate again.

          CONTINUED:
          
          Suddenly, Jennifer appears from out of nowhere and SLAMS
          her body against the windshield, her long limbs splayed
          like an insect's. The windshield SHATTERS. Jennifer grins
          at Needy through the cracking glass.
          Needy screams again, puts the pedal to the floor, and
          manages to rear up out of the ditch. Jennifer's body
          tumbles off the car as Needy goes roaring down the
          street.

          EXT. NEEDY'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
          Needy throws the car into park and races up the front
          walk. She unlocks the door, shaking and fumbling. She
          bursts into the darkened house.

          No reply. Needy braces herself against the kitchen
          counter and bawls. She falls to her knees and curls up on
          the floor, exhausted.
          
          Her eyes drift shut.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I've always been able to feel what
                    she feels. Just not like this.

          Little Needy and Little Jennifer are playing Barbies in a
          sandbox. Needy holds a brand new, immaculate Barbie doll.
          
                                  LITTLE JENNIFER
                    I'll be Perfect Prom Barbie and
                    you be her.
          
          She tosses Needy a naked brunette doll with its hair
          chopped off and an arm missing.

                    You can be Ugly Ashley or Ken.
                    Choose.
          
          She puts her hand down in the sand emphatically and
          suddenly HOWLS in pain.
          
                                  LITTLE NEEDY
                    What's wrong, Jennifer?
          
          Jennifer lifts her hand. There's a TACK stuck in her palm
          and it's bleeding.
          
                                  LITTLE JENNIFER
                    OWWWWWW!

                          a grown-up)
                    Damn! Ass!
          
          Needy grabs Jennifer's hand, pulls out the tack and wipes
          away the blood. It's still bleeding. Panicking, she leans
          forward and instinctively puts her mouth to the wound.
          
          Jennifer watches quietly. Needy pulls away.
          
                                  LITTLE NEEDY
                    Better. We should get a Band-Aid

          INT. KITCHEN - (BACK TO REALITY)
          Needy WAKES UP in a cold sweat, gasping. She's still on
          the kitchen floor. She peels herself up off the floor,
          disoriented.
          
                                                               69.

          Needy trudges into her dark bedroom. She strips off her
          clothes and stumbles into bed.
                                  JENNIFER'S VOICE
                    What's up, Monistat?
          
          Needy flicks on her bedside lamp, petrified. Jennifer is
          curled up in bed beside her, reclining casually. She's
          freshly showered and wearing one of Needy's dorky T-
          shirts.
          Needy screams at the top of her lungs and leaps out of
          bed, pulling the covers with her.
                                  JENNIFER
                    God, enough screaming already.

                       They're basically agents of Satan
                       with awesome haircuts. I figured

          INT. SOFT SHOULDER'S VAN (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
          
          Jennifer is crouched in the back of the van. None of the
          band members are speaking. Nikolai Wolf drives down a
          gravel road, away from the fire site and deep into the
          woods.

          Jennifer looks around the van, wide-eyed. There's glow-in-
          the-dark Satanic imagery painted all over the walls:
          goats heads, pentagrams, and strange coded writing. She
          sees a few books sliding around on the floor: "Spells and
          Incantations," "Summoning the Beast," and a copy of the
          Black Mass.
          
          Jennifer springs to her feet and tries to escape out the
          side door. MICK, the drummer, grabs her ankles, taking
          her down.

                                  NIKOLAI
                    Told you, Dirk. You owe me a beer.

                    Sure, man.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST CLEARING (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
          
          The van rumbles down an uneven forest path, deep into the
          woods. They arrive at the real Devil's Kettle-- roaring,
          ominous waterfalls. There's a crude stone altar
          illuminated by moonlight.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT
          Needy is still cowering on her bedroom floor, captivated
          by the tale in progress. Jennifer is reclining in the bed
          with a relaxed, supernatural glow.
                                  NEEDY
                    What did they do to you?
                                  JENNIFER
                    Just let me finish. So they drove
                    all the way out to the falls. I
                    tried to figure out an escape, but
                    it was so dark out there...
          
                                                                 72.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. THE FALLS (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
          
          The door of the van slides open. Nikolai pulls Jennifer
          out of the van and hustles her into the clearing. He
          looks up into the sky.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    We got a waxing moon. Perfection.

                    You're the man, Wolf.
          
          The four band members surround Jennifer, looking
          statuesque in their sexy rock n' roll ensembles.
          
          Without warning, Nikolai hauls off and KICKS Jennifer.
          She yelps and falls onto her back on the dirt.
          
          Dirk looks apprehensive.
          
                                  DIRK
                    I don't know if we should go
                    through with this.

                    ritual! God.
          
          Dirk obediently heads over to the van. He pushes the
          intimidating-looking magical books aside and retrieves a
          single folded piece of computer paper.
          
                                     MICK
                    That's it?
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    What? I found it on Google.
          
          He unfolds the piece of paper and clears his throat.

          The guys have dragged Jennifer onto the makeshift altar
          and are holding her down. She struggles and screams, but
          Dirk slaps her again.

                    My name is Jennifer.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    That's fascinating.
          
          Dirk and Mick exchange nervous glances.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    Please let me go. I'll do
                    anything. Anything you want.
          
          Nikolai examines her with an appraising eye.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    I only hump nines and tens. You're
                    a seven at best, even with the
                    chicken cutlets.
          
          He reaches into Jennifer's bra and casually pulls out a
          GEL BREAST ENHANCER, tossing it aside.
          
          Jennifer rears up and SPITS in his artfully rumpled hair.
          Nikolai smooths his `do, enraged.
          
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
                    I'm gonna carve you like a
                    pumpkin, bitch. Don't you know
                    that me and my boys are in league
                    with the Beast himself?
          
          He wiggles his menacingly pointy fingers in her face.

                    We've spent months making
                    offerings to the "man downstairs,"
                    and whaddya know? Satan delivered!
                    We went from college radio to
                    being courted by the majors in two
                    months.

                    But that's not enough, Jenny. We
                    want designer drugs. We want
                    groupies that have their own
                    groupies. We want speedballs and

                    by color. In short, we want more.
                    And to get more, we have to
                    butcher you. And bleed you.

                    Start chanting, boys.
          
          The group begins chanting jibberish in unison. Jennifer
          struggles, watching as their eyes go hollow and black.
          
                                  NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

          He unsheathes a huge, gleaming knife and raises it Psycho-
          style, admiring his reflection in the blade.

                    It's a bowie knife.

                    Bowie. Nice.
          
          Snickering, Nikolai begins to sing "Starman" by David
          Bowie. The group joins in merrily.

          As the group sings, Nikolai brings the knife down with a
          grin. We hear Jennifer SCREAMING, sounds of violence and
          clothes ripping as Nikolai relentlessly beats her and
          stabs her, his face contorting demonically. The band
          continues to sing, their voices carrying over the trees.
          
          Nikolai walks over to where the "devil side" of the falls
          rushes into a black hole. He drops the murder weapon
          into the churning water, smiling.

          Needy's expression is both incredulous and horrified.
          Jennifer is totally matter-of-fact. She picks at her
          nails with a wooden cuticle stick from Needy's night
          stand.

                    the whole time. I could feel them

          Jennifer is wandering down a rural road in a daze. She
          hears a faint COUGH. Jennifer stops and sees a hunched
          FIGURE walking down the opposite side of the street. It's
          AHMET FROM INDIA, the foreign student. He's covered in
          soot and looks traumatized.
          
          Jennifer takes a step. Ahmet takes a step. Jennifer
          stops. Ahmet stops.
          
          Their eyes meet. Jennifer crosses the street. Ahmet
          stares at her, frightened. Jennifer addresses him in a
          quiet, gravelly voice.

          Jennifer jams the CUTICLE STICK into her own forearm and
          drags it through her flesh. Needy screams and covers her
          mouth.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    No biggie. Watch.
          She pulls out the stick. The wound seals over instantly.
          Needy gasps and touches Jennifer's unmarked arm.
          
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    That's some X-Men shit, right?

                    What do you mean, "when you're
                    full"?
                                  JENNIFER
                    You know. Full. Like full of tasty
                    morsels.
          Needy shakes her head, not comprehending.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    Forget it. You'd probably tell on
                    me anyway. Not that anyone would
                    believe you. You always think the
                    world is coming to an end.
                                  NEEDY
                    What about my mom's Kia? Why did
                    you attack me out there? Why were
                    you covered in blood? You didn't
                    even look human.
          Jennifer rolls her eyes.

          She smiles seductively.
          
          Needy crawls further away from her, shivering.
          Jennifer rolls her eyes and gets out of bed. She walks
          over to the second-story window and cranks it open.

                    5000.
          
          She climbs onto the windowsill. Needy watches, confused.
                                  JENNIFER (CONT'D)
                    See you at school.
          She LEAPS gracefully out the window.
          Needy watches in stunned silence for a few moments. Then
          she creeps over to the window and looks out. Nothing
          there but the wind. Jennifer's gone.
          
          EXT. OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL BLOOD CEMETERY - DAY
          We're in a small Catholic cemetery. A small, neat gravel
          path runs through the stately old monuments into a small
          valley where a funeral is taking place.
          
                                                           (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Faint moaning and sobbing can be heard. Then, a
          procession of 6 or 7 GOTH/EMO KIDS appears on the crest
          of the hill. They move forward into the cemetery,
          flamboyantly dressed in black capes, chains, cloaks, neon
          hairpieces, fishnets, mesh, 18-hole combat boots, etc.
          These are Colin Gray's friends.
          
          One girl scatters blood-red rose petals dramatically on
          the path as she stumbles along, weeping.
          At the bottom of the hill, Colin Gray's very conservative-
          looking family stands next to the fresh grave, surrounded
          by sympathetic mourners. NEEDY stands near the back,
          looking shell-shocked. There are also a few press
          photographers snapping photos, and of course, a Catholic
          priest.
                                  PRIEST
                    We gather here today to celebrate
                    the life of Colin Gray, who was
                    plucked from the prime of...
          The priest and family are momentarily distracted by the
          motley crew of Goths descending on the funeral. The
          priest clears his throat disapprovingly.

                    These are Colin's friends.
          A GOTH BOY runs up to the grave and drops to his belly.
                                  GOTH BOY
                    Colin! Take me with you! I belong
                    down there! In the DAAAARKNESS!
                                  GOTH GIRL
                    No, Kevin. Those are just his
                    fleshly remains. He's among the
                    dark angels of the realm now. Fly,
                    Colin. Fly into the firmament.
          She lights a bundle of SAGE and waves it in the air.
          Colin's father gags, appalled.
                                  GOTH BOY
                    Is it cool if we camp here for a
                    few days? We want to commune with
                    his corpse. He was our spooky
                    homeboy.

                    Oh, right. I need to ask you
                    something, Mrs. Gray. It's really
                    important for me to have closure.
                                   PRIEST

                    Is it true that Colin had a date
                    with Jennifer Check the night he
                    was killed?
          
          She says "Jennifer Check" as if it were the most
          disgusting name imaginable. Needy covers her face.
                                  GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)
                    Because Jennifer Check is a social
                    disease. She's not like us. She
                    thinks she's so special just
                    because she's popular and and is
                    what "society" considers
                    "attractive." But she's not
                    sincere. She's about as emo as a
                    breast implant! And she listens to
                    Jessica Simpson and shops at
                    Hollister. And I just know Colin
                    would never go out with someone
                    like that, and I just need
                    confirmation. From you. So did he?
                                  MR. GRAY
                    Did he...?

                    Um, Chloe? Maybe you should be mad
                    at the person who murdered Colin.
                    All Jennifer Check did was invite
                    him over to watch Aquamarine.
                                    GOTH GIRL
                    That's WORSE!
          She throws herself to the ground, crying and pounding the
          dirt like a toddler.
          Colin Gray's mother buries her head in her hands and
          begins weeping. Mr. Gray attempts to comfort her.
          
                                  GOTH BOY
                    Colin wouldn't have liked this.

                         (losing it)
                    Oh, you think so, Powder? Yeah,
                    you're right! I'm pretty sure my
                    son wouldn't have liked being
                    eaten by a fucking CANNIBAL and
                    buried before his eighteenth
                    birthday! Wow, you must have known
                    him so well!
                                    MR. GRAY
                    Jill...
          The goth boy looks terrified. But Mrs. Gray's not done
          ranting yet.
                                   MRS. GRAY
                    By the time they found Colin in
                    that godforsaken house, he looked
                    like lasagna with teeth. I'd know--
                    I had to identify the remains. My
                    boy's not in the realm of the
                    undead. He's not flying around in
                    the firmament with magical wings
                    of flame. He's in an overpriced
                    rosewood box that's headed six
                    feet downtown.
          She kicks the coffin to illustrate.

          The kids stare at her in awe. Needy watches as Mrs. Gray
          collapses into Mr. Gray's arms.
          
          EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - DAY
          Two girls are hanging an homemade banner on the fence
          surrounding the football field. It says "TURNABOUT DANCE
          OCTOBER 5 -- TICKETS ON SALE."
          Needy walks briskly toward school, huddled in her parka.
          She looks totally fucked up, like she hasn't slept in
          days. There are hollows beneath her eyes.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    They did a big memorial assembly
                    for Colin at school, and we had to
                    watch another presentation about
                    curfews and the buddy system and
                    how to deal with grief. But nobody
                    seemed to care anymore. Sorrow was
                    last week's emotion.
          
          We see Jennifer a few yards away, talking and laughing
          with some other flag team members.

                    Jennifer and I hadn't spoken since
                    our encounter in my room.
                    Actually, I hadn't really spoken
                    to anyone. I was busy with
                    research. Paranormal research.
          Needy gazes off into the distance with bloodshot eyes. As
          she stares at Jennifer, she see has a series of brief,
          gruesome HALLUCINATIONS:
          Jennifer as a grinning death mask. Jennifer as a corpse,
          the lower half of her face rotted away. Jennifer as a
          harlequin monster. Needy hears the rush of her own blood,
          the barely audible buzzing of flies...
          Chip jogs up next to her, jolting her out of her reverie.

                       love to for four minutes the other

          Needy and Chip walk to an alley behind the school.
          Melting snow drips off the eaves.
          Needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it. It's
          full of copies from the library and Internet printouts.
          The spine reads "JENNIFER RESEARCH"

                    Are you picking Needy up at her
                    house?

                    Meeting her at the dance. I'm
                    gonna walk. It's so warm outside.
                    It's like 40.

                    I want pictures with your sister

          Needy is fully dressed and garishly made up. Toni holds a
          digital camera at arm's length and takes a shot of the
          two of them together.
          The mother/daughter photo looks ghastly. Toni's eyes are
          closed and Needy pouts miserably.
          
          INT. CHIP'S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - EVENING
          
          Chip's mother snaps a series of stiffly posed photos of
          Chip and his little sister, Camille.
          We can see the PEPPER SPRAY tucked into the interior of
          Chip's jacket.

                    One more. Back to back. Big
                    smiles. Camille, we don't touch
                    ourselves down there. That's our

          INT. KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM (TO ESTABLISH) - NIGHT
          The gym is decorated to look like an enchanted forest. A
          large banner reads "Through the Trees- Turnabout Dance"
          There are streamers and balloons everywhere in sickly
          shades of green and purple.
          
          A DJ plays badly-mixed pop music.
          Couples drift into the gym. The GOTH KIDS who were at
          Colin Gray's grave travel in a pack, sulking.
          The goth girl who loved Colin wanders through the
          decorations and pops every balloon she passes with a pin.
          As she pops them, she narrates dramatically.
                                  GOTH GIRL
                         (popping balloon)
                    This is my heart.

                    My soul.
          
                                  GOTH GIRL (CONT'D)
                         (popping balloon)
                    Everything I once believed in.
          Another GOTH GIRL, looking exasperated, grabs a balloon,
          shoves it under her babydoll dress and pops it.
                                   GOTH GIRL #2
                         (MOCKINGLY)
                    Your abortion.
          
          She rapidly shoves another one under her dress and pops
          it again, smirking.
                                  GOTH GIRL #2 (CONT'D)
                    Your other abortion.
                                  GOTH GIRL
                    I hate your guts, Madison.
          The girls glare at each other.
          
          Needy walks in, looking small and apprehensive in her bad
          `80s dress. She looks around for Chip, but he's not there
          yet. A few mean kids point at her dress and snicker.
          Needy ladles some juice into a paper cup and leans
          against the wall, waiting anxiously for her Prince
          Charming.
          
                                                                  91.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS
          Chip is cutting through the park on his way to the dance.
          He whistles to himself.
          Across the park, he sees a STRAY DOG trotting toward him.
          The dog pants aggressively. CHIP tries to smile, but
          looks uncomfortable.
          A few SQUIRRELS emerge from the trees, gazing curiously
          at him.
          
          INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS
          Couples are beginning to grind against each other on the
          dance floor. Needy watches them longingly. She checks her
          Mickey Mouse watch.
          
          EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS
          Chip picks up the pace, jogging down the path. In the
          distance behind him we can barely make out Jennifer's
          form. She looks more spectral then we've ever seen her.
          
          Chip speeds up instinctively.
          Suddenly, Jennifer's about ten paces closer.
          Then she's closer again, as if she can fold space and
          time. She's ethereal, flickering.
          CHIP turns to look over his shoulder.
          
          INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS
          The music fades out and there's a squeal of feedback from
          the sound system. Mr. Wroblewski walks onto the stage in
          a bad suit. He awkwardly picks up the mic with his one
          good hand and pats it with his robotic one.
                                  MR. WROBLEWSKI
                    Can I have everyone's attention
                    please?
          The students turn to look at him, annoyed by the
          distraction.

                    Cran-Grape that were so generously
                    donated by the Parents Club.

                    But the real treat is yet to come.
                    It's happening right about now,
                    this treat of which I speak. We
                    have some very special guests
                    tonight. They were kind enough to
                    take a break from their sold-out
                    national tour and play our dance
                    for free.
          
          Needy gags on her juice.

          CHIP makes an incoherent noise and jumps as Jennifer
          appears, improbably, right in front of him. She's wearing
          a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect.

                    night Colin Gray died. But that's
                    not just because he was brutally
                    murdered and stuff. It's
                    because....I don't wanna say this.

                    figured Needy was busy jumping
                    your jock that night, so I agreed
                    to a little pity date. Colin
                    brought me to that empty house so
                    we could have some privacy. But he
                    wanted to go too far, so I left

          all their glory. Success has treated them well-- they're
          glowing and wearing designer rock n' roll couture. They
          look like the young Rolling Stones.
          Needy drops her cup. Juice splatters onto the ground.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                    Good evening, babies. Are you
                    ready for some bad vibrations?
          
          The students rush the stage, shrieking. Nikolai raises
          his fist and the band launches into a heavy, uptempo
          version of "Through the Trees."
          Needy looks as though she's had a revelation. A look of
          pure horror crosses her face.

          She rushes toward the gym exit, tripping in her high
          heels.
          
          EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS
          CHIP is hypnotized in the glow of the streetlights.
          Jennifer leans forward and kisses him on the neck
                                  JENNIFER
                    Needy didn't deserve a boy like
                    you.
          
          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
          Needy is running toward the park in her gown. She takes
          off her shoes and tosses them aside, her arms and legs
          pumping furiously.

                    One thing people don't know about
                    me is that I'm fast. I just never
                    went out for track because I look
                    bad in shorts. Also, Jennifer told
                    me track was for lezzies. But I
                    am. Fast, I mean. Even in that
                    fucking afterbirth of a dress, I
                    could really tear up the asphalt.
          
          She picks up the pace, cheeks puffing.

          INT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS
          Jennifer is kissing Chip. She pulls him down onto the
          damp, muddy grass.

                    This feels weird. Can we go

                    I have just the place.
          
          She stands up and starts to lead Chip toward an
          abandoned, fenced-off COMMUNITY POOL. It's drained and
          spooky and looks dangerous.

                    Murphy Pool? I don't think we can
                    go in there. I knew some skater
                    guys who went in there. They got
                    in big trouble and now they have
                    to pick up garbage for 100 hours.
          Jennifer giggles and pulls him along.

                    You're in big trouble anyway. Come
                    on.
          
          She begins to climb the chain link fence.
          
          EXT. CHIP'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          Needy jogs toward CHIP's house. Exhausted and sweaty, she
          presses the doorbell. She falls to her knees on the front
          stoop, panting and wheezing.

          licks a Popsicle.
          CHIP's mother appears and shoves Camille aside.

          EXT. MURPHY POOL - SAME
          Murphy Pool is even eerier from the inside. The fenced-in
          deck area is littered with garbage, abandoned pool
          furniture and graffiti. Someone has spray painted the
          word "HOPELESS" on a wall.
          CHIP shivers and looks around nervously.
          
          Jennifer nonchalantly unzips her dress and shimmies out
          of it, revealing her bra and panties.

                    Never, Trevor. I'm hot like magma.
          She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to
          climb down the ladder on the side. The pool is full of
          filthy, freezing water.

                    The water looks disgusting.

          Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees.
          He leans in and kisses Jennifer, who's still clinging to
          the ladder.
          The sound of buzzing flies grows louder.
          Suddenly, Jennifer opens her eyes. She hooks her arm
          around Chip's neck and lunges backward. They tumble off
          the ladder, into the pool. Chip SCREAMS.
          
          INT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS

          Needy whips around, hikes up her skirt and starts running
          toward Murphy Pool.
          
          She reaches the fence and starts climbing it. She slips
          and cuts her hand on a broken link.
          CHIP screams again on the other side of the fence.

          She flings herself over the top of the fence, her body

          It's a compound fracture, the bone thrusting through the
          flesh of her arm as she screams.
          
          INT. MURPHY POOL - CONTINUOUS
          Needy staggers toward the pool, which is surrounded by an
          extraterrestrial glow. Chip's moaning is almost
          unbearable. Needy stares into the abyss and claps her
          hands over her mouth.
          
          Jennifer is waist deep in the DIRTY WATER, flinging Chip
          against the wall like a rag doll. He's still conscious,
          but his skin on his chest has been RIPPED OFF to expose
          his ribs. Jennifer is CHEWING happily.
          Chip looks at Needy, his face a mask of agony.

          Jennifer begins gnawing on Chip's neck, so engaged in the

          Needy climbs up on the diving board and crosses herself.

          Jennifer looks up with demonic, bloodshot eyes just as
          Needy leaps off the diving board.
          Needy lands on Jennifer's shoulders, taking her out. She
          wraps her legs around Jennifer's neck and drags her under
          the water.
          Jennifer emerges. Needy grabs her by the hair and girly-
          slaps her furiously across the face. Then she spots the
          PEPPER SPRAY lying by the side of the pool. She grabs it
          and sprays it in Jennifer's eyes. Jennifer shrieks and
          vomits NASTY, SPINY GORE all over Needy and Chip.

          Jennifer ROCKETS straight up into the air like a goddess,

          Jennifer speaks in a metallic, demonic-sounding voice.
          
                                  JENNIFER
                    God, do you have to undermine

          Jennifer floats in midair toward the pool deck and drifts
          down, landing on her feet. Needy crawls out of the pool
          and faces her down.
                                  JENNIFER

          Her voice is now an unearthly growl. In the background,
          Chip is slowly, painfully pulling a POOL SKIMMER with an
          eight-foot handle off the pool deck.

          She HURTLES herself toward Needy, roaring, her eyes white-
          hot, her jaws agape. She's monstrous.
          Chip suddenly stumbles in front of Needy and holds the
          HANDLE of the POOL SKIMMER in front of them like a spear.
          As Jennifer flies forward at demonic speed, she IMPALES
          HER ENTIRE TORSO on the handle.
          Needy screams. There's a beat of deafening silence.

          Chip collapses on the pool deck.
          Jennifer rises uncertainly to her feet, "shishkebabbed"
          on the giant skimmer. With effort, she pulls the handle
          out of her body in several stages.

          She smirks and jumps over the fence, stumbling off into

          hate.
          Once Jennifer has disappeared, Needy turns her attention
          to Chip, who is barely alive. She stares in horror at his
          torn arm and exposed ribs, then falls to her knees over
          his body.

          cell phone. She wipes off the prickly ooze with her hand.

          Needy dials to no avail. The phone is hopelessly clogged

          into the gym.
          
          INT. GYM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Needy enters the gym and slams the door shut behind her.
          People ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage.
          They're too busy slow dancing and laughing in their
          respective cliques.
          She looks up at the stage, where Soft Shoulder are
          playing an insufferably long coda.
          
          Nikolai noodles through a guitar solo, then looks up and
          sees Needy looking directly at him, her eyes full of
          hate.
          Nikolai gulps nervously and elbows Dirk.
          
          Needy points to her eyes with two fingers, then points at
          Nikolai, as if to say, Gotcha. She looks completely
          possessed.
          
                                  NIKOLAI
                         (to Dirk)
                    We gotta get out of here.
                                   DIRK
                    Why?
                                  NIKOLAI
                    I think this girl's flipping out.
          
                                  DIRK
                    What could she do to us?
          
                                   NIKOLAI
                    Look at her.
          Dirk takes one look at Needy's face and takes off his
          guitar. Nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave
          the stage. The music stops abruptly. The kids in the gym
          murmur and complain, confused.
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Needy tries to follow them. She limps blindly toward the
          stage and climbs up. Everyone watches, gasping in horror.
          By now the band is disappearing out the side door of the
          gym.
                                  NEEDY
                         (into the mic)
                    You didn't play your hit yet.
          But they're gone.
          Needy looks out at her classmates. They stare back. She
          PASSES OUT COLD.
          
          INT. CHIP'S STREET - MORNING (TO ESTABLISH)
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    They found Chip the following
                    morning. The police couldn't find
                    an explanation for the "substance"
                    in the pool, so they chose not to
                    mention it to the press. In fact,
                    they treated the whole incident
                    like a bad dream.
          
          
          INT. CHIP'S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - MORNING
          We see the POLICE (including newly minted officer ROMAN
          DUDA) informing Chip's mother that his body has been
          found. She collapses onto the floor, curling up into the
          fetal position.
                                   NEEDY
                    Trouble was, some of us would
                    never wake up.
          
          INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM - DAY
          Needy is lying in bed, shaking, her arm in a cast. Her
          mother tries to rouse her.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I never went back to school after
                    that. Didn't talk much either. My
                    mom bought some books so she could
                    teach me at home like crazy
                    Christians with 14 kids do. But I
                    wasn't a very cooperative student.
          
          Needy pulls the covers over her head.
          
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Toni shrugs, resigned, and tosses the book on the floor.
          
          EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          Needy is crouched outside Jennifer's window, hiding in
          the shrubbery. She looks almost feral, with wide eyes and
          a hungry expression.
          Through the window, we see Jennifer sitting at a vanity
          and combing her hair, oblivious to the intruder in her
          yard.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    What nobody realized was that I
                    was doing a different kind of
                    homework. I was watching her every
                    night. Waiting.
          We see Jennifer putting the comb down and examining her
          hair with a appraising eye.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    Waiting for her to get weak and
                    dull. Waiting for her to burn
                    through the life-force she'd
                    stolen from Chip.
          
          Needy creeps away from the window.
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    It took weeks, but I finally made
                    my move. Remember?
          
          
          EXT. JENNIFER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          We're seeing a FLASHBACK of the night Needy slaughtered
          Jennifer.
          Needy plunging through the window. Jennifer thrashing.
          The blood. The struggle. The levitation. The arrival of
          the police.
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    Even in her last moments of life,
                    she somehow managed to be cooler
                    than me.
          
          We see, for a moment, Jennifer's sly, challenging smile
          as Needy raises the boxcutter to slash her. That
          signature look of mastery and control.
          
          
                                                         (CONTINUED)
          
                                                              111.

                                  NEEDY
                    She left an insanely hot corpse.
          
          We see Jennifer's mother holding her again, screaming,
          though all we hear is SILENCE and STATIC. Sure enough,
          Jennifer's bleeding body seems to be artfully, sensually
          draped in her mother's arms. She almost seems to be
          SMIRKING at us.
          
          INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT
          We're back in solitary confinement, where Needy has been
          narrating the whole sordid tale. She hasn't moved a
          muscle since beginning her story. Only a single shaft of
          moonlight illuminates the room.
          
          An orderly shoves DINNER through a slot in the door. It's
          a pile of mystery meat. Needy wrinkes her nose.
          
                                  NEEDY V.O.
                    I don't even know who Needy
                    Lesnicki is anymore. I'm a
                    different person now. A person who
                    uses curse words and kicks
                    orderlies and and sees things that
                    aren't there. A very bad, very
                    damaged person.
          
          Needy reaches up and distractedly pulls back the neckline
          of her shirt...
          
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    But sometimes, change can be good.
                    For instance, most occult scholars
                    don't know this, but if you're
                    bitten by a demon--and you live--
                    you just might absorb some of the
                    demon's abilities.
          In the moonlight, we see Needy still has a infected-
          looking BITEMARK near her shoulder. She scratches it,
          wincing.
                                  NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D)
                    You just might get lucky for once
                    in your miserable life.
          
          PULL BACK to reveal that Needy, still cross-legged is
          HOVERING five feet off the floor. Effortlessly.
          With visible concentration, she slowly flies up toward a
          narrow WINDOW positioned up near the ceiling. To anyone
          with normal abilities, it would be impossible to access.
                                                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Needy reaches the window, gazes at it for a moment, then
          SMASHES it with surprising strength.
          
          EXT. LEECH LAKE HOSPITAL - FIVE MINUTES LATER
          Needy strolls across the grounds in her bunny slippers.
          She heads confidently toward the SECURITY FENCE and
          passes through it after casually mangling the bars. Only
          a Needy-shaped hole remains.
          
          EXT. COUNTY ROAD 9 - TEN MINUTES LATER
          Needy is striding purposefully down a dark country road.
          The hospital recedes in the background.
          A few RACCOONS gather by the side of the road, watching
          Needy as she walks past.
          
          A PICKUP TRUCK whizzes by with its windows rolled down.
          "Through the Trees" blasts from the radio.
          Needy begins to sing, a lopsided grin on her face.
          
                                  NEEDY

                    you. Heal the ruins left inside
                    you..."
          
          EXT. MURPHY POOL - NIGHT
          
          Devil's Kettle citizens are gathered around Murphy Pool,
          crying. It's a CANDLELIGHT MEMORIAL for Chip. Their faces
          are weary and sorrowful. Photos of Chip have been
          arranged around the edge of the fence. We see a picture
          of CHIP AND NEEDY on the end.
          Someone has brought a CD player, and the mourners sing
          along, their voices soaring.
                                  VIGIL ATTENDEES
                         (SINGING)
                    "...And the stars will remind you,
                    we'll meet again..."
          
          EXT. COUNTY ROAD 9 - CONTINUOUS
          Needy holds her thumb aloft as she walks down the remote
          country highway.
          
                                                          (CONTINUED)

                    "...We'll meet again."
          A small creek emptying into a stream   runs parallel to the
          road. Needy seems something glinting   at the mouth of the
          creek and stoops to pick it up. It's   Nikolai's BOWIE
          KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's   Kettle, never to be
          seen again.
          Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband.
          A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road. Needy sticks
          her thumb out again.
          The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver,
          a grizzled older man, rolls down the window. He eyes
          Needy lasciviously.
          
                                  OLD MAN
                    Where you looking to go, young
                    lady?
                                  NEEDY
                    East, toward Madison.

                       East, huh? Guess I'm headed that
                       way. But I'm gonna need you to pay
                       me in ass, gas or grass. Got that?
                       No free rides in this wagon.
                                     NEEDY
                       I don't have any money or drugs,
                       so you'll have to settle for ass.
          
                                     OLD MAN
                       Fair enough. Hop in my chariot.
          Needy gratefully hurries into the driver's seat.

                       So why you headed East?

          Needy smiles blithely and pops the clear Lifesaver into
          her mouth.
          The station wagon pulls off. As it sputters off into the
          distance, we see a road sign that reads, ironically, SOFT
          SHOULDER.
          
          We hear the song on the radio end, segueing into the DJ's
          bumper.
                                   RADIO DJ
                    What a song. Thought we'd play
                    that one in honor of Soft
                    Shoulder. They're playing in
                    Madison tonight. Should be a night
                    to remember...
          The DJ's voice fades out as the car vanishes into the
          horizon.

              KID ON BASKETBALL COURT
 
              A puberty-ravaged kid dribbles a basketball, stares straight
              at us.

                        In Indiana -- Clark Hodd.  13.
                        The best point guard in the
                        country. Puberty hasn't been easy.
 
              Discreetly, his hand slips into his pants and scratches.
 
              Girl on a high dive she's poised.  A faraway look in her eyes.

              He swats a pitch -- not out of the park, it's much sweeter
              than that.  He drills it over the first baseman's head, just
              out of reach of his glove. Art runs to first, laughing.  Pats
              the first baseman's butt.  Gotcha.

              A wall of new NFL merchandise.  Television monitors blink
              with the latest endorsement films. Into frame moves JERRY
              MAGUIRE, 35.  He walks briskly and smoothly, yellow legal
              tablet in hand, at home in this lobby filled with Athletes
              and Sports Team Owners.  We hear Herb Alpert's epic
              instrumental, "The Lonely Bull."

              Jerry sits in a red leather chair, across from an agitated

              INT. SMI CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
 
              The SMI agents are a fierce, happy bunch.  They sit in a
              carefully appointed conference room.
 
              Sports photos and posters are framed on the walls.  The signs
              of global marketing are omnipresent.  Each agent has a silver
              tray containing soft drinks and a glass pitcher of water.
              Through the glass window, we see a large office divided up
              into many cubicles.


                                                                     4.

              Near the end of the table sits Jerry Maguire.  The word
              "millions" appears often and easily in his conversation.

              INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE -- HOUSTON -- DAY
 
              An unmarked car pulls into the underground parking facility
              of the Houston Police Department.  A cluster of chattering
              media members move in on the car. ("Baja!!"  "Baja, over
              here!!")  Back doors open, and out steps Jerry Maguire with
              huge offensive lineman, BOBBY "BAJA" BRUNARD, 22.  He is
              angry, and he is handcuffed.

                        fired the shot in the 7/l1?
 
              Jerry whips in between Baja and the taunting media, blocking
              him off and forcing him through the glass doors into the
              police department.  Professional smile in place, Maguire
              attempts spin.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen, there's no proof of
                        anything except that this guy is
                        a sensational athlete.
 
              In the background, we hear baja bellowing insults at the
              press.
 
              INT. ATLANTA RED CARPET ROOM -- ANOTHER DAY
 
              Jerry now sits next to a towering white 27 year-old
              basketball player with a bad haircut. He is CALVIN NACK.
              They are signing a contract in the airport lounge. A little
              BOY approaches the player with a basketball trading card.
 
                                  LITTLE BOY
                        Are you Calvin Nack?  Could you
                        sign my card?

              Nack bends down with a kindly-looking face.
 
                                  CALVIN NACK
                        I'm sorry little fella.  I can't
                        sign that particular brand of
                        card.  I can only sign Pro-Jam
                        Blue Dot cards.
 
              The Little Boy looks confused. As Calvin Nack turns to grab
              an orange juice from a barmaid, Jerry smoothly dishes off a
              business card to the little boy.

              INT. HOSPITAL BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Hockey Player STEVE REMO, 33, is a big man in a small bed.
              He is in traction, with concussion.  DOCTOR stands nearby,
              shoots Jerry a look of concern.  Family is nearby.
 
                                  DOCTOR
                        Do you know your name?
 
                                  STEVE REMO
                        I uh... wait.  Wait, here it
                        comes. I have it.  My name is
                        Steve Remo. I play for the
                        Blackhawks.

                        You are my son.  This pretty lady
                        is my wife.  And you are...
 
              Jerry nods encouragingly, presents his best "familiar" face.
 
                                  STEVE REMO

                        And I gotta play this weekend,
                        Doc. If I play in 65% of the
                        games, I make my bonus.
 
              EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Remo's 14 year-old SON (JESSE) confronts Jerry outside the
              hospital room. He's a hulking kid, a Pop Warner football
              player himself. His voice is in the process of changing.


                                                                     6.
 
 
                                  SON
                        This is his fourth concussion.
                        Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?
 
              As he talks, Jerry's cellular phone rings in his bag.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (glib, easy)
                        Come on -- it'd take a tank to
                        stop your dad.  It would take all
                        five Super Trooper VR Warriors,
                        right?
 
              The kid stares at Maguire.  It feels as if the kid is peering
              into his soul... and all he sees is trash.
 
                                  SON
                        Fuck you.
 
              The kid turns and exits in disgust.  He leaves Jerry standing
              in the hallway.  Devastated. Music.
 
              EXT. RENTAL CAR SHUTTLE -- DAY
 
              Jerry Maguire upset in a rental shuttle.  Passing through
              frame. Music.  Phone still ringing.
 
              INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
 
              Jerry sleeps.

                        Two nights later in Miami at our
                        corporate conference, a

                        Breakthrough.
 
              Jerry's eyes open.  Breathing strangely.  Trembling, he holds
              onto the nightstand for grounding.
 
              He gets up, takes a few gulps of air, walks to mini-bar.
              Gathers some tiny ice cubes in his hand, smears them across
              his face.  This feeling is new to him.

                        It was the oddest, most unexpected
                        thing.  I began writing what they
                        call a Mission Statement for my
                        company. You know -- a Mission
                        Statement -- a suggestion for the
                        future.


                                                                     7.
 
 
              INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry types, a pot of coffee and tray of room service nearby.
              we watch his face, alive now.
 
              There is a direct line from the deepest part of him to the
              words he's typing.  His fingers fly.  Even his eyes grow
              moist.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        What started out as one page
                        became twenty-five. Suddenly I was
                        my father's son.  I was
                        remembering the simple pleasures
                        of this job, how I ended up here
                        out of law school, the way a
                        stadium sounds when one of my
                        players performs well on the
                        field... I was remembering even
                        the words of the late Dicky Fox,
                        the original sports agent, who
                        said:
 
              SHOT OF DICKY FOX
 
                                  DICKY FOX
                        The key to this job is personal
                        relationships.
 
              As Jerry continues typing, his voice is excited now.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        And suddenly it was all pretty
                        clear. The answer was fewer
                        clients.  Caring for them, caring
                        for ourselves, and the games too.
                        Starting our lives, really.
 
              SHOT OF SENTENCE:  We must embrace what is still virginal
              about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly
              clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we
              must simply be the best versions of ourselves... that
              goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear.
 
              He pauses, and wipes his eyes, still considering the sentence.

                        Hey, I'll be the first to admit
                        it. What I was writing was
                        somewhat "touchy feely."
 
              He deletes it.  And then -- zip -- he restores it and
              continues on, boldly.

                        I didn't care.  I had lost the
                        ability to bullshit.  It was the
                        me I'd always wanted to be.
 
              INT. KINKO'S COPIES -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in T-shirt stands proudly watching copies pumped out.
              Wired college students, band guys, other Copy People of the
              Night nearby.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        I printed it up in the middle of
                        the night, before I could re-think
                        it.
 
              Industrial, multi-pierced Kinko's copy guy examines the first
              printed copy of the Mission Statement.  He nods approvingly,
              taps his heart in tribute.  He slides a copy across the
              counter, for Jerry's approval.

                        That's how you become great, man.
                        You hang your ba11s out there.
 
              Jerry nods.  It's 3 AM, and this guy sounds and looks like a
              prophet.  In fact, everyone in Kinko's at 3 AM does.
 
                                  JERRY

              being stuffed into mail-slots.
 
              INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
 
              Jerry splashes water onto his face.  The sun is coming up.
              He looks younger, lighter.
 
              ON TV MOVIE  (JERRY WATCHING)
 
              Suddenly, dramatic movie score.  It's Dana Andrews, showing
              Gene Tierney the newspaper reports of her death in Laura.
              ("Someone was murdered in this room last night... any idea
              who it was?")  Camera whips to Jerry, standing watching as he
              packs.  A slight concern on his face.  He moves to the phone,
              and dials with urgency.


                                                                     9.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi, it's jerry maguire.  Uh,
                        listen did those manuscripts
                        get... Oh they did... No no no no
                        no, that's fine...
 
              INT. ELEVATOR -- DAY
 
                                  JERRY
                        Jerry in suit, alone with his
                        luggage.  Dry throat. clammy,
                        holds onto the handrail to steady
                        himself.
 
              INT. LOBBY -- DAY
 
              The lobby is filled with SMI agents.  The blue Mission
              Statement is in evidence everywhere.  Jerry inconspicuously
              turns the corner, yearns to blend in.  It's impossible, the
              recognition ripples through the lobby.  Underling agent BOB
              SUGAR, 25, is the first to grab Maguire by the shoulders.
              ("Finally, someone said it!") Suddenly another agent begins
              to clap, then reluctantly, another. Soon, the ovation rocks
              the lobby.  (In a three-shot near the front desk, we see a 26
              year-old female employee of SMI applauding with Mission
              Statement in hand, her sleepy son at her side.)  Jerry
              motions for them all to stop, but clearly he could listen
              forever. It is a watershed moment in his life.

                        I was 35.  I had started my life.
 
              Swing off Maguire to find two agents standing clapping
              enthusiastically near the elevator. One offers gum to the
              other.
 
                                  AGENT # 1 (RACHEL)

              folding up into a plane, as music and credits end.
 
              INT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS -- NIGHT
 
              We move past a snoring businessman, onto tired but
              adrenalized Jerry Maguire.  He sits in first-class, working
              on his laptop, a pile of newspapers and magazines nearby.
              The WOMAN PASSENGER next to him, 3oish, finishes up a spicy
              phone conversation with her boyfriend.


                                                                     10.
 
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Monkeyface... monkeyface,
                        listen... I'm not going to say it
                        here.... no...
 
              Jerry continues to work, as his laptop now beeps.  Battery's
              low.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (continuing)
                        ...  oh listen, I got you the
                        perfect white shirt, at this out
                        of the way place... no... quit
                        trying to make me say it!
 
              Jerry shuts off his laptop and prepares for sleep.  Trying
              not to listen.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (continuing)
                        how about if I do it and don't say
                        it... mmmm... see you soon...
 
              She laughs seductively and hangs up.  She is still buzzed
              from the conversation.  Jerry turns to her, surprising her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I have to ask.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (protective)
                        What --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Where'd you find the perfect white
                        shirt?
 
              She laughs, it's an infectious laugh -- two strangers
              enjoying the good life -- as we DRIFT BACK three rows, past
              the panel separating the cool comfort of first class from the
              stuffy airless and uncomfortable world of coach.
 
              We meet DOROTHY BOYD, 26.  A harried passenger on this bus in
              the sky.  Her clothes are part-contemporary, part mother-
              functional. She is never as composed or in control as she
              wants to be. Right now she is devoted to the sneezing kid in
              the wrinkled white-shirt sitting next to her.  It is RAY, her
              five-year old son.  Dorothy is covered in toys and books.
              Stuffed into the side pocket is Jerry's Mission Statement.
              The easy laughter from three rows ahead washes over her like
              cold water, as she rings again for a Flight Attendant.  The
              overworked ATTENDANT arrives, pissed, snapping off the bell.


                                                                     11.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Look, my son is allergic to the
                        material in these blankets -
 
                                  ATTENDANT
                        That's all we have.
 
              The Attendant offers a bundle of soggy cocktail napkins and
              is about to exit as Ray makes a gagging noise.  He's about to
              get sick. Both women reach for an airsick bag, and get it to
              his mouth just in time. Their faces are now inches apart.
 
                                  ATTENDANT
                               (continuing)
                        I'm sorry I was rude just then --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's okay.  We're in it together
                        now...
 
              The Attendant now exits helpfully with the bag.
 
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Don't take anything I say
                        seriously! I love to flirt!
 
              Dorothy, irritated, leans out into the aisle to look for the
              heads that belong to these voices.
 
              BACK TO JERRY AND WOMAN
 
                                  WOMAN
                        You're with the sports people on

                        Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing
                        the Coke commercials for the
                        playoffs.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well.  Good luck with that --
 
              He nods, as he reaches up to shut off the light.  Politely
              stifles another yawn.  He shuts his eyes, settles into sleep.
              Bobbi leans into his darkness.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Can I just get a quick "man's"
                        opinion from you on something?
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT.  FIRST CLASS SEATS -- LATER
 
              Bobbi is intense now, unburdening, as tired Jerry listens
              like a priest.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        And I can't say his name without
                        laughing I want to eat him up. I
                        want to say goodbye to every bad
                        thought I ever had about
                        relationships.  I mean, I crave
                        this guy... and yet... why... why
                        did I have that affair this
                        weekend?  Does that mean I'm not
                        in love with my boyfriend?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think you'll know when you see
                        him at the gate.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        It's the death rattle of my
                        singlehood, right? Because I
                        finally see the white picket fence
                        looming and I love it/hate it/love
                        it/hate it/ love it... you're
                        right, I'll know when I see him.
                        Why is it so easy to talk with
                        you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
 
              Maguire fights another yawn.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I uh... don't think we're quite at
                        your pitch yet.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Tell me, and then you can sleep.

                        every moment of her life, which is
                        why I should take a nap now...
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              Her sleeping son now silent, she can't help but listen.

                               (impatient)
                        Oh, tell the story.

                        --so our first date, she told me
                        about her favorite place in the
                        world, the seven pools of Hana on

                        A year-and-a-half later, we were
                        both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl.
                        Now I've always hit a wall at 18
                        months.  Every serious girlfriend
                        lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka-
                        boom.  The curse of 18 months.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        That's when you need to cement,
                        and define define define.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Exactly.  And the world does not
                        need another 35 year-old bachelor.
                        I knew I wanted to propose, so I
                        took her there.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        To the pools?
 
                                  JERRY
                        To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock
                        Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock
                        Climber, but we're hiking up
                        through the pools and there's a
                        fine mist in the air, and I have
                        the ring in my pocket, and I'm a
                        little nervous, I'm lagging
                        behind, and she says to me, get
                        this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh no --


                                                                     14.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, it bothered me somewhat.
                        And I got quiet.  And now she's
                        quiet and we're both pouting a
                        little, you know.  And I decide
                        I'm not going to propose.  The
                        mood is not right. Why be
                        impulsive? Now at this point I
                        know she knows that I was going to
                        propose and didn't.  And she knows
                        I know.  So the entire sixty mile
                        ride back to the airport, we don't
                        speak. And we're both good at
                        that.  We fly to Honolulu in
                        silence.  We check into the Pro
                        Bowl hotel --
 
                                  WOMAN
                        How sad --
 
                                  JERRY
                        But wait...
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              She is now craning out into the aisle to hear this story.
              The plane is now quieter.  She listens to the easy sound of
              Jerry discussing his charmed life.
 
                                  RAY
                               (waking up)
                        Mama --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Shhh.  Mommy's eavesdropping.
 
              He sneezes, three big ones in a row.  She hands him more
              kleenex, riveted on the story.  And listens.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Now little do I know that my
                        assistant. has assumed that I've
                        now proposed. So she has gotten
                        the lounge band to actually play
                        "Here Comes The Bride" when we
                        walk back in.
 
              Dorothy laughs to herself, somewhat derisively.  She tries to
              share the laugh with her son, who stares at her.


                                                                     15.
 
 
              BACK TO JERRY -- LATER
 
                                  JERRY
                        Which they do.  And we're standing
                        there. All the football guys are
                        in the lobby, watching, there's
                        even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to
                        her and sort of grandly say,
                        "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking
                        you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to
                        marry me." And I took out the
                        ring, and I don't much like big
                        scenes, but she said "yes" right
                        there in the lobby and some of the
                        toughest men in football wept like
                        babies.  We're getting married in
                        February.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Jerry.  You two will be together
                        forever.
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              She takes one of her son's kleenex sheets, as an elegant
              Flight Attendant shuts the curtain to first class. Dorothy
              blows her nose, moved against her will.
 
                                  RAY
                        What's wrong, mom?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        First class is what's wrong.  It
                        used to be a better meal.  Now
                        it's a better life.
 
              She pulls out the Mission Statement,  aware that she's been
              listening to its author.  She opens it and begins to read.
 
              INT. LAX AIRPORT TERMINAL -- MORNING
 
              Jerry Maguire exits the plane a few steps behind Bobbi Fallon.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (quietly, like a
                                coach)
                        You'll know when you see him.
                        You'll know when you see him.
 
              Bobbi scans the crowd. She spots Monkeyface, large and burly
              in tiger-print sweats.  He looks like Mickey Dolenz.  He
              holds flowers.


                                                                     16.
 
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh my God, you're right.  I know.
                               (Jerry smiles)
                        He's not The One.  He's not the
                        One.
 
              Jerry's face falls.  Bobbi Fallon moves into the embrace,
              faking it.  Jerry moves ahead, turning back to see the doomed
              couple. Melancholy now, he continues forward through the
              crowded airport and the expectant faces of those waiting for
              loved ones.  Music.
 
              INT. LUGGAGE AREA -- MORNING
 
              Dorothy looks through the rubber flaps of the luggage
              conveyor belt.  She clutches a cup of coffee.  In the
              background, other SMI agents' grab their bags and exit.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Ray! Ray!
 
              Maguire enters picture, joining her as she looks into the
              dark depths behind the flaps.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Can I help?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office.
                        I was on the junket to the
                        conference. I'm --
 
                                  JERRY
                        I know who y6u are.  You're
                        Dorothy Boyd.  You're in...
                        wait... you're in Accounts.  You
                        have the middle cubicle toward the
                        back with that poster of Albert
                        Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0
                        Neal's body.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (surprised)
                        Hmm.  Pretty good.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now what did you lose?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        My son... my mind...
 
              Over her shoulder, Maguire sees Ray rounding the corner,
              riding the luggage conveyor belt like Washington crossing the
              Delaware.


                                                                     17.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, while I go look for him, why
                        don't you hang onto this curious
                        gentleman behind you --
 
              Dorothy turns, is greatly relieved to see Ray, and snatches
              him off the belt.  She bends down into his face.  She speaks
              softly but intensely, with no frills.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Remember "imagination?"...
                        remember what that means?  Well,
                        this is one of my bosses so you
                        will now IMAGINE me screaming at
                        you right now. Do NOT do that
                        again.  Ever ever EVER.
 
              She rises, shifting back to being a somewhat relaxed young
              woman of 26.  It's a transition she makes, oh, 500 times a
              day.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Well, thanks.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, take care.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        And have fun at your bachelor
                        party.
 
              Jerry pauses just a moment, but it's long enough.  Dorothy
              freezes.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Oh no.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no. I knew.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (slow sigh)
                        Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm just... anxiously looking
                        past it.  I already had my
                        bachelor party.  It was called "my
                        twenties." See you later.
 
              Jerry takes off.


                                                                     18.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I loved your memo, by the way.
 
              He stops.  Turns.  She flashes the well-thumbed copy in her
              purse. Jerry takes a step closer, interested and flattered.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks... actually, it was just a
                        "Mission Statement."
 
              Ray has taken Jerry's free hand, and begun swinging on him.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I think in this age, optimism like
                        that... it's a revolutionary act.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (eager for feedback)
                        You think so?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh tsht. Yes.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I appreciate that, because some of
                        that stuff... you know, it was two
                        in the morning and...
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        -- the part about "we should
                        embrace what it is still virginal
                        about our enthusiasm" --
 
              Jerry looks slightly edgy at the naked vulnerability of his
              words.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        -- "and we should all force open
                        the tightly-clenched fist of
                        commerce, and give a little back
                        for the greater good.". I mean, I
                        was inspired, and I'm an
                        accountant.  Ray, don't spill my
                        coffee.
 
              Jerry looks more nervous, as Ray has now taken his mother's
              hand. He is now swinging on both of them.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two-three... swing.


                                                                     19.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey.  To respect yourself enough
                        to say it out loud, to put
                        yourself out there, so openly...
                               (shakes her head)
                        ... I don't know, it got me.
 
              Now Jerry looks concerned, as Ray continues swinging happily.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two-three, swing.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks.  May I offer you both a
                        ride?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh no.  I'm sure it would just
                        make your day to drive us all the
                        way to Manhattan Beach, taking
                        that left down to little tiny
                        Waterloo street where you have to
                        play chicken with oncoming
                        traffic, and your life flashes
                        before your eyes, but -- hey, I've
                        obviously had too much coffee and
                        all -- here's my sister Laurel to
                        pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (amused)
                        Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two...
 
              Jerry lets Ray down easy.  The kid is a little disappointed.
              But Maguire bows, always courtly, and exits to get his bag.
              He then realizes something amiss and returns quickly, pulling
              Ray's hand up again and completing the swing.
 
                                  JERRY
                        ... three, swing.
 
              Ray is now happy, in love even, as Jerry exits.  Dorothy
              laughs, as her sister arrives. LAUREL BOYD is 36. No make-up,
              no bullshit. Laurel has a pin on her sweater, which catches
              on dorothy's shirt as they hug.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Come on, I'm double-parked.
 
              Dorothy returns to the world of motherhood, bending down,
              gathering Ray's toys.  She wipes at Ray's hair.


                                                                     20.
 
 
              ("Don't put food in your hair.")   She is surprised that
              she's a little jazzed from her encounter with Jerry Maguire.
              She can't help but look back at Jerry, who catches her
              looking.   He salutes her, with mock circumstance.  She
              returns it with a guilty smile.  He disappears, and she finds
              herself oddly short of breath.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (to herself)
                        Hmmph.  Whoever snagged him must
                        be some classy babe --
 
              INT. AVERY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              AVERY BISHOR, 29, makes love to Jerry Maguire at fever pitch.
              They are standing on the bed, which is in the corner.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't ever stop fucking me!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sooner... or later... I'll have to
                        stop.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been
                        better. Never BETTER!!
 
              Nearby, a large and sleepy German Shepard yawns.
 
                                  AVERY
                               (continuing)
                        Never BETTER!!
 
              The dog snaps awake, a little shook.  Avery suddenly yanks
              away. Breathing hard, she just looks at Jerry. Sex is a very
              serious business with Avery.
 
                                  AVERY
                               (continuing)
                        Open your eyes.
                               (he does)
                        If you ever want me to be with
                        another woman for you, I would do
                        it.  I'm not interested in it.
                        There was a time, yes, it felt
                        normal for me, but it was a phase,
                        a college thing, like torn Levi's
                        or law school for you... people
                        change, but if you ever feel like
                        being adventurous in that way, I
                        would do it for you.  You want
                        anything from the kitchen I'm
                        going to get some fruit --


                                                                     21.
 
 
              She skips off like a colt.  Jerry digests what he's just been
              told.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (to the next room)
                        You know.  I don't think we need
                        to do the thing where we tell each
                        other everything!
 
                                  AVERY (O.S.)
                               (laughing)
                        Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
 
              Jerry rubs his face, as he does often when processing complex
              information.
 
                                  AVERY (0.5.)
                        Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we
                        have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
 
                                  JERRY (0.5.)
                        I know about the bachelor party.
 
              Avery returns.  Her robo body, half-lit now in the hallway,
              is a glorious life-long project.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Who told you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        One of the accountants.
 
              She makes a pissed-off sound.  She then walks over, taking
              his shoulders and bending them forward.  She is an expert at
              body manipulation, loosening him as she talks.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry.  Your buddy Dooler worked
                        his ass off to make you a tribute
                        film. All those guys from the
                        office are coming.  Everybody
                        loves you.  Just calm down, relax,
                        act surprised, and have an amazing
                        time.  And you'll never guess who
                        narrates your bachelor movie.
 
              INT. FANCY HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters the hotel suite and over-acts surprise.  He
              falls down, clutching his heart, feigning an attack. He looks
              around for a bigger reaction than he actually gets.
 
              THE FILM -- SHOWN ON BIG-SCREEN T.V.
 
              It is hosted by MICHAEL JORDAN.


                                                                     22.
 
 
                                  MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I have often wondered where my
                        career would have been had Jerry
                        Maguire been my agent.  The
                        answer -- Yugoslavia.
 
              Tepid laughs, as many of the agents turn and grab furtive
              looks at Maguire, who stands at the back of the room with his
              friend BILL DOOLER.  Dooler, husky, 30, looks like a beatnik
              on steroids.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        You hear those courtesy laughs,
                        Jerry? There is a seething
                        wrongness at the edges of this
                        party.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh come on --
 
                                  DOOLER
                        This is fuckin Michael Jordan,
                        man! They should be screaming.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (eying crowd)
                        You're imagining it.
 
              They are joined by unctuous agent Bob Sugar.  Sugar is a
              Maguire wannabee.  Puts an arm on Jerry's shoulder.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        We still having lunch tomorrow,
                        Jerry?  Looks like Carl Denton
                        tested positive for marijuana.
                        That moves Cush solidly up to
                        numero uno in the draft.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Oh, that'll really help this
                        party! Let's all talk business!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (smoothly)
                        The best commercial director in
                        the business.  I hail you.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Sorry I yelled.  You have
                        exquisite taste.


                                                                     23.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Everybody's having a great time.
                        You're both nuts -- the movie's
                        great.
 
              Sugar moves on, cheerfully.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        I like that guy.
 
              (The movie, which plays simultaneously with the conversation,
              is a Hi-8 confessional of Jerry's former girlfriends.
              MICHAEL JORDAN is cut into this, nodding, as if he were
              actually interviewing.  The effect is funny, but the
              confessions are brutally honest.  There is The One He Was Too
              Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For ("He hated being
              alone.") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock
              girlfriend ("Sports makes me ill"), The Now Married With Kids
              Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend ("Beneath the cute
              exterior, more cute exterior.") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend,
              The Brainy Girlfriend, ("Great at friendship, bad at
              intimacy") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry
              Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his-
              way-to-the-airport).  All seem to agree on some basic points
              (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following
              information to underscore it.)  Jerry always has a
              girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up
              with the last one.  The relationship always competes with his
              job, and the job always wins.  The final confrontation
              happens somewhere around the 18-month mark. Sequence ends
              with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to
              burn all these old phone numbers.)
 
                                  JERRY
                               (wounded good sport)
                        ... this is... uh... too funny...
 
                                  DOOLER
                        They ain't laughing, man.
                        Something's wrong.
 
              Jerry nods, takes a swig of beer.  He knows the response is
              little more than polite.  None of the other agents can keep
              eye contact with him.  Dooler is right.  On the screen, the
              finale features a good-humored collage of Jerry photos, cut
              to music.
 
              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Elevator doors open.  Maguire is now paranoid.  He walks
              through the buzzing SMI headquarters, heading for his corner
              office.  He is like an FBI man searching treetops and corners
              for the Gunman. Everywhere he looks is a potential Grassy
              Knoll.


                                                                     24.
 
 
              He passes Fellow Agents, always smiling, giving a word of
              encouragement to an Agent having an emotional hallway
              conversation with an Athlete, even bends down to check the
              sheet of slides being approved by a very large but seated
              Basketball Player. Moving forward. There is trouble in the
              air, but only he seems to sense it.  He turns corner and is
              met by assistant WENDY, who hands him a long list of calls.
              The sheet flaps against his leg as she moves with him toward
              his back office.
 
                                  WENDY
                               (as in 'get ready')
                        Marcee's here.  She's already in
                        your office.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks, Wendy.
 
              INT. JERRY MAGUIRE'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Jerry enters his corner office overlooking both the shiny
              waters of Newport Beach and a large mall parking lot. Already
              standing, reading the mail on his desk is lively MARCEE
              TIDWELL, 25. African-American, gorgeous, a heat-seeking
              smartbomb.  She is also five months pregnant.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee.  How's my favorite
                        player's wife?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Jerry, Rod is very very upset.
                        Tyson, no!
 
              Across the room, 4 year-old menace TYSON ceases trying to pry
              a plexiglass case off the wall.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tyson, hello.
 
              Tyson just stares at Jerry.  Jerry has little luck with kids.
              He gives Marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge.  He
              grabs a two-pint bottle of orange Gatorade -- another
              habit -- and sits down at his desk.  He slips into crisis
              mode like an old shirt.

                        How can I make your life better?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I know you say to take the Arizona
                        offer, but my husband needs more
                        recognition.

                                  MARCEE (cont'd)
                        He is the biggest, fastest,
                        raddest wide-receiver in the
                        league.  Now I don't know what you
                        do for your four-percent
 
              --The door opens, Bob Sugar pokes his head in.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Cronin's okay for lunch?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee -- this is one of our
                        agents. This is Bob Sugar, who
                        needs to learn to knock.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Pleasure.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        You've called our house, right?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Sorry to interrupt you guys.
 
              Sugar exits.  Marcee resumes at the exact point, at the exact
              level of intensity.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Now I don't know what you do for
                        your five-percent, but this man,
                        my husband has a whole plan, an
                        image... we majored in marketing,
                        Jerry, and when you put him in a
                        Waterbed Warehouse commercial,
                        excuse me, you are making him
                        common.  He is pure gold and
                        you're giving him "Waterbed
                        Warehouse" when he deserves the
                        big four -- shoe, car, clothing-
                        line, soft-drink.  The four jewels
                        of the celebrity endorsement
                        dollar.
 
              Jerry finds himself admiring her drive, and she commands the
              best in him.  The desk buzzes, and Jerry ignores it.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        You gonna get that --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Not a chance.
 
              She smiles.

                                                                     26.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Marcee, things are changing around
                        here.  You and Rod will have my
                        total personal attention.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (upping the ante)
                        Damn right, and you can start by
                        taking Rod's poster and putting it
                        where people can see it!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it's infectious)
                        Damn right.
 
              He climbs up on the edge of his sofa, and reaches for the
              poster with his hanging device. True to Marcee's complaint,
              the poster hangs in the upper Siberian region of his wall.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Look at that handsome man, trying
                        to build a life up there by the
                        air-conditioner. We're coming to
                        get ya, darlin!  We are so close
                        to having it all!
 
              ON THE POSTER -- CLOSE
 
              It is the kind of poster that is strictly the domain of
              second-tier players. Commanding wide-receiver ROD TIDWELL,
              27, stands shirtless, hands on hips, looking vaguelyl
              uncomfortable. Emplazoned above his head: IN ROD WE TRUST.
              Elsewhere in the room, we hear the inevitable crash
              ("Tyson!").
 
              EXT. CRONIN'S GRILL -- AFTERNOON
 
              Crowded outdoor restaurant in the business district. Jerry
              sits down opposite Bob Sugar, still making a few notes.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Gimme a second here... Tidwell...
                        Arizona contract... new glass
                        cabinet...
 
                                  SUGAR
                        You okay?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (looking up)
                        I'm fine.  What's up?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I came here to let you go.


                                                                     27.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Pardon me?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Came here to fire you, Jerry.
 
              For a long moment there is only silence.  They study each
              other. These are two smart boys, each one anticipating the
              other's next three or four moves.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        It's real, Jerry.  You... you
                        should say something.
 
              Suddenly he's flushed, a little embarrassed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw shit...the crowded
                        restaurant... so there's no
                        scene...
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
 
              In a back room, the waiters are singing the restaurant's
              "Birthday Song" to someone else. Jerry is dying.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You...
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (razor sharp)
                        You did this to yourself.  You
                        said "fewer clients."  You put it
                        all on paper.  Scully was very
                        upset.  Heart attacks make some
                        people sweeter, but not him.  You
                        did this to yourself --
 
              Jerry's mouth opens to finish his sentence, but before he can
              speak, Sugar continues.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        -- although I do gotta hand it to
                        you.  For about five minutes you
                        had everyone applauding smaller
                        revenues.
 
              Quietly, Maguire finishes the sentence he started earlier.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You... ungrateful... unctuous...


                                                                     28.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (unctuous)
                        ... dick?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dick.
 
              Maguire reaches for water.  The sound of the ice cubes
              jangling is suddenly very loud to him. He is drowning.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Give me a little credit for doing
                        this face-to-face!  What I went
                        through knowing I was going to do
                        this to my mentor!  Can you get
                        past yourself for a second?
 
                                  JERRY
                        You'll lose.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (musically)
                        You wanted smaller.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm over it.  Now I want all my
                        clients and yours too.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Jerry --
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- and I'll get 'em.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (patronizing)
                        You'll always be my hero, Jerry.
                        Always always always.  We're
                        bringing other elements in, we're
                        focusing on endorsements -- it's
                        not about handholding anymore.
                        We're no longer babysitters --
 
              Jerry fights the desire to use his fists.  Hangs onto the
              table. He's starting to freak out now. Trying to calm down.
              Sugar's mouth keeps moving, but we hear the music in Jerry's
              mind.  Rising percussive music.
 
              EXT. STREET -- DAY
 
              Jerry tries to move briskly down the street, through the
              lunchtime businessmen traffic. Back to the office.


                                                                     29.
 
 
              INT. CRONIN'S -- DAY
 
              Sugar dines alone now.  Casually whips out a portable phone.
 
              INT. SMI ELEVATOR -- DAY
 
              Jerry in the elevator, eyes wide, mind racing.  Dorothy Boyd
              sees him, raises a hand to say hello.  Decides this is not a
              good time.
 
              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Close on Maguire as he moves through the office, heading to
              the back office.  Music
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire rolls the fax machine over to his desk.  He takes a
              breath, and begins to go to work. From within his bottom
              drawer, he withdraws a Powerbook.  Then from another drawer,
              a phone book. And then from his inner jacket pocket, a third
              smaller phone book. They are lined in front of him now, as he
              dials.
 
              INT. CUSHMAN HOME/ODESSA -- DAY
 
              Frank "Cush" Cushman picks up the phone.  Today, the young
              football God wears a yellow scarf on his head. He's still
              playing NBA Jam on his Gameboy' as he talks.
 
              EXT. CRONIN'S -- DAY
 
              Sugar at the table.  Chameleon-like, he adopts the
              personality of whomever he talks to.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Cush.  Hey Dudeboy!  It's Bob
                        Sugar. Listen, I'm callin' ya
                        first 'cause you're the most
                        important guy in sports...
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire on the telephone, fighting hard, as he feeds a fax
              into the machine at the same time.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Carla, right now you're paying 25%
                        of your endorsments to SMI, I
                        would cut my commission by 7%...
 
              As he talks, he takes a stack of his Mission Statements, once
              proudly set on his desk, and sentences them to the bottom
              drawer.


                                                                     30.
 
 
              EXT. STREET -- DAY
 
              Sugar strolls back to the office, talking on the portable.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        You read that memo I snuck to you,
                        the guy's tired of the job.  Tired
                        of making you money.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire feeds a fax, types another fax on his Powerbook, all
              while he talks quickly on the phone.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And when I got you that big
                        contract in Chicago, and the fan
                        poll in the Sun-Times was 93%
                        against you, who went and found
                        you that sympathetic journalist
                        who turned it all around, it was

              Several other agents working the cause behind Sugar, who
              breezes through the calls.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        He's costing you money, Debra...
                        he's oldschool.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Jerry on the toilet.  Not a minute to spare.

                        SMI represents all three

              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Dorothy walks the center hallway with some contracts.  To the
              right and left of her are the phones are ringing.


                                                                     31.
 
 
              Something is amiss. She stops at the desk of fellow Accounts
              Exec CLEO, 32.
 
                                  DOROTHY

                               (no big deal)
                        They fired Jerry Maguire.  Did it
                        at Cronin's.
 
              Dorothy groans softly, as she lowers herself into her seat.
              She is strangely affected by the news. She scoots back on her
              roller chair, and looks down the hallway to Maguire's office
              door.

              KATHY SANDERS, 22 year-old figure skater, sits on a couch.
              Nearby are cardboard stand-ups, souvenirs of past
              endorsements. Also, the famous gold-medal shot from the
              Olympics. Kathy's adoring Mom and Dad sit next to her,
              listening in on the extension.  The Mission Statement is
              folded open on Dad's lap.  Kathy chokes on every other word,
              such is her anguish.
 
                                  KATHY
                        I already heard from Bob Sugar.
                        Jerry I want to cry for what they
                        did to you at SMI.  You helped me
                        win that gold at the Olympics, we
                        have history, and... oh Jerry...

                        Oh Jerry, oh God...
 
              There is a click on the line.  She is pained and outraged.
 
                                  KATHY

              ROD TIDWELL, 27, begins this conversation in the kitchen.  He
              is a powerful physical presence, and he holds a hot new
              cellular phone. He fixes young son Tyson a bowl of cereal as
              he talks.  In the background, monitoring the crisis is Marcee
              Tidwell.
 
                                  ROD TIDWELL
                        "How am I doing?"  I'll tell you.
                        I'm sweatin, dude!  That's how I'm
                        "doin." I'm sweatin my contract.

                        saying.  But do you hear what I'm

              Sugar works off a wristwatch.  He spends no longer than three
              minutes on each call.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I'll bet he hasn't even called you

                        to cough...
 
              He covers the phone, as another agent hands him a cellular
              with another call on it.

                        that tells you a lot.  Hold on,
                        gotta cough...
 
              Back to the other call.

              Tidwell walks down the hallway, past clippings and citations
              from his career. Marcee follows, always listening.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable
                        commodity.  I go across the
                        middle. I see the ball and a dude
                        coming right at me, wanting to
                        kill me, I tell my brain "get
                        killed, catch the ball." That's

                        with water.  Say hello to Jerry
                        Maguire --
 
              We meet the messy-haired and slightly overweight brother of
              Tidwell, TEE PEE, 24.  Tee Pee, who lives free of charge in
              Rod's house, is a nakedly jealous and more political version
              of his brother.  He says into the phone:
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        Hello Jerry Maguire.

              Tidwell takes the phone back, and continues through the
              house, with Tee Pee now following the procession of family
              monitoring the important call.
 
                                  TIDWELL

                        don't even know where we're gonna

                        to be a "superstar," man!  Are you
                        catching my flow, here?
 
              Jerry looks at his watch.  Doomed.

              Tidwell enters bedroom.  Marcee, Tyson and Tee Pee in tow.

                        It's a very personal, very
                        important thing.  It's a family

                        Now doesn't that just make you
                        feel good to say it?  Say it with

              The lights have gone down in the city, and he hasn't had a
              chance to turn his own light on.  He sits in the oncoming
              darkness, watching the blinking white lights on the phone
              bank on the desk.

              Tidwell hangs up.  Feeling good about the decision, he enters
              his closet and adds today's shoes to an enormous shoe
              collection. Nearby, Tee Pee shakes his head.

                        bigger company.
 
              INT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Sugar crosses the last call off his sheet, and throws himself
              on the sofa.  He lands in reclining mode with a soft pooof.
              The younger turks watch their new leader.  Victory is his.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry stands at the door, holding some belongings.  He looks
              back and symbolically flips the light switch off.
              Unfortunately he hasn't realized the lights are already off.
              So, in his final gesture, surprising himself, he has weirdly
              turned the lights on.
 
              EXT. CORNER OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Bam.  Jerry's door opens.  He exits his office with box.  He
              is now in a state of advancing melancholy, slightly unhinged.
              Many of the other agents now try not to watch him leaving.


                                                                     37.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, don't worry!  I'm not going
                        to do what you think I'm going to
                        do, which is FLIP OUT!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
 
              Jerry goes to a water dispenser, calming himself, and fills
              a small Dixie cup.  Downs it and fills it again, rubbing his
              face..
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        But let me just say, as I ease out
                        of the office I helped build --
                        sorry, but it's a fact --
 
              ON DOROTHY -- WATCHING
 
              from her cubicle.
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- that there is such a thing as
                        manners.  A way of treating
                        people...
 
              He notices the fish tank nearby. He attemps to be profound.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        These fish have manners!  They
                        have manners.
 
              And now Jerry feels bravado, mixed with a wave of anger.
              Another cup of water as he finds power.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        In fact.  They're coming with me!
                        I'm starting a new company, and
                        the fish will come with me and...
                        you can call me sentimental.
 
              He begins dipping into the tank, grabbing the one exotic fish
              that failed to escape his cup. It's a fire-tailed Peruvian
              beauty.  He grabs a baggie from an assistant's desk, shakes
              out some crumbs, and dumps the fish inside.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing; to fish)
                        it's okay... it's okay...
 
              Nearby, a Xerox Repair Guy watches the human train wreck.


                                                                     38.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        But if anybody else wants to come
                        with me, this moment will be the
                        ground floor of something real and
                        fun and inspiring and true in this
                        godforsaken business and we will
                        do it together!  Who's coming with
                        me besides... "Flipper" here?
 
              But clearly even Flipper is not happy with the new
              arrangement. Panicked, he whips around the small baggie.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Anybody going with me?
 
              Silence, someone coughs, as agents and office personnel look
              on with equal parts pity and embarrassment. Jerry downs
              another small cup of water. His lid is blowing off with each
              second.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Wendy?  Shall we?
 
              Assistant Wendy looks at Maguire.  Painfully polite:
 
                                  WENDY
                        I'm three months away from the pay
                        increase, Jerry.  I have to, uh...
                        you know, stay.
 
              Jerry absorbs the blow, and takes the keys from the top of
              her desk.  She can't look at him.  Jerry stands alone, the
              blue Mission Statement on Wendy's desk sits accusingly in
              frame.  There is only silence now, the loudest kind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, anybody else?
 
              ON DOROTHY
 
              She looks around.  Doesn't anybody believe in the very thing
              they were applauding three days ago?  She has an odd
              reaction, a muscle twitch of the soul.   Before she knows it,
              she stands boldly, unfortunately knocking a cup of coffee
              onto herself in the process.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'll go with you.
                               (quietly, on her
                                coffee mess)
                        Wonderful...


                                                                     39.
 
 
              She dabs at her pants.  Next to her, Cleo looks on sadly.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              halfway across the office.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dorothy Boyd!  Thank you!
 
              She gathers her things, increasingly aware of what she's done.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        We will see you all again.  Sleep
                        tight!
 
              He walks to Dorothy, and together they exit down the hallway
              corridor, past the framed posters and awards.
 
              WIDE-SHOT
 
              rising over the huge office.  For the first time, we see the
              full expanse of the huge SMI headquarters.  And down in the
              corner of the frame, two small figures leave carrying boxes.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (to Dorothy)
                        Let's see how they do without us.
 
              A beat of silence, then noise returns to its normal
              commercial roar.  A couple of fleas have been swatted off the
              carcass of an immense beast.
 
              INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT
 
              The tragic-sounding beep of the elevator passing floors.
              Jerry Maguire stands with Dorothy, both still charged with
              adrenalin. And then the first pangs of dread. There is
              silence.  The elevator stops.  A young, amorous Couple
              enters.  Both are about 24, and the Guy presses a number five
              flights down.  In a moment, we realize they are deaf.  They
              sign to each other, murmuring noises of love. And then the
              Guy signs something, obviously powerful, because the Girl
              emits a delighted gasp, as does Dorothy.  The Couple are
              truly in their own world.  They kiss before exiting on their
              floor.  And suddenly the elevator seems empty without them.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wonder what he said.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        My favorite aunt is hearing
                        impaired. He said "you complete
                        me."


                                                                     40.
 
 
              They continue on in silence.
 
              INT. BUILDING LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy pass through another office's party.  Loud
              music. It's a pre-Easter party thrown for the building
              employees and their children.  Jerry and Dorothy squeeze
              through with boxes and fish.
 
              EXT. SMI PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy walk to their cars.  Music in distance.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        So I know this is a bad time,
                        but -- you will have a medical
                        program, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
 
              He spaces out for a moment.  Awkwardly, she touches him
              briefly.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        And I guess we didn't talk about
                        money.  So, I'll just dive in --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Give me your number.  I'll call
                        tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm
                        a little insane right now.
                               (off her look)
                        But it's going to be great.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No no, I know --
 
              They arrive at her red Camry.  She writes her number on the
              back of a business card.
 
                                  JERRY
                        But I mean really... wonderfully...
                               (out of steam)
                        great.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (unsure)
                        Absolutely.
 
              She climbs into her car, rolls down the window.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And when you think about what
                        you've done later, don't panic.


                                                                     41.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Me?  No.  My sister -- it's a good
                        bet.
 
              She starts the engine.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        That took guts.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Same to you.
 
              She salutes him as she drives off.  His own move, played back
              to him.  Camera moves away from Jerry, as he stands alone in
              the parking lot.  Salutes her in return.  Herb Alpert.  "The
              Lonely Bull." Stripped of power, his once mighty theme now
              seems puny.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOME -- NIGHT
 
              Lights glow inside this small-but-cozy home on a side street
              in Manhattan Beach. Windows open.  The sound of women's
              voices.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              A living room filled with ten earnest, talkative Divorced
              Women. This is their talk group.  We meet JAN, 30, who speaks
              shyly, thoughtfully, covering her braces often as she speaks.
              She holds a too-full glass of red wine.  (Much of the talk in
              this Women's Group will be improved by our cast of actresses)
 
                                  JAN
                        I love men.  I respect men.  But
                        that doesn't change the fact that
                        most of them belong in cages...
 
              The other nine women nod with deep understanding.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy does the dishes.  Across the room, Laurel has her
              nightly cigarette, blowing smoke out the window.  She is a no-
              frills woman. She has some time ago shut off those aspects of
              her life spent pursuing the opposite sex.  They are in mid-
              argument.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        What about medical?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Of course, medical!


                                                                     42.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (unconvinced)
                        You are a single mother.  You have
                        given up the right to be frivolous.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (irritated)
                        If you'd read what he wrote, you
                        would have left with him too.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (more irritated)
                        You know how much those Well Child
                        exams cost --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (overlapping)
                        Of course I know --
 
                                  LAUREL/DOROTHY
                        A hundred and fifty dollars.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        And that's just when he's well --
 
              They talk over each other arguing for a moment and then:
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wait. Where is he?
 
                                  LAUREL
                        He's in the living room asleep.
 
              Dorothy dries her hands, flicking in a hurry.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wonderful.  Next time you lecture
                        me, don't leave my little boy in
                        a room with your Divorced Women's
                        Group...
 
              She exits in a hurry, as Laurel throws her cigarette into the
              garbage disposal.  She has a hard time saying this, so she
              says it so nobody can hear:
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Sorry.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Ray dreams sweetly in the middle of this rockbed of Women's
              Woes. Dorothy strokes his head, as she plucks him up.  In
              frame another woman, ALICE, 50, speaks passionately to the
              group.


                                                                     43.
 
 
                                  ALICE
                        Okay I've finally, finally, gotten
                        my anger straight here.  I'm going
                        to visualize Carl being here and
                        finally tell him --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Shhhh!
 
              Dorothy exits, protectively stroking her son's head.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Come on, buddy, we're going to bed.
 
              INT. HALLWAY-- NIGHT
 
              She stops for a moment, little boy in her hands.  The
              enormity of the day arrives with a thud.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (to herself)
                        What did I do?
 
              INT. JERRY'S CONDO -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry is quickly packing for a road trip.  Avery looks on.
              They are both in a manic state.
 
                                  JERRY
                        The power move is to go
                        unannounced.
                               (sotto)
                        Black suit, right?
 
                                  AVERY
                               (sotto)
                        And the egyptian cotton shirt that
                        works with or without the jacket.
                               (full volume)
                        Tell me again, how was it left
                        with Cush?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (perfect imitation)
                        "Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Ugh!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (turns, with clothes)
                        Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.
                               (sotto)
                        Jacket on, tie in pocket.


                                                                     44.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                               (sotta)
                        Good.
                               (full volume)
                        They're all heatseekers!  All of
                        them, everybody. You keep one
                        superstar and they'll all follow.
                        There's no real loyalty, and the
                        first person who told me that,
                        Jerry Maguire, was you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think I was trying to sleep with
                        you at the time.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Well, it worked, and I will not
                        let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma-
                        fuckin-guire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        That's right.
 
                                  AVERY
                        King of the Housecalls! Master of
                        the Living Room!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, this is working.
 
                                  AVERY
                        You are not a loser.
 
              Jerry stops, turns.  The way she says "loser" is the most
              elegant of disses. She wraps her lips around it like a cheap
              hot dog.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Who said anything about "loser?"
                        Where do you get this word "loser?"
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I
                        meant something else.  When do you
                        want to leave?
 
              Jerry zips his brown travel bag shut.  He is packed and ready.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Let's go.  I'll drive you.


                                                                     45.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (stops, an odd
                                thought)
                        What if I don't get him?
 
              Avery takes his bag, heads for the door.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Function function function.
                        Forward motion is everything.
                        Cush saves all.
 
              Jerry takes a breath, exits.  Music.
 
              AIRPLANE WHEELS
 
              folding up.  Music continues.
 
              INT. RENT-A-CAR -- MORNING
 
              Jerry drives the bumpiest Texas backroad ever.
 
              Music continues.
 
              EXT. CUSHMAN DOOR -- DAY
 
              Jerry exits car.  Adjusts the jacket.  Takes the tie off too,
              returns to the car and tosses it inside.  He walks to the
              front door with purpose.  Suddenly an intercom crackles,
              jolting him with a booming and cheerful voice:
 
                                  MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
                        No sports agents allowed!  Ha ha.
 
              Jerry spots the small electronic camera pointed at him from
              the upper-corner of this rustic home.  The door buzzes.
 
              INT. CUSHMAN HALLWAY/DEN -- DAY
 
              Jerry  follows the voice down a hallway  loaded with Cush
              memorabilia.  Righteous indignation building.
 
                                  MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
                        I'm in the back den, Jerry.
 
              He moves into the den, finding MATT CUSHMAN, 40, who stands
              at the living room bar. Two framed game jerseys on the wall.
              A large draped American flag above the bar.  He is a J. Crew
              cowboy.
 
                                  MATT
                        You like a Bloody Beer, Jerry?
                        Beer and tomato juice --


                                                                     46.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        No thanks.
 
              Maguire takes a breath, and sharply begins his pitch.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Matt, I came here because in all
                        honesty your son is just another
                        piece of cattle to SMI.  But to
                        me --
 
                                  MATT
                               (overlapping)
                        We decided to stay with you.
 
              On pure instinct, he hugs Matt Cushman.  The move surprises
              them both.  And somewhere out of nowhere, come a few
              surprising tears of relief.  He has been spared.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh, thank you.
 
                                  MATT
                        Told myself -- if he shows up,
                        we'll stick with him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You know, I'm not a hugger and
                        yet... I can't let go.
 
              Matt laughs, as Cush lopes in from the kitchen.  Little
              brother KEITH, 14, enters with him.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Hey, Jerry, what's been going on?
 
              INT. DEN -- LATER DAY -- HANDHELD
 
              Cush, Matt and Jerry brainstorm around the ceremonial "wagon-
              wheel table" where decisions are made in this house.  Jerry
              is giddy, charged up, a part of the human race again.
 
                                  MATT
                        I want him to go number one in the
                        draft, and I want him to play.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's either going to be Denver or
                        San Diego trading up to take him.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (big grin)
                        Hell, I'll either surf or ski. I
                        don't care.


                                                                     47.
 
 
                                  MATT
                        Denver is where he should be.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll give it everything.
 
                                  MATT
                        You know I don't do "contracts."
                        But'cha do have my word, and it's
                        stronger than oak.
 
              Jerry toasts Matt with a bloody beer.  A good day.
 
              INT. RENT-A-CAR/TEXAS -- DAY
 
              Jerry drives back on the same bumpy road.  On the radio, it's
              the Rolling Stones.  He wants to sing along.  He thinks he
              knows the words, but...
 
                                  JERRY
                               (sings)
                        Feelin...
 
              He realizes he doesn't know the words at all. He switches
              channels. Finds a Rush song, with ornate lyrics.  No one will
              ever know what the words are.  He switches again and finds
              "Let's Groove Tonight" by Earth, Wind and Fire. Excellent.
              He begins singing nonsense noises, passionately.  Switches
              again.  All he wants is to sing along with a song he knows.
              Finally he finds Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' "Refugee."
              He drives through the countryside, singing the call and
              response of the song, like a happy idiot.
 
              INT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry turns into shot.  He's on the pay-phone.  He's jacked.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dorothy? Jerry Maguire!  Is Avery
                        there? Where can I reach her?
 
                                                       INTERCUT
 
 
 
              INT. DOROTHY/LAUREL'S HOUSE -- DAY
 
              Dorothy is at her home work desk.  Curious and nervous about
              the new arrangement.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Uh, she had to fly to Atlanta,
                        didn't leave me her hotel number.


                                                                     48.
 
 
              Through the back kitchen door comes CHAD THE NANNY, 29, red
              hair cropped above the ear. Baggy overalls.  Slipping through
              life with little turbulence.  He's with Ray, who holds pieces
              of wood and a hammer.
 
                                  CHAD
                        The new playhouse rocks, Dotty.
 
                                  RAY
                               (jumping)
                        Yeah!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Honey -- later, okay?
                               (Ray jumps on her)
                        Whoop.  Wait.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (back to phone)
                        Sorry, that's my son and the
                        nanny. I had the calls transferred
                        to my home so I could go over your
                        stuff.
 
              Chad now notices the slight excited tone in her demeanor.  He
              sits down nearby and listens to her talk to Maguire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, that's fine.  What calls came
                        in today?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wait.  That's yesterday, from the
                        other office. Today is...
 
              She flips the call record from yesterday --150 calls -- to
              today, which is blank.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        ... light.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Shit, it's just so frustrating to
                        not be able to talk to Avery --
 
                                  AVERY
                        Wait a minute, it has to be one of
                        the NFL hotels we do business
                        with -- let me look -- but in the
                        meantime, about this job --


                                                                     49.
 
 
              She reaches over Ray to get to her laptop and buzzes through
              a list of phone numbers.  Jerry can't help but share the qood
              news:
 
                                  JERRY
                               (importantly)
                        Dorothy, let me tell you
                        something, we are back. We are so
                        very very back.  I re-signed Cush.
                        We're set.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We are?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's all going to work.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I just got goosebumps.
 
              She examines her own skin with surprise.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (manic, quiet)
                        It's all going to work.  We're
                        going to save the world.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Well, I'm happy for you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Happy for us.
 
              Oddly, the phrase affects her physically.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Happy for us... okay.  Here's the
                        number. 404-453-2222.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Call me later, hon.
 
              She hangs up, and looks over to Laurel and Chad. Both of them
              stare at her.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
 
                                  CHAD
                               (laughing)
                        Yeah, Dotty. You did.


                                                                     50.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Twenty six years old.  I'm already
                        saying "hon". Hug your mother
                        quickly --
 
              Chad looks at her, something is different about Dorothy.
              Laurel walks away, sharing a look with Chad.
 
              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry is now teeming with energy, professional and sexual.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Avery, I signed Cush.  Again.
 
                                                       INTERCUT
 
              INT. ATLANTA HOTEL SUITE -- DAY
 
              Avery in mid-conference with four other NFL men in background.
 
                                  AVERY
                        YA-HOOOO-SIE!
 
              It is the victory call of the competitive girl, and she falls
              back into a chair, kicking her expensive shoes onto the bed.
              In the b.g. we see the hungry look of her male co-workers.
              Part of them lusts after her.  The larger part knows she
              would demolish them, and pick her teeth with their bones.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I know.  Sorry I threw a scare
                        into our lives there --
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't worry about it -- I never
                        told you what I thought of that
                        memo either --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, no you didn't --
 
                                  AVERY
                        You lost your head, it happens.
                               (quickly)
                        I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen.
                        I'm going to have to fly to
                        Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we
                        meet in the Dallas airport and we
                        all fly into New York together for
                        the draft?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a plan --  --


                                                                     51.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'll set it up with your girl.
                        Woo!  This is when it's good,
                        Jerry. Enjoy it. Live it.  Love
                        it.  And when I see you, I'm going
                        to give you the best blow job of
                        your life.
 
              He hangs up, staring at the phone. In the room with Avery,
              the co-workers look at each other. She is far, far out of
              their league.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S CAR -- LATER MORNING -- DRIVING
 
              Dorothy Boyd speeds Jerry to the airport, the electricity
              fills the car. On the radio, a sports station debates the
              future of Cushman. as Jerry whips through a stack of sports
              pages.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Avery'll meet you at the B gate at
                        4:15.  Don't be late. Tidwell will
                        already be there.
 
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (nods to Ray)
                        Hey, man, you know they have big
                        balloons built into cars?
 
                                  RAY
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        They do, my brother.
 
                                  RAY
                               (giggling)
                        I'm not your brother!
 
              Dorothy continues, business on her mind.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        ... I put Tidwell on the same
                        floor at the Marriott Marquis.  I
                        think it's great you're taking him
                        to the draft. He doesn't smoke,
                        right? I have no idea.


                                                                     52.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I have no idea.
                               (continuing to Ray)
                        So Ray, if there's an accident or
                        something, it goes pwoooooooof --
                               (simulates air-bag)
                        -- and you go booooong.  And
                        you're safe.
 
              Jerry bounces against the imaginary balloon.  Ray is
              delighted by Jerry.   Dorothy notes that he's great with her
              son.  She pats Jerry on the shoulder.  Her hand lingers
              perhaps a millisecond too long.  She pulls away quickly,
              always feeling on the edge or embarrassing herself around
              this guy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay, have we gone over
                        everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yep.  Have a good time at school,
                        Ray.  Wish me luck.
 
                           DOROTHY                       RAY
                   Luck.                         LUCK!
 
              Jerry nods and exits.  They watch as Jerry inches into the
              crowded airport.  Into frame, obscuring their view of Jerry,
              enters another Couple, who embrace each other and their small
              girl.   It's a genuinely sweet goodbye, and we linger on
              Dorothy and Ray who both watch with private fantasies of the
              goodbye they didn't get. Mother and son look at each other,
              communicating volumes. They pull back into traffic.
 
              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry struggles through the Dallas airport, is the last, of
              his party to arrive at the B gate in Dallas.  Avery, tall and
              cool in plaid skirt and shades, is in combat mode.   Nearby,
              Cush is surrounded by fans and fawning Airline Employees.
              ("Where do you think you're gonna end up, Cush?"  "You gonna
              be rich, dude!") Tidwell looks jealous and ingnored as he
              leans against the airline counter, unnoticed.  A lone kid
              approaches Tidwell.
 
                                  KID
                        Are you Hootie?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        No man, I'm not Hootie.
 
              Kid leaves disappointed. Tidwell sinks lower. Doesn't anyone
              know his stardom, his essence, his power?


                                                                     53.
 
 
                                  BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT
                        All those disabled, and Frank
                        Cushman can board now...
 
              INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY
 
              Jerry sits next to Cushman, who is reading Bukowski's Notes
              of a Dirty Old Man.  Across the aisle is Tidwell, who sits
              next to Avery.  They are a small family, and Jerry feels at
              home with his operation.  Cush looks up suddenly.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (a big thought)
                        Jerry.  Why does God sometimes
                        reward the evil and punish the
                        good?
 
              Jerry shares a look with Avery, who is on the other side of
              Cush. Her stockings swish as she crosses her legs.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Let me think about that.  Want
                        something to drink?
 
                                  CUSH
                               (thoughtful pause)
                        I see what you're saying.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait.  What do you mean?
 
              The two men have now totally confused each other. Tidwell
              leans across the aisle to Cush, attempting comraderie.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hey man, I wish I had a
                        quarterback like you in Arizona.
                        You're the shit.
 
              Cush looks up.  Compliments blow off him like a summer breeze.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Thank ya.
 
              Tidwell waits for a compliment of his own, but Cush doesn't
              offer one.  He returns to the book.  Tidwell feels slighted.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (loud mumble)
                        Well you ain't that mothafuckin
                        good.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Say what?


                                                                     54.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I said -- last I heard, Jesus
                        Christ was still in heaven.  And
                        you ain't even played in the NFL.
 
              Cush throws his book away, ready for anything, as Tidwell
              rises. Nearby passengers begin to panic.
 
                                  JERRY
                        This can't be happening to me.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry!  Do something --
 
              Jerry throws himself in front of Cushman.
 
                                  JERRY
                        HEY.  Knock it off.  What are you,
                        five years old?  Am I taking the
                        kids to Chuck E. Cheese here? Grow
                        up, both of you!  We are a family.
                        And we go to the draft in an
                        ORDERLY FASHION.
 
              Beat. Jerry wonders if he's pushed his mealtickets around too
              much.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hey, man, I dig Check E. Cheese.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Me too, dude.  Especially that big
                        old singin' Elvis Monkey.  That's
                        just insanity, man.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Heard that.
 
              Tidwell reaches over, he and Cush exchange a fingertips five.
              Briefly, the two clients bond. Past Tidwell, Avery smiles
              engagingly at Jerry.  He handled the situation well.  She
              crosses her legs, stockings swishing.  The workplace excites
              her.
 
              EXT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS -- NIGHT
 
              The headquarters for the NFL draft is buzzing with activity.
              Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company.  Media
              lights flick on, bathing Cush.  Reporters chatter. ("Is it
              San Diego or Denver, Cush?N  "Cush!")  Fans at the outskirts
              are calling out to the young star ("Go get the big chi-ching,
              Cush!") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position.
              Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. ("I'll either surf or
              ski.")  Jerry admires his fiancee.  There is nothing more
              attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job.


                                                                     55.
 
 
              Shot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at
              the outskirts.  He turns and exits unnoticed.
 
              INT. GIFT SHOP -- NIGHT -- LATER
 
              Tidwell hides out in the gift shop, thumbing through
              magazines. The chip on his shoulder grows by the minute.
              Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and
              emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother.  Both wear
              self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young
              athlete's face on it.  Something about them, their pure
              enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way.  He almost cries, for
              himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters.  Tidwell is
              embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state.
 
                                  JERRY
                        At last I find you.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (sharply)
                        Why the fuck am I here?  I feel
                        like I'm five years late for the
                        Prom.
 
              In a look, Jerry sizes up the situation.  With a hand on
              Tidwell's large shoulder, he smoothly pumps up the big man's
              ego.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Come on.  Come with me.  We're
                        going to take a walk through this
                        lobby. I want every media guy,
                        every player rep, everybody to see
                        you for what you are.  The best-
                        kept secret in the NFL. The
                        biggest wide-receiver in the game.
                        Let 'em see ya, Rod.  And Whatever
                        you do, don't sit down. Let 'em
                        see how big you are.  You ready?
                        Let's do it.
 
              He is privately thrilled, but offers only:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (begrudgingly)
                        A'right.  Let's walk.
 
              We hear the ripping guitar explosion of The Who's "Magic Bus"
              from Live at Leeds.


                                                                     56.
 
 
              INT. MARRIOTT LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire and Tidwell move through the brightly-lit lobby, past
              the reporters, the competing agents, the team
              representatives, the already blasted Jets fans, past even a
              Nike crew filming an NFL spot in the lobby.  Portable phones
              everywhere, in every hand.
 
              There is a heavy white media light bathing everything -- as
              if life had become a t.v. show, and everything within it
              concerned making other t.v. shows.  Jerry works hard,
              introduces Tidwell around. And Tidwell is natural, polite and
              charming, as they move through the pre-draft crowd.  He does
              not sit down.  Music continues.
 
              INT. MARRIOTT BAR -- DAY
 
              Tough red-headed beat reporter PATRICIA LOGAN watches Maguire
              and Tidwell from the opposite corner.
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Dennis, try not to laugh.  Jerry
                        Maguire brought Rod Tidwell to the
                        draft...
 
              INT. ARIZONA CARDINALS WAR ROOM PHOENIX) -- NIGHT
 
              Arizona General Manager DENNIS WILBURN, 48, is on the phone
              here in the command center for the Arizona Cardinals.  All
              around him, we see the boards and graphs for their upcoming
              draft selections.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        Good, I hope he unloads him so I
                        can buy a decent quarterback.
                        Who's he talking to?
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Right now, Dallas.  Ha ha.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        They don't look interested do they?
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Actually...
 
              Wilburn looks concerned.
 
              INT. MARRIOTT ESCALATOR -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level
              above the bright-white lobby.  Maguire looks down at the
              scene.  He breathes in the commotion.  In another twelve
              hours, he will be at the very epicenter with Cushman.


                                                                     57.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I came all the way here for that?
                        To walk the lobby?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah.  And it might have even
                        worked too.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Let's do it again.
 
              Jerry doesn't respond.  Down in the lobby, Jerry catches a
              glimpse of a familiar-looking agent.  It's Sugar. Jerry is
              consumed with a thousand other thoughts, but Tidwell
              continues talking.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        You believe they're shooting a
                        Nike ad down there?  Did I ever
                        tell you my Nike story?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I gotta get back to Cushman.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it
                        down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they
                        do is ignore me...
 
              Jerry turns to Tidwell, finally focusing totally on him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You know what was great about you
                        down there?  For about five
                        minutes, you unloaded that rather
                        expansive, let me just say "large"
                        chip that resides right there on
                        your shoulder, and you know what?
                        You were brilliant.  Take care.
 
              Jerry starts to exit.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You're loving me now, aren't ya?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (mock serious)
                        I'm not about love -- I'm about
                        "showing you the money."
 
              Tidwell nods deeply, respectfully.


                                                                     58.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good.  I was just testing ya.
                               (beat)
                        But just you saying that? Makes me
                        love ya.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Sure you don't want to go out and
                        find some karoake?  I'm a very
                        good singer, man --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Call me tomorrow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I might call you later!
 
              Tidwell moves off, still feeling good about the walk.  A
              small pack of diehard Jets fans pass, looking for autographs.
 
              INT. CUSH'S SUITE -- NIGHT
 
              We glide into Frank Cushman's suite overlooking Times Square.
              It's filled with NFL swag -- free t-shirts, athletic bags,
              sweatpants, and more.  Half-finished room service food
              abounds.  Matt, Keith and Cush's stylish college girlfriend
              ANNE-LOUISE mill about the room, basking in the glow of the
              man of the moment.  Cush, who holds a guitar in his lap,
              wears the odd combination of a Nirvana t-shirt and a NFL
              jacket.  He signs for more room service and continues
              strumming the only song he knows on guitar, Cobain's
              "Something In The Way."  Jerry enters on a rush of adrenalin.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (to hotel waiter)
                        Hey, what size are you?
 
                                  WAITER
                        Eleven.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (grandly)
                        Why don't you grab a couple pairs
                        of them new Nikes by the door --
 
              Waiter spots a very tall stack of new Nikes by the door.
 
                                  WAITER
                        Dude, you're like a God.


                                                                     59.
 
 
                                  CUSH
                               (immediately)
                        God, you're like a dude.
 
              It's a great line, and the room breaks up.  This is charisma,
              the future of the NFL.  Waiter exits, as Cush continues
              strumming. And now Jerry speaks, importantly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Cush, Matt -- we have a decision
                        to make.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "It's okay to eat fish, 'cause
                        they Don't have any feelings...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay. San Diego just came in with
                        a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "Something in the way.  Yeah."
 
                                  MATT
                        Well, he's gotta go number one.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "Ooooooo."
 
                                  JERRY
                        He still goes number one, but San
                        Diego wants to trade up with New
                        England -- they want him bad.
 
              Cush turns to his curiously ambivalent father, who walks to
              the window and looks out at the big Jumbotron with Keith.
 
                                  MATT
                        What happened to Denver?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Denver got very silent about a day
                        ago.  San Diego's got a fever for
                        Cush.  This stuff tends to happen
                        the night before a draft.  People
                        get crazy.  And San Diego, you
                        should know, is crazy to the tune
                        of seven years for thirty. Signing
                        bonus of eight.
                               (beat)
                        Million.
 
              Anne-Louise whistles loudly.  She is instantly embarrassed,
              and puts a hand up.  Sorry.  In the next room, the phone is
              ringing.


                                                                     60.
 
 
                                  MATT
                        I don't know, Jerry.
 
                                  KEITH
                        Should I unplug the phone?
 
                                  CUSH
                        Reporters, Jerry.  They been
                        callin' all night.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Just be friendly and say "no
                        comment."
 
                                  CUSH
                        Talking and saying nothing, man,
                        it's an art I have not mastered.
 
              Jerry holds up a finger -- watch me.  Jerry picks up the
              ringing phone. He offers a near-perfect imitation.
 
                                  JERRY
                        "This is Cush."
 
              Suddenly, everyone is, laughing.  The room lightens.
 
              INT. BOB SUGAR'S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
 
              Bob Sugar talks on his hotel phone.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        It's Sugar.  He must be there,
                        right? Just sniff or something if
                        he's there.
                               (Jerry sniffs,
                                panicked)
                        Alright, buddydude.  Just
                        remember. You're swimming with the
                        big boys now. You let your dad do
                        all the talking.  I'm the one who
                        got you the deal you needed.  This
                        is business not friendship. Be
                        strong.  You're global now.
 
              Sugar hangs up.
 
                                  JERRY
                        "No comment.
 
              Jerry hangs up.  The room is still laughing.  His head is
              spinning.
 
                                  KEITH
                        Hey, it's Cush on the big t.v.
                        again!


                                                                     61.
 
 
                                  CUSH
                        Hell, I'm already sick of me. I
                        got "Cushlash."
 
              More laughs. Jerry sits across from Matt, reeling quietly. He
              speaks casually, directly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, before I go back to Denver.
                        I think we should put something
                        down on paper.  Something that
                        says, "hey, I'm with Jerry
                        Maguire."
 
              He pulls out a yellow legal tablet.  He scribbles a few
              lines, as Matt looks increasingly nervous.
 
                                  MATT
                        Not right now, Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Do I know everything there is to
                        know here?
                               (silent beat)
                        You fellas aren't talking with Bob
                        Sugar, are you?
 
              More silence.
 
                                  MATT
                        Apparently, Denver wanted to deal
                        with him instead of you.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (quickly)
                        Said who?  Sugar?
 
                                  MATT
                        Hey, I'm learning as I go.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal
                        with Denver behind my back?
 
                                  MATT
                        I'm sorry, I --
 
                                  JERRY
                        I brought Denver to twenty
                        million. Denver deals with me all
                        the time. You listened to Sugar?
                        You let that snake in the door.
 
              Jerry touches the coffee table.  Calms himself.


                                                                     62.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        It's okay.  You want Denver. I'll
                        fix this up.  You didn't sign
                        anything with Sugar, right?
 
              Another rough silence is broken by little brother Keith.
 
                                  KEITH
                               (blurts)
                        Mr. Maguire, someday I'm gonna be
                        a famous athlete and I'm gonna
                        sign with you'.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Shut up!
                               (beat)
                        I'm sorry... sorry.
 
                                  KEITH
                               (sympathy for Jerry)
                        S' cool.
 
              Shot moves in on Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually
                        sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me
                        you didn't sign.
                               (beat)
                        Because I'm still sort of moved by
                        your "my word is stronger'n oak"
                        thing --
 
                                  MATT
                        We signed an hour ago.  You were
                        in the lobby with the black fella.
 
              Jerry moans. Silently, he rises and begins to gather his
              things. Cush hangs on to his guitar.
 
                                  CUSH
                        I'm sorry, Jerry.
 
                                  MATT
                        They say it's show "business,"
                        Jerry, not show friends.
 
              Jerry takes a breath before he exits. He surveys the room,
              settling on Cush.  Visible behind Maguire is Times Square, in
              all it's neon logo glory.


                                                                     63.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well. Okay. Of course. You're
                        twenty years old, and I'm just
                        another guy in a suit.  It's all
                        business. It didn't work out.  You
                        didn't buy my product, which is,
                        unfortunately, mm. Let me see,
                        there's a speech that I'm supposed
                        to make -- right! -- "I'll be out
                        there cheering for you." "The door
                        is always open!"  See? I'm a class
                        act.
                               (breath, directly)
                        But maybe this would have all
                        worked, us being real human
                        beings, coming through for each
                        other, really, and now I'll never
                        know. You'll never know. Weren't
                        you curious?
                               (they aren't)
                        No.  Okay, well, I'll be fine.
                        And you'll be fine.  And Keith I
                        bope you do call me.
 
              Flushed and embarrassed, he exits.  We hang a beat on the
              silent Cushman hotel livingroom, as Cush now continues on
              guitar.
 
              INT. LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry exits elevator dazed, at full trot.  The Marriott lobby
              is packed.  He is looking for Avery.  Beat reporter Patricia
              Logan reappears.  She relishes asking brutal questions,
              innocently.
 
                                  PATRICIA LOGAN
                        Jerry, is it true that Tidwell's
                        had three concussions?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm sorry... excuse me...
 
              INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters the grand ballroom, looking for Avery.
              Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere.  NFL reps and
              media workers move tables and work out camera and seating
              arrangements.  Elevated in a open ESPN booth six feet off the
              ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's
              draft.  Fans heckle him by singing the ESPN theme.  He rolls
              with it, expertly.  Jerry spots Avery across the empty
              ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty
              tables.


                                                                     64.
 
 
              INT. ADJACENT BUFFET ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry finally catches up with Avery in the empty side-room.
 
                                  AVERY
                        I just heard.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What do I do?  How do I spin this?
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh honey.  It's spun.
 
              She keeps moving, adding an extra snap to the packets.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What did I do to you?
 
              She is furious with his question.  Doesn't he know?
 
                                  AVERY
                        It's all about you, isn't it?
                        Soothe me, save me, love me --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Could you just stop moving?
 
                                  AVERY
                        I have to finish my job --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Everything's on the fucking run!
                        Everything --
 
              She stops.  Walks to him, framed by a bank of t.v. monitors.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry.  You and I are salespeople.
                        We sell --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, I don't want a --
 
                                  AVERY
                        It's not "love me."  It's not
                        "trust my handshake."  It's make
                        the sale. Get it signed.  There
                        shouldn't be "confusion" about
                        that.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Go ahead.  Jump right on into my
                        nightmare.  The water's warm.


                                                                     65.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        So honesty is outlawed here, I
                        can't be honest?
 
              She turns and exits again.  He follows.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tell you what -- I'd prefer
                        loyalty..
 
                                  AVERY
                        What was our deal when we first
                        got together?  Brutal truth,
                        remember?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think you added the "brutal."
 
              She stops, slaps down another media packet.  Blows a
              troublesome piece of hair out of her face.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry, there is a "sensitivity"
                        thing that some people have.  I
                        don't have it.  I don't cry at
                        movies.  I don't gush over babies.
                        I don't start celebrating
                        Christmas five months early, and
                        I don't tell a man who just
                        screwed up both of our lives --
                        'oh, poor baby.'  That's me.  For
                        better or worse.  But I do love
                        you.
 
              Jerry looks at his fiancee.  Standing here, watching Avery
              coldly clasping her media packs to her chest, she looks
              different to him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Avery --
 
              She knows what's coming.  She moves fast to avoid him.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't say it.  We're both ragged
                        out right now.
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- stop --
 
              She exits back into the main ballroom.  For a moment, she
              stops. They face off.  This is it.  They are quickly
              interrupted by overweight, talk-show voiced CURTIS WEINTRAUB,
              45.


                                                                     66.
 
 
                                  CURTIS WEINTRAUB
                        Hey!  Curtis Weintraub from the
                        Sports Popper!  Haven't seen you
                        two since the Cuervo Gold Rock 'n
                        Sock Charity Six Flags Budfest!
                        Hello!
 
              Neither look at him, they remain fixed on each other.  Curtis
              gets a whiff of what he walked into.
 
                                  CURTIS WEINTRAUB
                               (continuing; exiting
                                quickly)
                        Goodbye!
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'm warning you.  Don't say it.
                        You won't have another chance.
 
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen to me!
 
                                  AVERY
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's over --
 
              She continues moving into the next room.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Didn't hear it.
 
                                  JERRY
                        There is something missing here.
 
                                  AVERY
                        You've never been alone and you
                        can't be alone --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen to me, it's over.
 
              She can barely believe it.  She blinks.
 
                                  AVERY
                        No one has ever dumped me.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm not trying to make history.


                                                                     67.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        I did the 23 hour nose-route to
                        the top of El Capitan in 6 hours!
                        I can make this work.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it slips out)
                        No.
 
              She takes a breath.  It sinks in.  From somewhere, the small
              voice of her vulnerability.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (steps closer)
                        You know I didn't ever want to
                        hurt you.
 
              She gets an odd look, shaking her head.  Starts to step away,
              then thinks better of it.  She WALLOPS him in the face with
              the back of her hand.  Jerry stands like a woozy boxer. She
              hits him again with a fist, then again in the chest.  He
              sinks to the floor, sagging. backwards.  She straddles him,
              addresses him fully, right in his bruised face.
 
                                  AVERY
                        I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
                        I'm too strong for you.  Loser.
 
              INT. JFK AIRPORT -- NEXT MORNING
 
              Jerry moves through the crowded airport with Rod Tidwell.
              Both wear sunglasses.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You love me now, don't you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Very much.
 
              ON TV MONITOR -- ROY FIRESTONE
 
              is leaning forward, expressively, talking with a weepy
              athlete.
 
              INT. RED CARPET LOUNGE -- DAY
 
              Tidwell watches next to Jerry, as they wait for the flight.
              Jerry nurses a stiff drink.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Everybody on this show cries now.


                                                                     68.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (off t.v. )
                        You feel bad you tested positive?
                        Quit doing blow!  You feel bad
                        about your baby girl? Why did you
                        leave the mother?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What are you doing with me, Rod?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Huh?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't you even see -- I'm
                        finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four
                        hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm
                        a cautionary tale!
 
              Tidwell looks at Jerry, impassive.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        See this jacket I'm wearing?  You
                        like it?  I don't really need it,
                        because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE.
                        I lost the number one draft pick
                        the night before the draft. They
                        will teach my story to other
                        agents on "do not do this" day in
                        agent school. Why? Let's recap.
                        Because a hockey player's kid made
                        me feel like a superficial jerk,
                        I had two slices of bad pizza,
                        went to bed, grew a conscience and
                        wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        The least you could do is nod and
                        act sympathetic --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (shaking head)
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a quality that might come in
                        handy for a commercial sometime.


                                                                     69.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You are not allowed to act this
                        way.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why not?
 
              INT. AIRPLANE -- LATER DAY
 
              They sit together. Jerry holds another drink.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Man, I got a shelf life of ten
                        years, tops!  My next contract's
                        gotta bring me the dollars that'11
                        last me and mine a very long time.
                        I'm out of this sport in five
                        years.  What's my family gonna
                        live on? What you get me.  So I
                        don't want to hear about ya shit,
                        your "nya nya nya."
 
                                  JERRY
                               (ruefully, to
                                attendant)
                        Another drink please.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Anybody else would have left you
                        by now, but I'm sticking with you.
                        I said I would. And if I got to
                        ride your ass like Zorro, you're
                        gonna show me the money.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (the hell that never
                                ends)
                        Oh my God.
 
              He looks straight ahead, at the airphone in front of him.
 
              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy finds Laurel on their small porch.  There is only
              room for a miniature garden and one comfortable seat. Laurel
              sits in it.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's coming over.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        At eleven at night?


                                                                     70.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He just lost his best client.  He
                        called from the plane.  I invited
                        the guy over.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This
                        is a "syndrome."  It's called
                        Early Midlife, About-To-Marry,
                        Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear-
                        God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll-
                        Call-My-Newly Long-suffering-
                        Assistant-Without Medical-For-
                        Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing
                        all that, you still allow him to
                        come over, more power to you.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Honey, he's engaged.  And for the
                        first time in my professional
                        life, I'm a part of something I
                        believe in.
 
              Dorothy exits.  Laurel shakes her head, calls to next room.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Okay, but he better not be good
                        looking!
 
              INT. RAY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy puts Ray to bed.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        'Night buddy.  This is my favorite
                        part of your head.
 
              She kisses the corner of his forehead, rising up into the
              mirror.
 
              She checks her look, in spite of herself. Visible on the wall
              above Ray's bed, is her ex-husband's photo. Music.
 
              INT. CAB -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in back of a cab, wearing sunglasses, three drinks
              later, post-flight, rolling with anything.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, turn here!  Sharp right
                        turn. 8831 3/4 Waterloo.
 
              The cab turns onto a very small street.  Cars parked on both
              sides. Down the street, another pair of headlights.


                                                                     71.
 
 
              Jerry's cab refuses to give in, in fact he floors it.  Same
              with the oncoming car.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Yes, good, floor it, kill us!!
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Door opens to reveal Jerry Maguire with brown bag, shoulder
              hang-up bag, disheveled hair and sunglasses.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm Jerry Maguire.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (super pleasant)
                        You seem just the way I pictured
                        you. I'm her disapproving sister
                        Laurel.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Honesty.  Thank you.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              Jerry enters, as Dorothy rounds the corner.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi.
 
              The lights are low and his glasses are very dark.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Thanks for inviting me over.
                        Where's the little guy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's asleep.  Watch out for that
                        lamp.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm glad you're home.  That
                        "alone" thing is... not my
                        specialty...
 
              He ducks the lamp, barely. Laurel exits through his shot,
              miming "drinking" behind his back. Jerry takes off his
              glasses, revealing a welt and a cut below his eye.


                                                                     72.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh my God.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with
                        Avery.
 
              Dorothy's entire body chemistry changes in ways she doesn't
              quite understand.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Too bad.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Better now than later.  We'll
                        still be friends. I'm dying here.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
 
                                  JERRY
                        And just think if I got her the
                        ring she really wanted.
 
              Dorothy laughs.  He looks at her strangely.  Suddenly she
              feels very nervous, as he sets down his bags.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a
                        seat. I'll get you some aloe vera
                        for that cut too.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Do you have something to drink?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sure --
 
              She moves to the kitchen door.  She is about to exit, when
              Jerry begins to unburden.
 
                                  JERRY
                        My brother works for the White
                        House. He pretends he's an
                        intellectual.  He pretends he's
                        from the east coast.
 
              She turns, not quite sure what his point is.  She waits
              politely for Jerry to finish before exiting into the kitchen.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I was supposed to be the
                        successful one.
                                  (more)


                                                                     73.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        But I don't want to talk about it.
                        And yet!  My family.  I grew up
                        with repression as a... a
                        religion --you don't bitch.  No
                        moaning!  Head down.  Do it,
                        whatever "it" may be. My dad... he
                        worked for the United Way for 38
                        years!  You know what he said when
                        he retired? He said, "I wish I'd
                        had a more comfortable chair." 38
                        years he sat in it!  Do you know
                        what I'm saying, Dorothy?
                        Repression as a religion. I'm
                        almost as old as his chair.
 
              He rubs his face.  She looks at him, and the situation
              slightly overwhems her. Here he is, wide-open, ripe for the
              taking.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Beer okay?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, thanks.
 
              INT. KITCHEN
 
              Laurel smokes a cigarette and blows it out the window.
              Dorothy goes for the refrigerator, finds a couple beers.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        I heard.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No kidding.  I looked over and saw
                        the shadow of two curious shoes in
                        the doorway of the kitchen.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        This guy would go home with a
                        gardening tool right now if it
                        showed interest.
                               (off Dorothy's look)
                        Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (surprised)
                        Thank you.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Look, here's some of that chicken
                        with salsa too, I warmed it up --


                                                                     74.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        That's the girl I love.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        But you just gotta hear me out on
                        one thing.  You're very
                        responsible with Ray and you know
                        it's not right for a little boy to
                        hear some strange man's voice in
                        the house.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        As opposed to twenty angry women?
 
              Dorothy turns quickly and the beer, sisters and chicken
              collide in the small kitchen.  Dorothy deftly catches the
              food in her t-shirt, and dumps it back onto the plate.  But
              her shirt is now stained. She starts to quietly implode, and
              Laurel takes command.  They know each other well.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Come on, let's get you another
                        top --
 
              They exit to nearby laundry room.
 
              EXT. HOUSE/WINDOW OUTSIDE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Now camera starts to move around the house, from this window
              showing the two sisters in the laundry room, to the living
              room where Jerry sits alone.  We see Ray wander into the room
              and stare at Jerry.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry, who is playing with a kaleidoscope on the table, looks
              up to see Ray.
 
                                  RAY
                        Hi.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi Ray.
 
              INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- SAME TIME
 
                                  LAUREL
                        All I'm saying.  You don't have
                        the luxury of falling for some
                        drowning man.  Be practical.  Now.
                        Which top?
 
              She holds up two tops.  One is sexier with a dipped down
              front. The other is striped, cute, functional.


                                                                     75.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay, you want to talk about
                        practical? Let's talk about my
                        wonderful life. Do you know what
                        most other women my age are doing
                        right now? They are partying in
                        clubs, trying to act stupid,
                        trying to get a man, trying to
                        keep a man... not me. I'm trying
                        to RAISE a man.
 
              She grabs the sexier top, and puts it on.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I've got a 24 hour a day reminder
                        of Roger, for the rest of my life.
                        I have had three lovers in four
                        years, all boring, all achingly
                        self-sufficient all friends of
                        yours I might add, and all of them
                        running a distant second to a warm
                        bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at
                        me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in
                        the world!  How do I look?
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Good.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Thanks.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Ray have a great conversation, playing tug with a
              piece of rope.
 
                                  RAY
                        And then my dad died and my mom
                        took me to the zoo and I love the
                        zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you
                        love the zoo?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait.  I want to tell you more
                        about my dad.
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's go the zoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay.  I've been hogging it.
                        You're right.
                                  (more)


                                                                     76.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        All my life I've been trying to
                        talk, really talk, and no one
                        wants to listen.  You know that
                        feeling?
 
              Ray nods vigorously.
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's go right now.  Let's go to
                        the zoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw, the fucking thing... I mean,
                        the zoo is closed.
 
                                  RAY
                        You said "fuck".
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah I know.  I did.
 
              Ray loves this guy.  He pats Jerry's knee.
 
                                  RAY
                        I won't tell.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We'll go to the zoo sometime.
                        Okay? I think I might have some
                        time on my hands.
 
              Ray looks at Jerry's hands.
 
                                  RAY
                        I don't see any.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (points respectfully)
                        Funny.
 
                                  RAY
                        Funny...
                               (imitates him)
                               (hears mom
                                approaching)
                        I better go to bed.
 
              Ray hugs Jerry and exits.  Jerry sits contemplating the kid
              for a moment.  The door swings open and a harried Dorothy
              appears in the sexier top, but with a distinctly less sexy
              attitude, and a tray.


                                                                     77.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you
                        a cab.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (slightly confused)
                        Good idea.  Thank you.
 
              And we should keep our voices down a little.  I have a little
              boy asleep.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Right.  Of course.
 
              Jerry tries to twist open the beer, ripping at his palm. It's
              not a twist-off.  She hands him an opener.  He opens it,
              inelegantly.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        So.  Our company.
 
              She watches the drunken man, who drinks. Then coughs a
              little. Then stands.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay.  Lil' speech before I go.
 
              He gets up, woozy, but loose.  Powerfully:
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Do.  Not.  Worry.  About.  Your.
                        Job.
                               (beat)
                        Our company is in good shape. You
                        and your son... we... are just
                        fine.  You still have a job. I
                        want you to feel confident!  In.
                        Me.  And I have a problem with
                        people who talk about themselves
                        in the third person, but let me
                        tell you something about Jerry
                        Maguire.
 
              His confidence nicely fueled, Jerry reaches for a fireplace
              poker. He begins to joust with an imaginary opponent.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Come after me and you will lose I
                        am a survivor!  Do not
                        underestimate Jerry Maguire!  I've
                        got wits!
                                  (more)


                                                                     78.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        I've got the instincts of a
                        panther!
                               (joust)
                        I've got Dorothy Boyd on my side!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't worry about me.  I can get
                        jobs --
 
                                  JERRY
                        We will be fine!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        -- especially one like this.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And I am...
 
              He becomes very aware of himself. Acting out in a virtual
              stranger's small-but-comfortable living room.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I am drunk.
 
              He collapses onto the sofa, embarrassed.  Shaking his head.
              Dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair.  She breaks the
              personal barrier, carefully touching his wound with the wet
              tip of the aloe vera plant.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Truth?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sure.
 
              Dorothy turns to see that Laurel's two shoes are still very
              visible at the kitchen door.  Decides to ignore them.  She
              gets closer.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sure, I care about the job.  Of
                        course.  But mostly...
                               (very honest)
                        ...  I want to be inspired.
 
              There is something inspiring about the way she says the word
              "inspiring."
 
                                  JERRY
                        Me too.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What you wrote inspired me.


                                                                     79.
 
 
              He is catching a scent of that most ancient elixer.  A
              woman's affection.  Their heads inch closer together.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I'm working with you because of
                        that memo...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Mission... statement...
 
              They kiss.  It turns rather passionate.  She places a cool
              hand on his cheek.   He places a hand on her breast.  The
              taxi beeps outside.  She pulls away.  Both regard the hand on
              her breast.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Well.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sorry about this hand.
                               (he rises unsteadily)
                        You know that feeling -- you're
                        not completely embarrassed yet,
                        but you glimpe tomorrow's
                        embarrassment?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't worry about it, boss.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh shit.  You said "boss."
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Yeah, I did.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No.  No don't feel like Clarence
                        Thomas.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I do.  I feel like Clarence
                        Thomas.
                               (the worst day ever)
                        I'm like... harrassing you...
                        right now.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I may not sue.
 
              He laughs a little.  Music.  Unsure what more to say, Jerry
              rubs his face.  And then:


                                                                     80.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, good evening.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good evening.
 
              He stands, returns the fireplace poker to her, and exits.
              Stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the
              front porch, he recovers with style.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We'll be okay.  And I'm going to
                        take my... one client and we're
                        gonna go all the way.
 
              He takes a few more steps, re-balancing bags, coughs a
              little.  He is a mess, and he knows it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing; loving
                                the dark humor)
                        Hey. I'm back.
 
              She laughs, waves, and exits back into the kitchen.  She
              regards the poker still in her hand. Laurel watches her
              conflicted, slightly lovesick sister.
 
              INT. CAB -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in the back of the cab.  He turns for a moment, looking
              back at the warm house he's just left. Something is
              scratching at his soul, trying to get in. Music continues. He
              was strangely comfortable there, as the house disappears from
              his view.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. TEMPE PRACTICE AREA -- DAY
 
              Rod Tidwell races to catch up to a wobbly, overthrown pass.
              He snags it out of the air, and moves gracefully downfield.
              He turns back to shout at the quarterback for the wobbly
              pass, and slams into a padding post.  Dennis Wilburn, the GM
              we met earlier, crosses in front of Maguire, giving him a
              look.  Maguire forges ahead anyway.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We gotta talk about his contract,
                        Dennis.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        Your timing is impeccable,
                        Maguire. Gee, I can't imagine how
                        you ever lost Cush...


                                                                     81.
 
 
              Wilburn moves on, scoffing loudly.
 
              INT. LOCKER ROOM SHOWER AREA -- DAY
 
              Jerry stands in pre-season locker-room.   Off-stage we hear
              a shower.  In the b.g., one of those locker-room psych-up
              signs like: Injuries happen first in the mind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I started talking with Dennis
                        Wilburn about your renegotation.
 
              Rod emerges naked, dripping wet, pissed.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Did you tell him about the "ten
                        million for four years?"
 
                                  JERRY
                        Uh, not today, but --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre
                        Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools,
                        and yet they're making the big
                        sweet dollars. They're making the
                        money, and I got an agent that
                        ain't even put the number on the
                        table.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I understand your anxiety.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Maybe you don't.  Because it's not
                        just the money I deserve.  It's
                        not just the "coin."  It's the...
 
              He says this next word royally, as if it's fine silk.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        --  the kwan.
 
                                  JERRY
                        That's your word?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Yeah, man, it means love, respect,
                        community... and the dollars too.
                        The package.  The kwan.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (impressed)
                        But how did you get "kwan?"


                                                                     82.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        I got there from "coin," dude.
                        Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Great word.  Towel?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No, I air-dry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, I say this with great
                        respect, but those players you
                        mentioned are marquee players
                        and --
 
              A portable phone beeps.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Is that your porty or mine?
 
                                  JERRY
                        You.
 
              Tidwell rummages in his bag.  Finds one of two porties and
              answers the one with a Polaroid of Marcee taped to it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hi baby. Yeah, I'm just breakin'
                        in the new agent.  He says I'm not
                        marquee.  I know... I know...
 
              Tidwell holds up the phone so Jerry can hear the sound of
              Marcee going off.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        My wife is upset with you.
 
              INT. LOCKER ROOM MIRROR -- DAY
 
              The conversation continues as Tidwell fixes hair in the
              mirror. Jerry  speaks  to  the  reflection,  taking  him  on,
              gesturing passionately.  Tidwell, still naked, may or may not
              be listening.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Here's what I'm saying.  This is
                        a renegotiation.  We want more
                        from them, so let's show them more
                        from us. Let's show them your pure
                        joy of the game, let's bury the
                        Attitude a little, let's show
                        them --


                                                                     83.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        You're telling me to dance.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm saying to be --
 
              He mimes a dainty little showboat-touchdown dance.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (little voice)
                        "Love me love me love me... put me
                        on t.v."
                               (pissed)
                        That's the iconography of rascism,
                        man!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm
                        telling you to be the best version
                        of you, to get back to the guy who
                        first started playing this game.
                        Way back when you were a kid.  It
                        wasn't just about the money, was
                        it?
 
              Tidwell gives him a look.  Money was always a factor.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Do your job, man, don't tell me to
                        dance.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Fine.
 
              He begins gathering his things.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm an athlete, not an
                        entertainer. These are the ABC's
                        of ME.  Get it? I don't dance.
 
              Jerry rubs face.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        What's wrong.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Forget it.  Forget it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No tell me.


                                                                     84.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm out here for you!  You don't
                        know what it's like to be me out
                        here for you. It is an up-at-dawn
                        pride-swallowing seige that I will
                        never fully tell you about! Okay?!
                        Help me help you help me help you.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You're hanging by a very thin
                        thread, dude.  And I dig that
                        about you.
 
              Jerry has had enough for one day.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (loopy, punch-drunk,
                                arms flailing)
                        Hey.  I'm happy to entertain you!
                        I'll see you in L.A.!
 
              Tidwell watches his agent lurch off, muttering and swaying.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        See, man, that's the difference.
                        between us.  You think we're
                        fighting, I think we're finally
                        talking!
 
              INT. LAX AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry moves slowly through crowded airport, preoccupied with
              thought.
 
              INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
 
              Jerry enters, carrying bags, weary.  Dorothy greets him. They
              are stuck in his small condo, and the scent of their previous
              encounter is still in the air.  She hands him a list of his
              calls.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona
                        to say he's faxing in the new
                        Tidwell offer on Thursday morning,
                        and you'll be happy.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (jolted into
                                happiness)
                        Happy. He said "happy?"
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Actually he said "glad."


                                                                     85.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Plus, you could use that
                        commission.
 
              She hands him a financial report she's done.  He takes a
              quick look, seeing the thorough work she's already done.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I sunk most of what I had into
                        this condo, which devalued, and --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        You don't have to explain.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, the other night, I want to
                        apologize.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (can't read her)
                        Yeah, what happened there.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We're two people working together
                        and we can't have an atmosphere.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'm relieved you said that.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I mean, the other night was... I
                        felt like you understood something
                        I could barely even say, something
                        way down deep in the murk --
                               (beat)
                        -- but we have a company here to
                        think about.  I won't ever take
                        advantage of you in that way again.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (evenly)
                        Oh good.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You walked out on a job for me,
                        and I won't ruin that.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Exactly because I know this is a
                        time when you need to be alone
                        with your thoughts.
                                  (more)


                                                                     86.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        Think about everything that's gone
                        wrong, how to fix them, and just
                        be... alone, alone, alone.
 
              Dorothy in the background of the shot, watching his reaction.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want to go out to dinner?
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
 
              Dorothy looks for a jacket as Laurel helms the Divorced
              Women's group in the living room.  Jan speaks through her
              whistly braces, gesturing with a too-full glass of red wine.
 
                                  JAN
                        I broke up with the Cowboy. And
                        now he's stalking me...
 
                                  ALICE
                        What's the current definition of
                        stalking?
 
                                  WOMAN # 1
                        Coming over uninvited.
 
                                  JAN
                               (thoughtful)
                        So Romeo under the trellis... was
                        a stalker.
 
              Meaningful sounds of revelation, as Dorothy finds the jacket.
 
              INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy stops in the hallway to see that Jerry Maguire has
              arrived at the back-kitchen door.  She watches unseen as
              Maguire shakes hands with Chad the Nanny and is hit suddenly
              by a flying hug from Ray.  He gives the kid an athletic bag,
              which is filled with state-of-the-art promotional athletic
              wear, etc. ("Brought you some swag.")  Ray continues hugging
              Jerry.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry is a little embarrassed by the affections of the kid.
              Dorothy enters.  Expertly breezy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey, looks like you've got a fan.


                                                                     87.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (outdressed)
                        Wow.  That's more than a dress.
                        That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Yeah -- guess I got revved up at
                        the idea of an evening among
                        adults -- no offense buster.
                               (then)
                        You meet Chad the nanny?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay?
                        I guess I didn't realize we were...
 
              He doesn't finish the words "going out on a date."  The
              cacaphony of the Boyd home swirls around Maguire.  It's a new
              sensation for this bachelor.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't let him stay up too late.
 
                                  CHAD
                               (grandly)
                        Hey, man, tonight I'm going to
                        teach Ray about jazz.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good, that'll put him to sleep
                        early. No offense.
 
              She twirls toward the door, grabbing her purse.
 
                                  CHAD
                        You know, you people have a jazz
                        problem in this house.
 
              Laurel enters, adding to the chaos, adlibbing hellos.
 
                                  RAY
                        I wanna go too.
 
              Laurel gives Ray a look.  Ray backs down, as Jerry hears
              snatches of the Women's group going full blast in the living
              room.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Bye you guys.


                                                                     88.
 
 
              Ray extends his arms, he wants a hug.  Jerry bends down
              awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's
              cheek.  All are surprised, especially Jerry.  Dorothy is
              struck and moved.  Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit
              with wonder. Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees
              one.
 
              INT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT
 
              Laurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting. She
              is equal parts jealous and protective.  She spots keys on
              counter. She grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on
              the lawn. "All Shook Down."  Replacements.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see
              are parked on the street and the front lawn.  The sound of
              the Women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind
              them.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Hey!
 
              As Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can
              have privacy with her sister.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (continuing)
                        Forgot your keys --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (privately)
                        That's the first time I ever saw
                        him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't
                        that just... thrilling?
                               (eyes tear up)
                        I mean, he must have been needing
                        that.
 
              Women's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to
              glue her emotional sister back together.  She holds her arm.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        No no.  Don't cry at the beginning
                        of the date.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (laughing, wiping
                                tear)
                        Oh, knock it off!


                                                                     89.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (can't help it)
                        And don't be a shoulder for him to
                        cry on either.
 
              We stay with Laurel as she watches her sister exit.   Music
              continues.  Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young
              girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood,
              slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the
              street.
 
              INT. ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy sit at the table of this Mexican
              restaurant. In the background, Mariachis play.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It was laziness1 my whole breakup
                        with Avery. You know that thing
                        you say, "it's nobody's fault."
                        It's one of the great lies, right?
                        Someone is always to blame -- if
                        you go for it, go for it like you
                        do a job, work at it --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Maybe love shouldn't be such hard
                        work. I know, but --
 
              Mariachis approach the table.
 
                                  HEAD MARIACHI
                        A song for the lovers?
 
                                  JERRY/DOROTHY
                               (too quickly)
                        No.  No thanks.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We work together.
 
              Jerry slips the guy a few bucks to go away. They do so,
              reluctantly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        See, you choose. If you fall for
                        someone, if you make a commitment,
                        you should make it work.  It's
                        only when "options" entered the
                        picture that things got bad. I'm
                        speaking historically now.  It's
                        a modern day concept,
                        nueroticism -- how do I feeeeeel?
                        -- I think the only good thing to
                                  (more)


                                                                     90.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        come from this period in history
                        is probably the movie "Annie Hall."
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (evenly)
                        Maybe you should call her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no no.  I just underestimated
                        her...
                               (touches wound)
                        her temper, I guess.  Why are we
                        even talking about this?
 
              A FLOWER GIRL approaches the table with an armful of roses.
 
                                  FLOWER GIRL
                        A rose for the lady.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want a --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        (   (scoffs)
                        No.  No way.
 
              Jerry gives her few bucks, she exits.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage
                        to Roger was so great, even
                        before --
                               (stops herself)
                        Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (simply)
                        Let's not tell our sad stories.
 
              Jerry laughs to himself. He admires her directness.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I'll be right back. Quit thinking
                        those murky thoughts, okay? We're
                        young, we're semi-successful. Life
                        is good.
 
              She exits and we hang on him for a moment.


                                                                     91.
 
 
              INT. BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER
 
              Dorothy on the phone outside the bathroom.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No, now... come on... let Chad
                        catch the bee in a glass.  He
                        won't hurt it. Aw, buddy, you got
                        such a good heart. I love you,
                        I'll be home soon.  Can't wait to
                        see you.
 
              EXT. BATHROOM
 
              Sbe exits the bathroom and stops at the sight of what is
              happening at the table. Jerry, hand on face, is
              embarrassingly being serenaded by the Mariachis, who now play
              a mournful "Tears in Heaven."  She smiles at the image, in
              fact the poetry charms her. Dorothy moves forward, grinning,
              fishes some bucks out of her pocket, and sends the Mariachis
              in another direction.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Come on, let's take a walk.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Music feathers into sounds of night.  A bug buzzing from the
              nearby light, Jerry swats it away.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well -- this would be goodnight.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good night.
 
              They don't kiss.  They take great care not to touch too much.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll see you tomorrow.
 
              They don't move. On impulse, she grabs him and pulls him
              close. Kisses him.  It's a good one.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good night.
 
              But they don't move.  He pulls her closer by her straps.
              They break.  She holds them up, nervous now. His lips travel
              down. He kisses her upper chest. She sighs deeply, she's
              missed this feeling.  Jerry rises to kiss her lips again,
              tying her straps back on. Her expression says there is a
              decision to make. She concentrates on the styrofoam container
              she's brought back from the restaurant.


                                                                     92.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing; breath)
                        I think you should not come in, or
                        come in depending on how you feel.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Same to you.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Right.  I'll come in.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay. Wait here a second.
                               (beat, then)
                        Do we really want to do this?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (half-unsure)
                        Oh hell yes.
 
              She exits, as shot lingers on Jerry.  That odd moment when
              you've crossed the line.  He takes a breath.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy enters to find Chad watching t.v.  The house is now
              quiet, the remains of the Divorced Women's group is still in
              evidence.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's asleep, right?
 
                                  CHAD
                        Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Still going.
 
              Chad raises his eyebrows.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Shhh.
 
              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry on the porch, as Chad exits.  Chad now fully plays the
              part of friend with seniority.  Looks the taller Jerry up and
              down.
 
                                  CHAD
                        Treat her right, man.  She's...


                                                                     93.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (self-conscious)
                        Yeah... well...
 
                                  CHAD
                        She's great.  And I know this is
                        a little awkward, but I want you
                        to use this.
 
              Chad ruumages in bag for a moment.  Jerry is somewhat
              horrified at what Chad might be giving him.  Out comes a
              cassette tape.
 
                                  CHAD
                               (continuing; intense)
                        This... is Miles Davis and John
                        Coltrane. Stockholm.  1963... two
                        masters of freedom, playing in a
                        time before their art was
                        corrupted by a zillion cocktail
                        lounge performers who destroyed
                        the legacy of the only American
                        artform -- JAZZ.
 
              Jerry takes the tape, as the front door squeaks open.
              Dorothy shoos Chad away, quietly leads Jerry inside.
 
              INT. BEDROOM-- NIGHT
 
              Fierce, driving jazz. Dorothy and Jerry making out on bed.
              Getting hotter. The music gets wilder. Finally it is
              impossible to ignore, and Jerry collapses backwards on the
              bed laughing.  She is left frozen, her arms open but he is
              gone.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What is this MUSIC?
 
              They both crack up, and she kisses him as the music plays. He
              looks at her. She turns away, then back again, he's still
              looking at her. It's a powerful moment for her.  Laughter
              continues, the music is ridiculous. (Their sex is a big
              difference from the let's-be-intense sex with Avery.)
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME
 
              Laurel just home from work in nurse uniform, has a late-night
              joint and carefully blows the smoke out the window.  Laughter
              from the next room.  She pops open the styrofoam appetizers
              her sister brought back from dinner.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


                                                                     94.
 
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
 
              Radio clicks on.  It's still dark.  Only the glow of the
              digital lamp.  Jerry alone in bed.  He gets up, coughs, pulls
              on some pants.  Manuevers through a strange bedroom, steps on
              toys.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
 
              Dorothy and Laurel in the kitchen, waiting far the first
              possible drops of coffee.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'm getting him up, don't worry.'
                        Ray will never see his mother's
                        raging physical needs.
 
              She starts to exit, but Laurel pulls her back far a second.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        First you gotta tell me something.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No--
 
              INT. HALLWAY -- MORNING
 
              Jerry moving dawn the hallway, hears voices.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Because I'm worried that you're
                        putting your faith in this guy
                        who, because of the way things are
                        going, may not have an emotional
                        marble in his head.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Please, if I start talking --
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Guys are just different people
                        when they're hanging onto the
                        bottom rung.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              listening.  Pinned to the wall, listening to the kind of
              honesty an agent rarely hears.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        ... so what am I, for taking the
                        opportunity, Laurel?
                                  (more)


                                                                     95.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        Maybe I am taking advantage.  Am
                        I a bad person? All I know is that
                        I found someone who was charming
                        and popular and not-so-nice to
                        me -- and he died.  Okay?  So why
                        should I let this guy go, when
                        everything in my body says This
                        One is The One.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Easy, hon, I was just looking for
                        fun details --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
                        And oh, I don't know if you're
                        interested in this detail, but I
                        was just about to tell you that I
                        love him.  I love him, and I don't
                        care what you think.  I love him
                        for the guy he wants to be, and I
                        love him for the guy he almost is.
                        I love him.
 
              They look at each other. The cat is way, way out of the bag.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              rubbing his face.
 
                                  RAY
                        Hi Jerry!
 
              Dorothy leans into the hallway now, sees Jerry standing
              there, well within earshot.  As Ray pounds down the hallway
              in his new over-sized shirt, brought by Jerry, Dorothy begins
              to crumble. The lack of control in her life is overwhelming
              her.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh God.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Easy, easy --
 
              Jerry enters the kitchen, stands near Laurel.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I could pretend I didn't hear, but
                        I won't, I heard everything.
                               (to Laurel)
                        Thank you for your honesty, as
                        always.


                                                                     96.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (frozen polite)
                        Coffee, Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh, no thanks.  We bottom-feeders
                        prefer cereal first --
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's have Apple Jacks!
 
              Apple Jacks it is.  Dorothy, good morning, darling. He kisses
              her on the cheek, in full view of Ray.  Dorothy, still
              embarrassed, not sure what is going on, reaches for cereal.
              Jerry sits down for breakfast.  They are an odd, but fairly
              complete-looking family.
 
                                  RAY
                               (continuing)
                        What's going on, Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        A lot.  We got a big fax today...
                        we need this commission, buddy.
 
              The sisters look at each other.  Ray looks around, he feels
              happy, but there is something else in the room.  He shrugs
              and continues to feel happy.
 
              INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
 
              Jerry and Dorothy prepare for the Tidwells, cleaning up the
              cramped office, unstacking chairs and making room.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        That was great of you this morning.
 
              The Tidwells honk, arriving in the driveway.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (friendly, dismissive)
                        Look, let's just root for a big
                        offer so we can move out of this
                        room to a real office.
 
              She feels slightly slapped down, but covers.  She opens a
              window quickly, and busies herself with the clutter at hand.
 
              ON FAX
 
              Connecting.


                                                                     97.
 
 
              FOUR FACES
 
              waiting for the results.  Everybody has a stake in this fax.
              Lives are very clearly hanging on this results.  Marcee shuts
              her eyes.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Read it to me, and don't say
                        anything unless it's over nine.
 
              There is a stunning disappointment on the fax.  Jerry's heart
              sinks.  His face slackens.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw shit --
 
              Rod turns away.  Dorothy shuts her eyes, as Marcee opens hers.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        One-point-seven for three years.
                        That's below average.  We owe more
                        than that...
 
              It is so very painful for her, as Tidwell slinks off to sit
              in a seat too small for him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll go back to them.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (explodes)
                        And say what?  "Please remove your
                        dick from my ass?!"
 
              Both men look at her. The outburst has surprised even Marcee.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        I'm sorry.  I'm a little pregnant
                        right now.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I feel like crying.  I feel like
                        breaking the room up.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, we don't take this
                        emotionally. We roll with this
                        problem.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What are you talking about --
                        "don't get emotional." If you ask
                        me, you haven't gotten emotional
                        ENOUGH about this man.


                                                                     98.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What DO you stand for???
 
              Dorothy looks right and left, can't hold back.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        How about a little piece of
                        integrity in this world that is so
                        filled with greed and a lack of
                        honorability that I don't know
                        what to tell my kid except take a
                        look at a guy who isn't shouting
                        "show me the money," he's quietly
                        broke and working for you for free!
                               (off Jerry's pained
                                look)
                        Well, I'm sorry, I'm not as good
                        at the insults as she is.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        No, that was pretty good.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (impressed)
                        No shit.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        In fact, you should read something
                        that meant the world to me...
 
              She opens a drawer, and withdraws the Mission Statement. She
              is headed across the room to give it to Marcee, when Jerry
              swiftly intercepts it.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Another time, okay Dorothy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Fine, I just --
 
                                  JERRY
                        And I appreciate that impulse.
 
              Jerry throws the Mission Statement into a bottom drawer.
              Camera moves to Tidwell, and we see him for the first time
              without his protective shield of attitude.  Scared.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Tell me what to do, Jerry.  You
                        tell me to eat lima beans, I'll
                        eat lima beans.

                                  TIDWELL (cont'd)
                        If you say take the shitty deal,
                        that's all we can get --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        "All we can get?"
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Can I SPEAK with my agent here?
 
              Marcee is passionate.  Focused on Rod.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        You know what you're qonna do,
                        Rodney. You're gonna reject this
                        shitty contract. You're gonna play
                        out your existihg shitty contract
                        and go be a free agent next year
                        and the hell with Arizona. This is
                        us, and we determine our worth.
                        You're a fine, proud, surviving,
                        splendid black man.
 
              Beat.  Truer words...  The big man looks into his wife's eyes.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Honey, you are just --
 
              No one else in the world exists.  They are focused totally on
              each other.  Jerry and Dorothy in the background, just
              watching the intricate machinery of this marriage.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        -- the shit.
 
              She caresses the back of his neck.  He pulls her to him.  He
              gives her a small kiss.  Dorothy and Jerry look at the
              couple, fascinated and somewhat uncomfortable.  There is a
              palpable forcefield around the Tidwells.  They are a couple
              in every passionate sense of the word.  After a beat:
 
                                  JERRY
                        If you get injured, you get
                        nothing.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Won't happen.  I'm strong in my
                        mind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a risk.
 
              Jerry looks over to Dorothy, who grits her teeth at the
              implications of the decision.


                                                                     100.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Bet on me, dude.  Bet on me like
                        I bet on you.
 
              Tidwell puts his hand out.  Maguire is conflicted, but he
              takes a breath and shakes.
 
              EXT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON
 
              Tidwell and Marcee exit.  Dorothy and Jerry on the lawn.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll get you some quick work --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good deal, man.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I'm sorry what I said back there.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't be silly.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        My husband believes in you.  We're
                        gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Take care you guys.
 
              Tidwells exit.  Finally, Dorothy and Jerry are alone.  The
              Tidwell situation has left an ominious feeling in the air.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Look...  I was up for a job in San
                        Diego before I left SMI. It's with
                        the Chargers.

                                  JERRY
                        Don't even talk about that yet.
                        I'll find something fast for
                        Tidwell. We'll stay afloat.
 
              EXT. COMMERCIAL SET/TAYLOR CHEVROLET/ARIZONA -- DAY
 
              Tidwell stands on the set of a regional Arizona car
              commercial. It is a hot day.  Three other bored, large
              Arizona athletes wait by a coffee machine, as Jerry's friend,
              director Bill Dooler appears ready to implode.  Dooler is
              arguing with Tidwell.


                                                                     101.
 
 
              Maguire stands slightly away, acting as referee.  Nearby, a
              camel.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Bill, Rod, wait --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Dude, know your art form.  If you
                        put the camera down here, looking
                        up, I look more powerful.  There's
                        no need for a camel... you got ME.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, get on the camel.
 
                                  DOOLER
                               (shoots look to Jerry)
                        The sponsor wants a camel --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Jerry, back me up.  It's either
                        the camel or me...
 
              Tidwell waves his arms, spooking the camel, who spits and
              stormps. Several crew members scatter in various directions.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (takes the bullet)
                        Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him
                        out of this.  This isn't what I
                        had in mind anyway.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Then you shouldn't have begged me
                        to hire him.
 
              EXT. SET -- LATER
 
              Jerry and Tidwell walk quickly from the set.  In the
              background, another athlete rides the camel.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        There you go, dude.  You're
                        learning how to represent me.  We
                        ain't gonna bring Nike to their
                        knees with some regional camel
                        ad --
 
              Jerry rubs his face.


                                                                     102.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Can I ask you a question totally
                        unrelated to your career?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh, we gonna be friends now?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What do you know about dating a
                        single mother?
 
              Tidwell warms to the personal question.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by
                        a single mother.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tell me, because it's been a
                        month, and she's about to take
                        another job in San Diego.
 
              Tidwell is always happy to hold forth.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        First, single mothers don't
                        "date." They have been to the
                        circus, you know what I'm saying?
                        They have been to the puppet show
                        and they have seen the strings.
                        You love her?
 
                                  JERRY
                        How do I know?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You know when you know.  It makes
                        you shivver, it eats at your
                        insides. You know?
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I don't know.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Then you gotta have The Talk.
 
                                  JERRY
                        But I sure don't like that she's
                        leaving.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, that ain't fair to her.  A
                        single mother, that's a sacred
                        thing, man.


                                                                     103.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        The kid is amazing.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (shaking head)
                        No.  A real man does not shoplift
                        the "pooty" from a single mom.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We
                        were thrown together and -- I mean
                        it's two mutual people who --
                               (a look)
                        Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
 
              INT. ZOO -- DAY
 
              Jerry, Dorothy and Ray at the zoo.  Ray straining at Jerry's
              arm. Life-changing decisions in the air.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        They offered me everything I asked
                        for, it's only 2 hours away. I
                        think it's good for us.
 
              Jerry feels tugged in many directions, and not just by Ray.
              They approach the reptile house.
 
                                  RAY
                        Show me the animal, Jerry!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Right up ahead, buddy --
 
              They approach the Reptile House, where a small crowd is
              gathered.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        -- I give you my favorite animal
                        in the zoo.  Are you ready for the
                        weirdness, the strange perfection
                        and truth of...
 
                                  RAY
                        I'm scared.  What is it?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's in a cage.  Do not be scared
                        of...
 
              A few people peel away, revealing...


                                                                     104.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        The Two-Headed Corn Snake.
 
              THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE
 
              A friendly but confused looking reptile.  The snake has two
              heads, both identical, both twisting and battling each other
              for direction.  Aw-ed chatter around the animal ranges from
              "weird" and "wow" to "mira mira!  Dos cabezas!"  Few can turn
              away.
 
                                  RAY
                        Whoa.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (quietly)
                        Two heads.  My God...
 
              Jerry is happy to play tour-guide.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Both heads have brains.  Both
                        heads eat, both heads battle for
                        direction all day long.
                               (meaningful)
                        Man, can I relate.
 
              The odd animal moves forward, fighting itself constantly.
 
                                  RAY
                        Me too.
 
              Dorothy just looks at the two men in her life.  She turns to
              Anonymous Man standing nearby, staring at the animal.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Is this a guy thing?
 
                                  ANONYMOUS MAN
                        It is, and it isn't.
 
              ON THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE
 
              strangely endearing, jittering and moving around the cage.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT YARD -- DAY
 
              A U-Haul is parked in the driveway.  Inside the cab, a very
              sad Ray.  Jerry approaches carefully.  Ray does not look at
              him.  He opens the door, scoots the kid over, and sits next
              to him.


                                                                     105.
 
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
 
              Laurel and Dorothy say goodbye.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        You're doing the right thing. I
                        mean, come on.  You need to start
                        your life and he... he needs a
                        warm body to cushion the fall.
                        Check out exhibit A on the front
                        lawn --
 
              POV -- THE SISTERS
 
              We see Jerry, following Chad back to the house, saying
              goodbye too many times. He's anxious not to be left alone.
              Finally Chad grabs him by the shoulders, says goodbye, as a
              sad Ray trudges to the cab of the U-Haul.  Jerry now follows
              Ray to the car.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S PLACE -- DAY
 
              Jerry scoots a very sad Ray over, and talks to him in the car.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm not good at this.
 
              Ray begins to cry. Jerry is incapable of dealing with it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I'll see you this weekend, okay?
                        Promise.
 
              Ray wails.  Jerry squeezes his shoulder, it does nothing, so
              he exits. He rises and faces Dorothy, keys in hand.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Sure you're okay to drive this?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        This rig? Phht.  No problem.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So I'll see you this weekend.
 
              She accepts it casually, with a shrug.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Airight, so goodbye and --
                               (simple, with shrug)
                        I love you.
 
              Jerry blinks.


                                                                     106.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (too quick, weirdly)
                        ... I love you too, you know.
 
              She reacts with an odd look.  The words don't sound right,
              and he knows that she knows.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        What --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Look, just in case this weekend
                        becomes next month and next month
                        becomes... whatever...
                               (beat)
                        Don't make a joke of your life.
                        Go back and read what you wrote.
                        You're better than the rest of
                        them, better than the Bob Sugars,
                        and don't forget it.
 
              He shudders a little with the intimacy of her words.  She
              kisses him, and moves quickly toward the car, leaving him
              alone in frame. He grows increasingly uncomfortable.  He
              watches her leave.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait a second.
 
              ON DOROTHY
 
              moving to her car.  She hears him.  It's not loud enough for
              her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        WAIT A SECOND!
 
              She stops, smiling very slightly to herself , biting her lip.
              She turns and he is now close to her.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I know a way to s... to save on
                        Medical and rent and... look...
 
              He grips one hand with the other.  Dorothy looks at his
              strange behavior.  He looks over to the cab, where Ray is
              making a sad face at him through the window.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        ...  what if we stayed together?
                        What if we uh... got married.


                                                                     107.
 
 
              She looks at him.  It's an odd proposal.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        If I said that, would you stay?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say
                        that if you don't...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Will you marry me?
 
              She looks at him, full of love, dabbing at her mascara.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S BACKYARD -- DAY
 
              Rod Tidwell sings Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On" at the
              wedding for assorted guests gathered here in the backyard.
              Contrary to his own belief, Rod is not a gifted singer.  In
              the wedding band, standing on a small stage in the corner,
              are Chad and Dooler.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              who stands watching, smile pasted on, with stoic FATHER and
              well-dressed BROTHER.
 
                                  BROTHER
                        Where are all your friends?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (looking around)
                        In the band.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              We are close on Ray now as we hear the sound of a Reverend
              reading wedding vows.  Ray holds the ring, and waits for his
              cue to offer it.  But he has forgotten the cue.  And every
              time the Reverend pauses, he starts to offer the ring.
 
              Dorothy's leg and hand are visible in frame.  She calms him
              with a hand on the shoulder.  And finally the cue comes and
              he offers the ring.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S HALLWAY/KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              The bride and groom catch each other, post-wedding, in the
              hallway of the small home where the event has taken place.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wow.  We actually --


                                                                     108.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, we did.
 
              Giddy, Dorothy heads into the living room where Friends and
              relatives watch the video of the wedding. And now the
              enormity is evident on Jerry's face. Warm laughter in the
              b.g.  More laughter and family noise in the background now.
              He holds onto a table for a moment, steadies himself.  Jerry
              takes a breath and moves into the kitchen.  Finds a beer.  He
              turns and finds himself alone with Laurel, for the first
              time.  She raises her beer.  They toast, warily.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        If you fuck this up, I'll kill you.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (as she exits)
                        Glad we had this talk!
 
              Nearby, Tidwell watches all.  He moves to Jerry.
              Confidentially:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You never had The Talk, did you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        No.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, this was another way to go.
 
              Jerry smiles.  Dorothy brings Jerry a Poloraid someone took,
              and for a moment the couple stands awkwardly together.
              Tidwell rubs Jerry's shoulders a little, announcing to the
              room:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        This is my agent, man!  And we're
                        all gonna have a great season!
 
              He pounds Jerry on the back, hard, shaking him like a pinata.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. PHILADELPHIA PLAYING FIELD -- DAY
 
              Tidwell catches the ball, takes a vicious hit. The season is
              on.
 
              INT. PHILADELPHIA PRESS BOX -- DAY
 
              Across the room, he sees GM Dennis Wilburn standing with
              Avery.


                                                                     109.
 
 
              He turns away, passing a monitor where elsewhere in the
              country, Frank Cushman is having another sensational Sunday.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM/PHOENIX -- DAY
 
              This is the Tidwell family ritual of watching Rod's games on
              the big-screen home t.v.  At the center is Marcee Tidwell.
              Everything flows from her.  Next to her is Tyson, and then
              the cousins, the neighborhood friends.  At this particular
              moment, they are all screaming for Rod, who is taking a
              beating, but is having a hell of a game.  In front of the
              t.v., Tyson does the "Daddy Dance," a dance of pure joy.
 
                                  TYSON
                               (proudly, to family)
                        That's my motherfucker!
 
              Marcee reaches out and collars her dancing son.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Why don't you be the first man in
                        your family not to say that word?
                        And then we'll let you live.
 
              Tyson nods, wide-eyed.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                               (cooly)
                        That's why they cheer, you know.
                        The white man sending the black
                        man into battle...
 
              Marcee shoots him a look, as Tidwell takes another rough hit.
 
              INT. STADIUM HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry stands waiting.  Bob Sugar nearby, greeting quarterback
              JOHN SWENSON.  Still no Tidwell.
 
              EXT. PHILADELPHIA LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Finally, here comes Tidwell, moving very slowly with garmet
              bag.
 
                                  JERRY
                        How's your head? Bubblicious.


                                                                     110.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Tidwell moves to a tan in a
                        wheelchair, signs an autograph and
                        moves on.  Jerry alongside. The
                        quarterback sucks, man.  He's
                        gonna get me killed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm a little worried --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm worried too.  I'm worried that
                        the only reason I'm here getting
                        my brains blown loose is that you
                        weren't asshole enough to get my
                        ten million three months ago.
 
                                  INSANE FAN
                               (interrupting loudly)
                        FUCKIN ROD TIDWELL YOU RULE YOU
                        RULE!  I WON A FUCKIN, A FUCKIN
                        MUG ON YOU IN MY ROTISS...
                        ROTLISS...
 
              With great skill, Tidwell pats the fan and moves him along to
              other tired players.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Peace, my drunken brother.  Ahd
                        don't discuss gambling with me.
 
              Insane fan moves to another player.  Jerry proceeds carefully.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We can still take the offer, Rod.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (stops)
                        No.
 
              Jerry regards his slightly befuddled friend.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, just stay healthy. I will
                        show you the kwan.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        Hey, that's my word, okay?
 
              Tidwell wearily heads for the bus.  Jerry stands in the
              parking lot.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll see you in Arizona.


                                                                     111.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm gonna have the game of my life
                        on Monday Night Football, and show
                        all these motherfuckers.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Take care, okay? You're my entire
                        client roster.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Don't I know.  Now go home to your
                        wife.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What's that supposed to mean?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Why are you even here, man? You
                        could have told me all this over
                        the phone.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I don't know -- how's "dedication"
                        for an answer?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You don't want to go home, do you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm asking you a question --
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, you're --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm trying to talk to you.  How's
                        your marriage?
 
              Jerry looks at Rod for a moment.  It is the simplest
              question, and one in which he has no quick answer.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Not everyone has what you have.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Then why'd you get married?  I'm
                        asking you as a friend.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (shaking his head)
                        You're jabbing at me.


                                                                     112.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm sorry I asked.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm going to answer you.  You
                        want an answer?  I'll give it to
                        you.
                               (beat)
                        Loyalty.  She was loyal.
                               (unconvincing)
                        Everything grew from there.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        That's an answer.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Damn right.

                        For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For

                                  JERRY
                        Look.  I'm happy to entertain you,
                        as always, but I have a question
                        for you.  Are we really "friends?"
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Why not --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, friends can tell each other
                        anything, right? If we have our
                        "friends" hats on --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (wary)
                        I think so.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (intense)
                        Airight.  Here's why you don't
                        have your ten million dollars yet.
                        You are a paycheck player.  You
                        play with your head.  Not your
                        heart.  In your personal life?
                               (points)

                        -- you're a businessman.  It's
                        wide-angle lenses and who fucked
                        you over and who owes you for it.
                        That's not what inspires people.
                        I'm sorry, but that's the truth,
                        can you handle it? Just a
                        "question," Rod.  Between friends.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I don't want to be friends anymore.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Fine.

                        We still having dinner in L.A.?

                        Only 'cause my wife likes your
                        wife!
 
              Jerry exits.  Tidwell is pissed.  And hurt.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        "No heart."  "No heart?"
                               (yells after him)
                        I'm all heart, motherfucker!
 
              He gets on the bus.
 
              INT. CRAB RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
 
              The Tidwells and the Maguires.  Tyson and Ray run around the
              table of this family-style restaurant. Marcee is very very
              pregnant. They crack crabs for each other, seasoning for each
              other, feeding each other like one many-armed and loving body.

                        -- TWENTY minutes of coming
                        attractions. All black films, all
                        violent, I'm talking about
                        brothers shooting brothers, Wesley
                        Snipes with guns the size of our
                        house, killing, blood flowing,
                        cars crashing... blood blood blood
                        blood. Is this all they think we
                        want to see? Come on!  I enjoyed
                        Shindler's List.  Give me a little

              Sitting across the table, stunned, just watching this
              intricate and perfect marriage.
 
              SHOT OF MARCEE
 
              She takes a breath and gets a weird look.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        What baby?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Baby.  Baby.  Baby...
 
              INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Marcee gives birth, Rod assisting.  Jerry and Dorothy watch
              from behind thick glass.  She hangs her arm on his shoulder,
              looks at him.  Jerry stares straight ahead. Mortified, with
              dry throat.
 
              INT. DOROTHY AND JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy exhausted, alone, getting ready for bed.
              Dorothy sits down near him on the bed.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What were you thinking tonight?
                        Watching them go through the
                        complete human emotional
                        experience?


                                                                     115.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I was thinking I hope he doesn't
                        get injured. I felt responsible.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sometimes I can't tell at all,
                        what's going through that head of
                        yours.
 
              He makes a noise. As in -- it's no big mystery.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        And I really don't know your
                        noises yet.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, when you wonder, ask me.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (unsatisfied)

              Beat.  He feels inadequate.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why do you love me?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Why do you love me?
 
              It is, of course, the better question.  And before he can
              answer, there is a pounding at the door.
 
                                  RAY
                        Jerry, can I come in and watch
                        t.v.?
 
                           DOROTHY                       JERRY
                   I'll come visit you in a      Just for a few minutes,
                   second --                     buddy --
 
              The door flies open and Ray comes bounding in, onto the bed,
              stations himself in the center and begins wrestling Jerry for
              the remote control.  Dorothy watches, disconnected.  A
              steeliness comes over her that we have not yet seen.
 
              INT. PRESCHOOL -- NEXT DAY
 
              Dorothy drops Ray at preschool, and stands in the doorway of
              the playroom.  She watches the boys and girls playing
              together in a room full of bright colors and games.  Music.

              EXT. RAY'S PLAYHOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry sits finishing a phone call to an advertising account
              exec. He has come here, to Ray's playhouse for privacy.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tonight.  Yeah, the red-eye, I'll
                        be in Arizona on Monday...
 
              Jerry adlibs some salesmanship on Tidwell's behalf.   Dorothy
              approaches.  She gives him a few phone messages, sits down.
              Beat of silence.  He sees a look on her face that is
              unfamiliar.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's my fault.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's not fair to you.  This

                        Tell me -- let me help --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I took advantage of you and worst
                        of all, I'm not alone. I did this
                        with a kid.  I was just on some
                        ride where I thought I was in 1ove
                        enough for both of us.  I did
                        this.  And at least I can do
                        something about it now.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (damage control)
                        Well -- I'm not the guy who's
                        going to run.  I stick.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I don't need you to "stick."
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want...
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I don't know --

                                  DOROTHY
                        Why fucking not!  I deserve it.

                        Dorothy -- what if I'm just not
                        built that way?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I think we made a mistake here.
 
              But now he can't stop.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What if it's true?  "Great at
                        friendship bad at intimacy." I
                        mean, come on.  It's the theme of
                        my bachelor film --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I know.  I watched it.  I sort of
                        know it by heart.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (absorbs it)
                        I don't like to give up.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh please.  My need to make the
                        best of things, and your need to
                        be what, "responsible"... if one
                        of us doesn't say something now we
                        might lose ten years being polite
                        about it. Why don't we call this
                        next road trip what it is.  A nice
                        long break.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What about Ray?
 
              She notes the only real glimpse of ache, in that question.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        There's no question you'll be
                        friends. Of course you'll be
                        friends.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So this break... is a break-up.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Come on, Jerry.  You know this
                        isn't easy for me.
                                  (more)


                                                                     118.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        I mean, on the surface, you'd
                        almost think everything was fine.
                        See, I've got this great guy who
                        loves my kid --
                               (resolute, no tears)
                        -- and he sure does like me a lot.
 
              Jerry Maguire, a man who speaks for a living, has nothing to
              say.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I can't live that way.  It's not
                        the way I'm "built."
 
              He moves to embrace her.  She pulls away first.
 
              INT. RAY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry kisses sleepy Ray goodbye.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't wake up...
 
              And then faces the exotic fish who now resides on Ray's
              table.  He once lived in a tank the size of a Cadillac.  The
              fish now hangs in a too-small bowl, looking at him.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing;
                                defensive)
                        ...  it was just a Mission
                        Statement...
 
              INT. AIRPORT --  DAY
 
              Jerry Maguire stretches his arms out.  A security wand passes
              over him.  Deadness in his eyes. The glaze of the road on
              him.  Music.
 
              EXT. SUN DEVIL STADIUM -- ARIZONA
 
              We are hovering in the sky, just above Sun Devil Stadium.
 
              The classic Monday Night Football shot from the blimp.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Tidwell's family in the living room.  A buzz in the air.  The
              pregame show is on, sound-muted. Old-school on the stereo.
              Everybody is happy.  Marcee sits in the position of honor,
              her new baby KAYDEE in her arms.   She is a tired mother, and
              the family celebrates her.


                                                                     119.
 
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He'd better not mess up on Monday
                        Night Football.
 
              Marcee shoots Tee Pee a look.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                               (continuing)
                        What did I say?  He gets nervous
                        for the t.v. games... it's not a
                        secret.
 
              INT. TUNNEL AREA/PRE-GAME -- NIGHT
 
              Nervous Tidwell chews a toothpick as he stands checking out
              the field.  Nearby, some cheerleaders and a man in a Pickle
              suit.
 
                                  PICKLE MAN
                        Nothing like Monday Night, huh?
                        What is it, 2 billion viewers?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        Shouldn't you be out there doing
                        some pickle dance or something --
                        Pickle Man nods and goes out to
                        dance for the crowd.
 
                                  VOICE
                        Hey Rod -- hey Buddydude --
 
              Tidwell turns.  It's Bob Sugar approaching. Laser-like, ready
              to feed on his insecurity.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Listen, I spoke to your
                        quarterback. He's my client, you
                        know.  And I said, "take care to
                        get those passes down, let Tidwell
                        look good on t.v."
 
              Tidwell looks at him, chews his toothpick.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        You should let me do more for you.
                        I would have had you your deal by
                        tonight.  Al Michaels is a friend
                        of mine. I would have had him on
                        the air, talking about you,
                        tonight, when it counts.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Get outta here.  Go.


                                                                     120.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Where's your agent tonight?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Don't know.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Rod.  I know this is "uncool" to
                        do this now, but you belong with
                        the big boys.  You belong with the
                        money. You belong with --
 
              Here comes Jerry Maguire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Get the fuck away from my guy,
                        Sugar.
 
              Tidwell can't help it.  He beams as he sees his agent
              approach.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Jerry!  You made it --
 
                                  JERRY
                               (off Sugar)
                        Go.  Flee.
 
              Sugar retreats, offering one final look to Rod, think about
              what I said.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Thanks for coming.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (bittersweet)
                        I missed ya.  What can I say?
 
              INT. TIDWELL HOME -- NIGHT
 
              They watch the game.
 
                                  GIFFORD (ON T.V.)
                        It's a bruiser out there tonight.
 
                                  MICHAELS (ON T.V.)
                        Arizona refusing to go into the
                        quiet night of this rough football
                        season. Come on, I'm trying to be
                        poetic here.
 
              Tidwell takes a rough hit, and they respond loudly.


                                                                     121.
 
 
                                  DIERDORF (ON T.V.)
                        Ooof.  Another rough hit across
                        the middle on Rod Tidwell.
                        Nothing poetic about that.
 
              INT. PRESS BOX -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire moves through the box.
 
              INT. FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              Tidwell takes a hit.  Hangs onto the ball.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              The Tidwell clan are banging on t.v. trays and whooping
              loudly. But in the middle of the cheers, Marcee sees the
              unsettled look on young Tyson's face.   She pulls him over to
              her, giving him preference over baby Kaydee.  He is the only
              thing in her world, as she says:
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What does daddy say?
 
                                  TYSON
                        "It looks worse than it is...
 
              Marcee gives him a kiss, as Tidwell makes another grueling
              gain on the field.
 
                                  FRANK GIFFORD'S VOICE
                        They don't pay enough for a man to
                        take that kind of ugly hit --
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (to others)
                        Boy, no s-h-i-t.
 
              Big laughs from the living room.  Except Tee Pee.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He's gonna have nothing left for
                        next season.  They're letting him
                        kill himself.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Can you be quiet?
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        What'd I say?
 
              INT. PRESS BOX -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire watches as Arizona's quarterback John Swenson drops
              back for a pass, and is sacked.


                                                                     122.
 
 
              Philadelphia fans cheer wildly.  The game is turning uglier
              by the minute.  Jerry looks up to the monitor for a closet
              look at the next play.
 
              ON PRESS BOX MONITOR
 
              Swenson, the Arizona quarterback, throws a wobbly pass into
              the end-zone.  Tidwell leaps for the catch, tucks the ball in
              and is promptly and brutally hit by two defenders from two
              different sides.  This hit is bad.  Worse than bad.  Tidwell
              flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes, with a thud,
              ball still in his hands. His head hits the astroturf, hard.
              Tidwell is out cold.  And the ripple effect of the injury
              shoots through the stadium.  Jerry stares at the monitor,
              stunned by the sudden brutality.
 
              EXT. ARIZONA FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              We are thrust into the vortex, inside the game.  Tidwell lies
              still on turf.  Overhead, the fight music continues for a few
              seconds before disappearing abruptly. Players and coaches
              begin to gather around the still body of Rod Tidwell.
 
              TV MONITOR -- SLO-MO
 
              The hit in replay.  It is brutal.  And we can see a flash of
              his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two
              bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side.  One
              cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body
              literally flips.  The second defender then hits him at the
              shoulders.  Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling
              downwards.  Still holding the ball.  Still.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Silence.  Utter silence.
 
                                  GIFFORD'S VOICE
                        --   you sure hope his family
                        wasn't watching that.
 
              And then, in a cry that gurgles from way down deep, Marcee
              begins to sob.  Camera catches the face of Tyson, now
              panicked.  Scared, he embraces his mother.
 
              INT. BOWELS OF SUN DEVIL STADIUM
 
              Maguire sprints through the inner bowels of the stadium.  He
              turns the corner, into the tunnel, talking his way past a
              guard, heading into the bright t.v. light of the football
              field.


                                                                     123.
 
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Gathering around the television, the family waits through a
              commercial for more information on Rod's injury.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He should have kept his head
                        tucked down.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (immediately)
                        Shut up!!!
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        I'm not putting him down, I just
                        have a commitment to the truth.
 
              Marcee lunges for him.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Can't you be loyal to your brother
                        who LOVES you??
                               (she is held back)
                        Get out of my house!
 
              Across the room, the phone starts ringing.  A COUSIN answers.
 
                                  COUSIN
                        It's Jerry Maguire!
 
              EXT. ARIZONA FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry Maguire on the portable.
 
                                  JERRY
                        He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Keep the phone open.  I'll call
                        back. Stay calm. He's got some
                        good doctors out there.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        "Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Alright, I'm freaking too.  But
                        they need you to stay calm.  I'll
                        call back.


                                                                     124.
 
 
                                  MARCEE
                        My whole life is this family,
                        Jerry. It doesn't work without him.
 
              She takes a big gulp, as Jerry watches an overzealous Trainer
              run out onto the field to join the cluster around the fallen
              Tidwell. Jerry covers phone and yells onto the field.
 
                                  JERRY
                        DON'T TOUCH HIM!!!
 
              EXT. CENTER OF PLAYING FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              We're now just a few inches in front of his peaceful,
              sleeping face.  They are all. YELLING, trying to pull him out.
 
              SHOTS OF NATIONAL TELEVISION AUDIENCES
 
              1)   A full sports bar in arizona silently watches Monday
              Night Football.
 
              2)   Generic living room of sports fans, all watching Tidwell
              pinned to the screen.
 
              3)   Generic outdoor bar-b-que as white fans watch t.V.
 
              4)   Tidwell living room.  All gathered around the television.
 
              5)   Maguire straining at the sideline.
 
              ON TIDWELL -- CLOSE
 
              Dead to the world as sound disappears. There is now only
              silence.
 
              POV TIDWELL - SLO-MO -- SILENCE
 
              The Doctors and the Trainers are now truly panicked.  We
              don't hear them.   We see them, their motions increasingly
              manic. Shoving fingers in front of him.  Screaming.  We read
              their lips.  ("Rod!" "Rod can you hear us!")  We see the
              anguish and escalating fear on their faces.  The Trainer
              leans in close, bellowing, he spreads his hands wide to clap
              right in front of Rod's still face.  His hands head toward
              each other... closer... bringing with them the first inkling
              of sound...  getting closer and then finally coming together,
              bringing with him the sounds of the stadium.
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              who blinks back to life.  Concerned men are yelling very
              loudly, right in his face.  Tidwell becomes aware he is the
              absolute center of attention of the entire stadium.  As crowd
              noise begins to rise.


                                                                     125.
 
 
                                  TRAINER
                        Let's get you off the field!
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Wait.
 
                                  TRAINER
                        Can you feel your legs?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Yeah.  Just let me enjoy this for
                        a minute.

              who watches.  Only marginally relieved.  Is he okay?
 
              ON FANS
 
              Crowd noise rises.  Is he okay?
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              Can he move?  Is he okay?
 
              ON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM
 
              Not a breath is taken.  Is he okay?
 
              He rises.  Stadium explodes.  At first on wobbly feet, he
              raises the football and for the first time -- salutes the
              crowd.  Crowd noise doubles.
 
              ON MAGUIRE
 
              gasping for breath.
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              Has never felt like this before in his life.  It is the pure
              and absolute love of the spotlight.  And his fans.
 
              And then... it's real and he feels it.  Tidwell breaks out in
              a small but unmistakable move -- a flutter step.  He does a
              high-stepping move, all his own, for about ten yards.
 
              ON JERRY MAGUIRE
 
              who watches, now in complete disbelief. Tidwell will not let
              go of the spotlight.
 
              ON TIDWELL'S LIVING ROOM
 
              Going absolutely nuts.  Marcee hysterical, laughing and
              crying.


                                                                     126.

                        You ain't talking now, are you???
                        You're a silent motherfucker!
 
              Tyson watches in silent awe of his mother.
 
              BACK ON TIDWELL -- CLOSE
 
              Finishes his small but heartfelt dance.  It is a personal
              catharsis he is sharing now with 2 billion people.

                        Nike.
 
              He moves past Jerry Maguire on his way off the field. Jerry,
              casually thumps his heart twice. Jerry Maguire is overcome
              with emotion.  He sits down on a camera case, head in his
              hands.  Behind him, a stadium cheers a new hero.
 
                                  OVERHEARD FAN
                        I always knew he was great.
 
              Maguire rubs his face.  Overcome. Photographers and others
              rush past to be closer to Tidwell.
 
              INT. TUNNEL -- LATER
 
              Jerry Maguire surrounded by well-wishers and backslappers and
              Sportswriters.  Success has returned, in all of it's
              superficial grandeur.  He is a star again, by association.
              We catch the look on Maguire's face.  Try as he might, he
              can't manufacture the joy of the moment.  There is a void.
              Over the heads of the heatseekers we see Dennis Wilburn
              nodding, holding a thumbs up.  He tries to get to Maguire,
              but cannot.  And then a commotion behind them all.
 
                                  REPORTER
                        It's Tidwell!
 
              Tidwell exits the locker room.  Press and media surround him.
              Even the grizzled old-time stadium workers reach in to
              squeeze him, to slap him, to touch him.  He works his way to
              Maguire.
 
              They hug. Cameras flash.  Tears roll down from beneath his
              purple shades.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        We did it.
 
              And now, in the middle of this emotional union, a portable
              phone rings.  Both men reach for their porties.  It's
              Maguire's.  With anticipation, he answers.


                                                                     127.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello.
                               (beat)
                        It's Marcee.  She says she
                        couldn't get through on your phone.
 
              Tidwell grabs the phone, and joyously shares the moment with
              his wife.  Jerry watches, as Tidwell leans on his shoulder.
 
              ON SUGAR AND SWENSON (WATCHING THEM)
 
              Bob Sugar watches from the nearby wall where he stands with

                                  SWENSON
                        Why don't we have that kind of
                        relationship?
 
              INT. ARIZONA KAROAKE BAR -- NIGHT
 
              Rod Tidwell sings karoake, on stage.  He's struggling through
              U2's "One."  In the audience are many Arizona players, as
              well as most of Tidwell's family.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        One love... you got to share it...

              INT. KAROAKE BAR -- NIGHT
 
              We move past many Big Men celebrating Tidwell, singing along,
              sharing their Monday Night victory, onto melancholy Jerry
              Maguire. He watches, cellular at his side, as a YOUNG AGENT
              approaches.
 
                                  YOUNG AGENT
                        Jerry Maguire.  I'm Tommy Bendis.
                        You don't know me, I'm a new
                        agent, just getting started.  I
                        represent that place kicker over
                        there.
                               (indicates kicker)
                        I wondered if you would sign this
                        for me. Because it inspired me.
 
              He withdraws a well-thumbed copy of Jerry's Mission
              Statement.  The blue cover is ripped along one edge.  It
              clearly has served as a manifesto for this younger man's
              career.


                                                                     128.
 
 
              ON JERRY MAGUIRE
 
              He feels the cover, flips through it a little.  Memories
              flood with the passing pages.   Shot holds on Jerry's face,
              as Tidwell continues singing in the background.  Suddenly, an
              odd feeling.  A shiver runs up and down his spine.  His
              forehead tingles.  He rubs his face.  All he can do is think
              of Dorothy.
 
                                  AGENT
                        Just make it out "To Tommy".
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tommy.  I love you.
 
              INT. AIRPORT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry Maquire sprints through the empty airport, heading for
              the last flight out of town.  Music.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              The Divorced Women's Group in session.  Laurel stands near
              the doorway, blowing cigarette smoke into the night.  Dorothy
              is now a part of this group.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I've listened to you all tell a
                        thousand sob stories, and I have
                        been very judgmental. Frankly, I
                        think you've all been waaaay too
                        comfortable with your pain.  Plus,
                        Jan, you always spill your red
                        wine on the couch.
                               (off Jan's guilty
                                look)
                        I've not been fair to you.  Women
                        need to stick together, and not
                        depend on the affections of a man
                        to "fix" their lives.  Maybe
                        you're all correct. Men are the
                        enemy.
 
              Murmurs of agreement.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        But I still love the enemy.
 
              Murmurs of disappointment.

              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry exits cab, holding hang-up bag.  Looks at the house.
              On the other side of that window is a world he hopes he's
              still a part of.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters.  Dorothy is seated toward the back.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello.  I'm looking for my wife.
 
              Dorothy looks up, robbed of words.  Stunned, she does not
              move.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Alright.  If this is where it has
                        to happen, then this is where it
                        has to happen.
 
              Dorothy says nothing.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I'm not letting you get rid of me.
                        How about that?
 
              He shares a look with some of the other women.  She's not
              going to say a word.  Neither do they.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        This used to be my specialty. I
                        was good in a living room.  Send
                        me in there, I'll do it alone. And
                        now I just... I don't know... but
                        on what was supposed to be the
                        happiest night of my business
                        life, it wasn't complete, wasn't
                        nearly close to being in the same
                        vicinity as complete, because I
                        couldn't share it with you.  I
                        couldn't hear your voice, or laugh
                        about it with you.  I missed my
                        wife.  We live in a cynical world,
                        and we work in a business of tough
                        competitors, so try not to laugh --
                               (directly)
                        I love you.  You complete me.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello.


                                                                     130.
 
 
              He moves to her.  They embrace.  Ray watches in b.g.  Jerry
              has given this room hope.  It's on their faces. At last, even
              Laurel gets off on her sister's happiness, as she shares a
              look with Chad.

                        No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.

                        -- well, Rod, your agent passed me
                        a note before the show. He says

                        slow, but they do come around.
                        I'm leaving somebody out...
 
              Amused and finally glimpsing the end of a long journey, Jerry
              leans over to Marcee.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Take care, Marcee.  We'll see you
                        at the restaurant.
 
              She nods, emotionally, biting her lip.

              Jerry watches wonderously at the monitor before leaving. TV
              credits are rolling on the show.

              EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY
 
              Jerry, Dorothy, Ray exit into the daylight.  They walk to
              Jerry's car. From across the fence, a stray baseball from a
              pick-up game flies into the parking lot and bounces ahead of
              them.  Ray picks it up. In an easy fluid motion, he whips it
              back over the fence to the game on the other side.  A few
              kids on the other side of the fence shout their approval of
              a great little throw.


                                                                     132.
 
 
              Jerry and Dorothy stop, looking at Ray who has just shown
              shocking natural ability.  They are quiet for a moment,
              turning slowly to look at each other.  And then, not ready to
              deal with it, not even close to ready to deal with it, they
              say quickly to the boy:
 
                           JERRY                         DOROTHY
                   Come on, Ray.                 Ray, let's go.
 
              Happily Ray joins them as they walk to the car.  A family.
              Music.

              He swats a pitch -- not out of the park, it's much sweeter
              than that.  He drills it over the first baseman's head, just
              out of reach of his glove. Art runs to first, laughing.  Pats

              A wall of new NFL merchandise.  Television monitors blink
              with the latest endorsement films. Into frame moves JERRY
              MAGUIRE, 35.  He walks briskly and smoothly, yellow legal
              tablet in hand, at home in this lobby filled with Athletes
              and Sports Team Owners.  We hear Herb Alpert's epic
              instrumental, "The Lonely Bull."

              The SMI agents are a fierce, happy bunch.  They sit in a
              carefully appointed conference room.
 
              Sports photos and posters are framed on the walls.  The signs
              of global marketing are omnipresent.  Each agent has a silver
              tray containing soft drinks and a glass pitcher of water.
              Through the glass window, we see a large office divided up
              into many cubicles.

              Near the end of the table sits Jerry Maguire.  The word

              INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE -- HOUSTON -- DAY
 
              An unmarked car pulls into the underground parking facility
              of the Houston Police Department.  A cluster of chattering
              media members move in on the car. ("Baja!!"  "Baja, over
              here!!")  Back doors open, and out steps Jerry Maguire with
              huge offensive lineman, BOBBY "BAJA" BRUNARD, 22.  He is
              angry, and he is handcuffed.

                        fired the shot in the 7/l1?
 
              Jerry whips in between Baja and the taunting media, blocking
              him off and forcing him through the glass doors into the
              police department.  Professional smile in place, Maguire
              attempts spin.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen, there's no proof of
                        anything except that this guy is
                        a sensational athlete.
 
              In the background, we hear baja bellowing insults at the
              press.
 
              INT. ATLANTA RED CARPET ROOM -- ANOTHER DAY
 
              Jerry now sits next to a towering white 27 year-old
              basketball player with a bad haircut. He is CALVIN NACK.
              They are signing a contract in the airport lounge. A little
              BOY approaches the player with a basketball trading card.
 
                                  LITTLE BOY
                        Are you Calvin Nack?  Could you
                        sign my card?

              Nack bends down with a kindly-looking face.

                        I'm sorry little fella.  I can't
                        sign that particular brand of

                        Blue Dot cards.
 
              The Little Boy looks confused. As Calvin Nack turns to grab
              an orange juice from a barmaid, Jerry smoothly dishes off a
              business card to the little boy.

                        Steve Remo. I play for the
                        Blackhawks.
                               (now on a roll)
                        You are my son.  This pretty lady
                        is my wife.  And you are...
 
              Jerry nods encouragingly, presents his best "familiar" face.
 
                                  STEVE REMO
                               (continuing)
                        My agent!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yes!
 
                                  STEVE REMO
                        And I gotta play this weekend,
                        Doc. If I play in 65% of the
                        games, I make my bonus.
 
              EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Remo's 14 year-old SON (JESSE) confronts Jerry outside the
              hospital room. He's a hulking kid, a Pop Warner football
              player himself. His voice is in the process of changing.


                                                                     6.
 
 
                                  SON
                        This is his fourth concussion.
                        Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?
 
              As he talks, Jerry's cellular phone rings in his bag.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (glib, easy)
                        Come on -- it'd take a tank to
                        stop your dad.  It would take all
                        five Super Trooper VR Warriors,
                        right?
 
              The kid stares at Maguire.  It feels as if the kid is peering
              into his soul... and all he sees is trash.
 
                                  SON
                        Fuck you.
 
              The kid turns and exits in disgust.  He leaves Jerry standing
              in the hallway.  Devastated. Music.
 
              EXT. RENTAL CAR SHUTTLE -- DAY
 
              Jerry Maguire upset in a rental shuttle.  Passing through
              frame. Music.  Phone still ringing.
 
              INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
 
              Jerry sleeps.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Two nights later in Miami at our
                        corporate conference, a
                        breakthrough. Breakdown?
                        Breakthrough.
 
              Jerry's eyes open.  Breathing strangely.  Trembling, he holds
              onto the nightstand for grounding.
 
              He gets up, takes a few gulps of air, walks to mini-bar.
              Gathers some tiny ice cubes in his hand, smears them across
              his face.  This feeling is new to him.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        It was the oddest, most unexpected
                        thing.  I began writing what they
                        call a Mission Statement for my
                        company. You know -- a Mission
                        Statement -- a suggestion for the
                        future.


                                                                     7.
 
 
              INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry types, a pot of coffee and tray of room service nearby.
              we watch his face, alive now.
 
              There is a direct line from the deepest part of him to the
              words he's typing.  His fingers fly.  Even his eyes grow
              moist.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        What started out as one page
                        became twenty-five. Suddenly I was
                        my father's son.  I was
                        remembering the simple pleasures
                        of this job, how I ended up here
                        out of law school, the way a
                        stadium sounds when one of my
                        players performs well on the
                        field... I was remembering even
                        the words of the late Dicky Fox,
                        the original sports agent, who
                        said:
 
              SHOT OF DICKY FOX
 
                                  DICKY FOX
                        The key to this job is personal
                        relationships.
 
              As Jerry continues typing, his voice is excited now.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        And suddenly it was all pretty
                        clear. The answer was fewer
                        clients.  Caring for them, caring
                        for ourselves, and the games too.
                        Starting our lives, really.
 
              SHOT OF SENTENCE:  We must embrace what is still virginal
              about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly
              clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we
              must simply be the best versions of ourselves... that
              goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear.
 
              He pauses, and wipes his eyes, still considering the sentence.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        Hey, I'll be the first to admit
                        it. What I was writing was
                        somewhat "touchy feely."
 
              He deletes it.  And then -- zip -- he restores it and
              continues on, boldly.


                                                                     8.
 
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                               (continuing)
                        I didn't care.  I had lost the
                        ability to bullshit.  It was the
                        me I'd always wanted to be.
 
              INT. KINKO'S COPIES -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in T-shirt stands proudly watching copies pumped out.
              Wired college students, band guys, other Copy People of the
              Night nearby.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        I printed it up in the middle of
                        the night, before I could re-think
                        it.
 
              Industrial, multi-pierced Kinko's copy guy examines the first
              printed copy of the Mission Statement.  He nods approvingly,
              taps his heart in tribute.  He slides a copy across the
              counter, for Jerry's approval.
 
                          THE THINGS WE THINK AND DO NOT SAY
                            (The Future of Our Business)
 
                                  KINKO'S GUY
                        That's how you become great, man.
                        You hang your ba11s out there.
 
              Jerry nods.  It's 3 AM, and this guy sounds and looks like a
              prophet.  In fact, everyone in Kinko's at 3 AM does.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (self-effacing)
                        Thanks.
 
              ON MEMOS
 
              being stuffed into mail-slots.
 
              INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING
 
              Jerry splashes water onto his face.  The sun is coming up.
              He looks younger, lighter.
 
              ON TV MOVIE  (JERRY WATCHING)
 
              Suddenly, dramatic movie score.  It's Dana Andrews, showing
              Gene Tierney the newspaper reports of her death in Laura.
              ("Someone was murdered in this room last night... any idea
              who it was?")  Camera whips to Jerry, standing watching as he
              packs.  A slight concern on his face.  He moves to the phone,
              and dials with urgency.


                                                                     9.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi, it's jerry maguire.  Uh,
                        listen did those manuscripts
                        get... Oh they did... No no no no
                        no, that's fine...
 
              INT. ELEVATOR -- DAY
 
                                  JERRY
                        Jerry in suit, alone with his
                        luggage.  Dry throat. clammy,
                        holds onto the handrail to steady
                        himself.
 
              INT. LOBBY -- DAY
 
              The lobby is filled with SMI agents.  The blue Mission
              Statement is in evidence everywhere.  Jerry inconspicuously
              turns the corner, yearns to blend in.  It's impossible, the
              recognition ripples through the lobby.  Underling agent BOB
              SUGAR, 25, is the first to grab Maguire by the shoulders.
              ("Finally, someone said it!") Suddenly another agent begins
              to clap, then reluctantly, another. Soon, the ovation rocks
              the lobby.  (In a three-shot near the front desk, we see a 26
              year-old female employee of SMI applauding with Mission
              Statement in hand, her sleepy son at her side.)  Jerry
              motions for them all to stop, but clearly he could listen
              forever. It is a watershed moment in his life.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        I was 35.  I had started my life.
 
              Swing off Maguire to find two agents standing clapping
              enthusiastically near the elevator. One offers gum to the
              other.
 
                                  AGENT # 1 (RACHEL)
                        How long you give him?
 
                                  AGENT # 2 (CHRIS)
                        Mmmm.  A week.

              folding up into a plane, as music and credits end.
 
              INT. AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS -- NIGHT
 
              We move past a snoring businessman, onto tired but
              adrenalized Jerry Maguire.  He sits in first-class, working
              on his laptop, a pile of newspapers and magazines nearby.
              The WOMAN PASSENGER next to him, 3oish, finishes up a spicy
              phone conversation with her boyfriend.


                                                                     10.
 
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Monkeyface... monkeyface,
                        listen... I'm not going to say it
                        here.... no...
 
              Jerry continues to work, as his laptop now beeps.  Battery's
              low.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (continuing)
                        ...  oh listen, I got you the
                        perfect white shirt, at this out
                        of the way place... no... quit
                        trying to make me say it!
 
              Jerry shuts off his laptop and prepares for sleep.  Trying
              not to listen.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (continuing)
                        how about if I do it and don't say
                        it... mmmm... see you soon...
 
              She laughs seductively and hangs up.  She is still buzzed
              from the conversation.  Jerry turns to her, surprising her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I have to ask.
 
                                  WOMAN
                               (protective)
                        What --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Where'd you find the perfect white
                        shirt?
 
              She laughs, it's an infectious laugh -- two strangers
              enjoying the good life -- as we DRIFT BACK three rows, past
              the panel separating the cool comfort of first class from the
              stuffy airless and uncomfortable world of coach.
 
              We meet DOROTHY BOYD, 26.  A harried passenger on this bus in
              the sky.  Her clothes are part-contemporary, part mother-
              functional. She is never as composed or in control as she
              wants to be. Right now she is devoted to the sneezing kid in
              the wrinkled white-shirt sitting next to her.  It is RAY, her
              five-year old son.  Dorothy is covered in toys and books.
              Stuffed into the side pocket is Jerry's Mission Statement.
              The easy laughter from three rows ahead washes over her like
              cold water, as she rings again for a Flight Attendant.  The
              overworked ATTENDANT arrives, pissed, snapping off the bell.


                                                                     11.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Look, my son is allergic to the
                        material in these blankets -
 
                                  ATTENDANT
                        That's all we have.
 
              The Attendant offers a bundle of soggy cocktail napkins and
              is about to exit as Ray makes a gagging noise.  He's about to
              get sick. Both women reach for an airsick bag, and get it to
              his mouth just in time. Their faces are now inches apart.
 
                                  ATTENDANT
                               (continuing)
                        I'm sorry I was rude just then --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's okay.  We're in it together
                        now...
 
              The Attendant now exits helpfully with the bag.
 
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Don't take anything I say
                        seriously! I love to flirt!
 
              Dorothy, irritated, leans out into the aisle to look for the
              heads that belong to these voices.
 
              BACK TO JERRY AND WOMAN

                        You're with the sports people on
                        the plane, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing
                        the Coke commercials for the
                        playoffs.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well.  Good luck with that --
 
              He nods, as he reaches up to shut off the light.  Politely
              stifles another yawn.  He shuts his eyes, settles into sleep.
              Bobbi leans into his darkness.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Can I just get a quick "man's"
                        opinion from you on something?
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


                                                                     12.
 
 
              INT.  FIRST CLASS SEATS -- LATER
 
              Bobbi is intense now, unburdening, as tired Jerry listens
              like a priest.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        And I can't say his name without
                        laughing I want to eat him up. I
                        want to say goodbye to every bad
                        thought I ever had about
                        relationships.  I mean, I crave
                        this guy... and yet... why... why
                        did I have that affair this
                        weekend?  Does that mean I'm not
                        in love with my boyfriend?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think you'll know when you see
                        him at the gate.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        It's the death rattle of my
                        singlehood, right? Because I
                        finally see the white picket fence
                        looming and I love it/hate it/love
                        it/hate it/ love it... you're
                        right, I'll know when I see him.
                        Why is it so easy to talk with
                        you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
 
              Maguire fights another yawn.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I uh... don't think we're quite at
                        your pitch yet.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Tell me, and then you can sleep.
 
                                  JERRY
                        She's an NFL publicist... amazing
                        sense of style... former
                        athlete... volleyball... world
                        class... really knows how to live
                        every moment of her life, which is
                        why I should take a nap now...
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              Her sleeping son now silent, she can't help but listen.
 
                                  WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Tell me how you proposed.  I
                        collect romantic proposal stories.


                                                                     13.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no...
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (impatient)
                        Oh, tell the story.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh, tell the story.
 
              BACK TO JERRY -- LATER
 
                                  JERRY
                        --so our first date, she told me
                        about her favorite place in the
                        world, the seven pools of Hana on
                        the island of Maui...
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Gorgeous.
 
                                  JERRY
                        A year-and-a-half later, we were
                        both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl.
                        Now I've always hit a wall at 18
                        months.  Every serious girlfriend
                        lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka-
                        boom.  The curse of 18 months.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        That's when you need to cement,
                        and define define define.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Exactly.  And the world does not
                        need another 35 year-old bachelor.
                        I knew I wanted to propose, so I
                        took her there.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        To the pools?
 
                                  JERRY
                        To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock
                        Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock
                        Climber, but we're hiking up
                        through the pools and there's a
                        fine mist in the air, and I have
                        the ring in my pocket, and I'm a
                        little nervous, I'm lagging
                        behind, and she says to me, get
                        this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh no --


                                                                     14.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, it bothered me somewhat.
                        And I got quiet.  And now she's
                        quiet and we're both pouting a
                        little, you know.  And I decide
                        I'm not going to propose.  The
                        mood is not right. Why be
                        impulsive? Now at this point I
                        know she knows that I was going to
                        propose and didn't.  And she knows
                        I know.  So the entire sixty mile
                        ride back to the airport, we don't
                        speak. And we're both good at
                        that.  We fly to Honolulu in
                        silence.  We check into the Pro
                        Bowl hotel --
 
                                  WOMAN
                        How sad --
 
                                  JERRY
                        But wait...
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              She is now craning out into the aisle to hear this story.
              The plane is now quieter.  She listens to the easy sound of
              Jerry discussing his charmed life.
 
                                  RAY
                               (waking up)
                        Mama --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Shhh.  Mommy's eavesdropping.
 
              He sneezes, three big ones in a row.  She hands him more
              kleenex, riveted on the story.  And listens.
 
                                  JERRY'S VOICE
                        Now little do I know that my
                        assistant. has assumed that I've
                        now proposed. So she has gotten
                        the lounge band to actually play
                        "Here Comes The Bride" when we
                        walk back in.
 
              Dorothy laughs to herself, somewhat derisively.  She tries to
              share the laugh with her son, who stares at her.


                                                                     15.
 
 
              BACK TO JERRY -- LATER
 
                                  JERRY
                        Which they do.  And we're standing
                        there. All the football guys are
                        in the lobby, watching, there's
                        even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to
                        her and sort of grandly say,
                        "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking
                        you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to
                        marry me." And I took out the
                        ring, and I don't much like big
                        scenes, but she said "yes" right
                        there in the lobby and some of the
                        toughest men in football wept like
                        babies.  We're getting married in
                        February.
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Jerry.  You two will be together
                        forever.
 
              BACK TO DOROTHY
 
              She takes one of her son's kleenex sheets, as an elegant
              Flight Attendant shuts the curtain to first class. Dorothy
              blows her nose, moved against her will.
 
                                  RAY
                        What's wrong, mom?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        First class is what's wrong.  It
                        used to be a better meal.  Now
                        it's a better life.
 
              She pulls out the Mission Statement,  aware that she's been
              listening to its author.  She opens it and begins to read.
 
              INT. LAX AIRPORT TERMINAL -- MORNING
 
              Jerry Maguire exits the plane a few steps behind Bobbi Fallon.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (quietly, like a
                                coach)
                        You'll know when you see him.
                        You'll know when you see him.
 
              Bobbi scans the crowd. She spots Monkeyface, large and burly
              in tiger-print sweats.  He looks like Mickey Dolenz.  He
              holds flowers.


                                                                     16.
 
 
                                  WOMAN
                        Oh my God, you're right.  I know.
                               (Jerry smiles)
                        He's not The One.  He's not the
                        One.
 
              Jerry's face falls.  Bobbi Fallon moves into the embrace,
              faking it.  Jerry moves ahead, turning back to see the doomed
              couple. Melancholy now, he continues forward through the
              crowded airport and the expectant faces of those waiting for
              loved ones.  Music.
 
              INT. LUGGAGE AREA -- MORNING
 
              Dorothy looks through the rubber flaps of the luggage
              conveyor belt.  She clutches a cup of coffee.  In the
              background, other SMI agents' grab their bags and exit.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Ray! Ray!
 
              Maguire enters picture, joining her as she looks into the
              dark depths behind the flaps.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Can I help?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office.
                        I was on the junket to the
                        conference. I'm --
 
                                  JERRY
                        I know who y6u are.  You're
                        Dorothy Boyd.  You're in...
                        wait... you're in Accounts.  You
                        have the middle cubicle toward the
                        back with that poster of Albert
                        Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0
                        Neal's body.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (surprised)
                        Hmm.  Pretty good.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now what did you lose?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        My son... my mind...
 
              Over her shoulder, Maguire sees Ray rounding the corner,
              riding the luggage conveyor belt like Washington crossing the
              Delaware.


                                                                     17.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, while I go look for him, why
                        don't you hang onto this curious
                        gentleman behind you --
 
              Dorothy turns, is greatly relieved to see Ray, and snatches
              him off the belt.  She bends down into his face.  She speaks
              softly but intensely, with no frills.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Remember "imagination?"...
                        remember what that means?  Well,
                        this is one of my bosses so you
                        will now IMAGINE me screaming at
                        you right now. Do NOT do that
                        again.  Ever ever EVER.
 
              She rises, shifting back to being a somewhat relaxed young
              woman of 26.  It's a transition she makes, oh, 500 times a
              day.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Well, thanks.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, take care.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        And have fun at your bachelor
                        party.
 
              Jerry pauses just a moment, but it's long enough.  Dorothy
              freezes.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Oh no.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no. I knew.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (slow sigh)
                        Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm just... anxiously looking
                        past it.  I already had my
                        bachelor party.  It was called "my
                        twenties." See you later.
 
              Jerry takes off.


                                                                     18.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I loved your memo, by the way.
 
              He stops.  Turns.  She flashes the well-thumbed copy in her
              purse. Jerry takes a step closer, interested and flattered.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks... actually, it was just a
                        "Mission Statement."
 
              Ray has taken Jerry's free hand, and begun swinging on him.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I think in this age, optimism like
                        that... it's a revolutionary act.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (eager for feedback)
                        You think so?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh tsht. Yes.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I appreciate that, because some of
                        that stuff... you know, it was two
                        in the morning and...
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        -- the part about "we should
                        embrace what it is still virginal
                        about our enthusiasm" --
 
              Jerry looks slightly edgy at the naked vulnerability of his
              words.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        -- "and we should all force open
                        the tightly-clenched fist of
                        commerce, and give a little back
                        for the greater good.". I mean, I
                        was inspired, and I'm an
                        accountant.  Ray, don't spill my
                        coffee.
 
              Jerry looks more nervous, as Ray has now taken his mother's
              hand. He is now swinging on both of them.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two-three... swing.


                                                                     19.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey.  To respect yourself enough
                        to say it out loud, to put
                        yourself out there, so openly...
                               (shakes her head)
                        ... I don't know, it got me.
 
              Now Jerry looks concerned, as Ray continues swinging happily.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two-three, swing.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks.  May I offer you both a
                        ride?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh no.  I'm sure it would just
                        make your day to drive us all the
                        way to Manhattan Beach, taking
                        that left down to little tiny
                        Waterloo street where you have to
                        play chicken with oncoming
                        traffic, and your life flashes
                        before your eyes, but -- hey, I've
                        obviously had too much coffee and
                        all -- here's my sister Laurel to
                        pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (amused)
                        Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
 
                                  RAY
                        One-two...
 
              Jerry lets Ray down easy.  The kid is a little disappointed.
              But Maguire bows, always courtly, and exits to get his bag.
              He then realizes something amiss and returns quickly, pulling
              Ray's hand up again and completing the swing.
 
                                  JERRY
                        ... three, swing.
 
              Ray is now happy, in love even, as Jerry exits.  Dorothy
              laughs, as her sister arrives. LAUREL BOYD is 36. No make-up,
              no bullshit. Laurel has a pin on her sweater, which catches
              on dorothy's shirt as they hug.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Come on, I'm double-parked.
 
              Dorothy returns to the world of motherhood, bending down,
              gathering Ray's toys.  She wipes at Ray's hair.


                                                                     20.
 
 
              ("Don't put food in your hair.")   She is surprised that
              she's a little jazzed from her encounter with Jerry Maguire.
              She can't help but look back at Jerry, who catches her
              looking.   He salutes her, with mock circumstance.  She
              returns it with a guilty smile.  He disappears, and she finds
              herself oddly short of breath.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (to herself)
                        Hmmph.  Whoever snagged him must
                        be some classy babe --
 
              INT. AVERY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              AVERY BISHOR, 29, makes love to Jerry Maguire at fever pitch.
              They are standing on the bed, which is in the corner.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't ever stop fucking me!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sooner... or later... I'll have to
                        stop.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been
                        better. Never BETTER!!
 
              Nearby, a large and sleepy German Shepard yawns.
 
                                  AVERY
                               (continuing)
                        Never BETTER!!
 
              The dog snaps awake, a little shook.  Avery suddenly yanks
              away. Breathing hard, she just looks at Jerry. Sex is a very
              serious business with Avery.
 
                                  AVERY
                               (continuing)
                        Open your eyes.
                               (he does)
                        If you ever want me to be with
                        another woman for you, I would do
                        it.  I'm not interested in it.
                        There was a time, yes, it felt
                        normal for me, but it was a phase,
                        a college thing, like torn Levi's
                        or law school for you... people
                        change, but if you ever feel like
                        being adventurous in that way, I
                        would do it for you.  You want
                        anything from the kitchen I'm
                        going to get some fruit --


                                                                     21.
 
 
              She skips off like a colt.  Jerry digests what he's just been
              told.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (to the next room)
                        You know.  I don't think we need
                        to do the thing where we tell each
                        other everything!
 
                                  AVERY (O.S.)
                               (laughing)
                        Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
 
              Jerry rubs his face, as he does often when processing complex
              information.
 
                                  AVERY (0.5.)
                        Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we
                        have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
 
                                  JERRY (0.5.)
                        I know about the bachelor party.
 
              Avery returns.  Her robo body, half-lit now in the hallway,
              is a glorious life-long project.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Who told you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        One of the accountants.
 
              She makes a pissed-off sound.  She then walks over, taking
              his shoulders and bending them forward.  She is an expert at
              body manipulation, loosening him as she talks.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry.  Your buddy Dooler worked
                        his ass off to make you a tribute
                        film. All those guys from the
                        office are coming.  Everybody
                        loves you.  Just calm down, relax,
                        act surprised, and have an amazing
                        time.  And you'll never guess who
                        narrates your bachelor movie.
 
              INT. FANCY HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters the hotel suite and over-acts surprise.  He
              falls down, clutching his heart, feigning an attack. He looks
              around for a bigger reaction than he actually gets.
 
              THE FILM -- SHOWN ON BIG-SCREEN T.V.
 
              It is hosted by MICHAEL JORDAN.


                                                                     22.
 
 
                                  MICHAEL JORDAN
                        I have often wondered where my
                        career would have been had Jerry
                        Maguire been my agent.  The
                        answer -- Yugoslavia.
 
              Tepid laughs, as many of the agents turn and grab furtive
              looks at Maguire, who stands at the back of the room with his
              friend BILL DOOLER.  Dooler, husky, 30, looks like a beatnik
              on steroids.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        You hear those courtesy laughs,
                        Jerry? There is a seething
                        wrongness at the edges of this
                        party.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh come on --
 
                                  DOOLER
                        This is fuckin Michael Jordan,
                        man! They should be screaming.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (eying crowd)
                        You're imagining it.
 
              They are joined by unctuous agent Bob Sugar.  Sugar is a
              Maguire wannabee.  Puts an arm on Jerry's shoulder.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        We still having lunch tomorrow,
                        Jerry?  Looks like Carl Denton
                        tested positive for marijuana.
                        That moves Cush solidly up to
                        numero uno in the draft.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Oh, that'll really help this
                        party! Let's all talk business!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (smoothly)
                        The best commercial director in
                        the business.  I hail you.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Sorry I yelled.  You have
                        exquisite taste.


                                                                     23.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Everybody's having a great time.
                        You're both nuts -- the movie's
                        great.
 
              Sugar moves on, cheerfully.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        I like that guy.
 
              (The movie, which plays simultaneously with the conversation,
              is a Hi-8 confessional of Jerry's former girlfriends.
              MICHAEL JORDAN is cut into this, nodding, as if he were
              actually interviewing.  The effect is funny, but the
              confessions are brutally honest.  There is The One He Was Too
              Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For ("He hated being
              alone.") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock
              girlfriend ("Sports makes me ill"), The Now Married With Kids
              Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend ("Beneath the cute
              exterior, more cute exterior.") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend,
              The Brainy Girlfriend, ("Great at friendship, bad at
              intimacy") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry
              Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his-
              way-to-the-airport).  All seem to agree on some basic points
              (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following
              information to underscore it.)  Jerry always has a
              girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up
              with the last one.  The relationship always competes with his
              job, and the job always wins.  The final confrontation
              happens somewhere around the 18-month mark. Sequence ends
              with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to
              burn all these old phone numbers.)
 
                                  JERRY
                               (wounded good sport)
                        ... this is... uh... too funny...
 
                                  DOOLER
                        They ain't laughing, man.
                        Something's wrong.
 
              Jerry nods, takes a swig of beer.  He knows the response is
              little more than polite.  None of the other agents can keep
              eye contact with him.  Dooler is right.  On the screen, the
              finale features a good-humored collage of Jerry photos, cut
              to music.
 
              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Elevator doors open.  Maguire is now paranoid.  He walks
              through the buzzing SMI headquarters, heading for his corner
              office.  He is like an FBI man searching treetops and corners
              for the Gunman. Everywhere he looks is a potential Grassy
              Knoll.


                                                                     24.
 
 
              He passes Fellow Agents, always smiling, giving a word of
              encouragement to an Agent having an emotional hallway
              conversation with an Athlete, even bends down to check the
              sheet of slides being approved by a very large but seated
              Basketball Player. Moving forward. There is trouble in the
              air, but only he seems to sense it.  He turns corner and is
              met by assistant WENDY, who hands him a long list of calls.
              The sheet flaps against his leg as she moves with him toward
              his back office.
 
                                  WENDY
                               (as in 'get ready')
                        Marcee's here.  She's already in
                        your office.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks, Wendy.
 
              INT. JERRY MAGUIRE'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Jerry enters his corner office overlooking both the shiny
              waters of Newport Beach and a large mall parking lot. Already
              standing, reading the mail on his desk is lively MARCEE
              TIDWELL, 25. African-American, gorgeous, a heat-seeking
              smartbomb.  She is also five months pregnant.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee.  How's my favorite
                        player's wife?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Jerry, Rod is very very upset.
                        Tyson, no!
 
              Across the room, 4 year-old menace TYSON ceases trying to pry
              a plexiglass case off the wall.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tyson, hello.
 
              Tyson just stares at Jerry.  Jerry has little luck with kids.
              He gives Marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge.  He
              grabs a two-pint bottle of orange Gatorade -- another
              habit -- and sits down at his desk.  He slips into crisis
              mode like an old shirt.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        How can I make your life better?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I know you say to take the Arizona
                        offer, but my husband needs more
                        recognition.
                                  (more)


                                                                     25.
 
 
                                  MARCEE (cont'd)
                        He is the biggest, fastest,
                        raddest wide-receiver in the
                        league.  Now I don't know what you
                        do for your four-percent
 
              --The door opens, Bob Sugar pokes his head in.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Cronin's okay for lunch?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Marcee -- this is one of our
                        agents. This is Bob Sugar, who
                        needs to learn to knock.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Pleasure.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        You've called our house, right?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Sorry to interrupt you guys.
 
              Sugar exits.  Marcee resumes at the exact point, at the exact
              level of intensity.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Now I don't know what you do for
                        your five-percent, but this man,
                        my husband has a whole plan, an
                        image... we majored in marketing,
                        Jerry, and when you put him in a
                        Waterbed Warehouse commercial,
                        excuse me, you are making him
                        common.  He is pure gold and
                        you're giving him "Waterbed
                        Warehouse" when he deserves the
                        big four -- shoe, car, clothing-
                        line, soft-drink.  The four jewels
                        of the celebrity endorsement
                        dollar.
 
              Jerry finds himself admiring her drive, and she commands the
              best in him.  The desk buzzes, and Jerry ignores it.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        You gonna get that --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Not a chance.
 
              She smiles.

                                                                     26.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Marcee, things are changing around
                        here.  You and Rod will have my
                        total personal attention.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (upping the ante)
                        Damn right, and you can start by
                        taking Rod's poster and putting it
                        where people can see it!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it's infectious)
                        Damn right.
 
              He climbs up on the edge of his sofa, and reaches for the
              poster with his hanging device. True to Marcee's complaint,
              the poster hangs in the upper Siberian region of his wall.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Look at that handsome man, trying
                        to build a life up there by the
                        air-conditioner. We're coming to
                        get ya, darlin!  We are so close
                        to having it all!
 
              ON THE POSTER -- CLOSE
 
              It is the kind of poster that is strictly the domain of
              second-tier players. Commanding wide-receiver ROD TIDWELL,
              27, stands shirtless, hands on hips, looking vaguelyl
              uncomfortable. Emplazoned above his head: IN ROD WE TRUST.
              Elsewhere in the room, we hear the inevitable crash
              ("Tyson!").
 
              EXT. CRONIN'S GRILL -- AFTERNOON
 
              Crowded outdoor restaurant in the business district. Jerry
              sits down opposite Bob Sugar, still making a few notes.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Gimme a second here... Tidwell...
                        Arizona contract... new glass
                        cabinet...
 
                                  SUGAR
                        You okay?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (looking up)
                        I'm fine.  What's up?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I came here to let you go.


                                                                     27.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Pardon me?
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Came here to fire you, Jerry.
 
              For a long moment there is only silence.  They study each
              other. These are two smart boys, each one anticipating the
              other's next three or four moves.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        It's real, Jerry.  You... you
                        should say something.
 
              Suddenly he's flushed, a little embarrassed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw shit...the crowded
                        restaurant... so there's no
                        scene...
 
                                  SUGAR
                        I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
 
              In a back room, the waiters are singing the restaurant's
              "Birthday Song" to someone else. Jerry is dying.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You...
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (razor sharp)
                        You did this to yourself.  You
                        said "fewer clients."  You put it
                        all on paper.  Scully was very
                        upset.  Heart attacks make some
                        people sweeter, but not him.  You
                        did this to yourself --
 
              Jerry's mouth opens to finish his sentence, but before he can
              speak, Sugar continues.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        -- although I do gotta hand it to
                        you.  For about five minutes you
                        had everyone applauding smaller
                        revenues.
 
              Quietly, Maguire finishes the sentence he started earlier.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You... ungrateful... unctuous...


                                                                     28.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (unctuous)
                        ... dick?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dick.
 
              Maguire reaches for water.  The sound of the ice cubes
              jangling is suddenly very loud to him. He is drowning.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Give me a little credit for doing
                        this face-to-face!  What I went
                        through knowing I was going to do
                        this to my mentor!  Can you get
                        past yourself for a second?
 
                                  JERRY
                        You'll lose.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (musically)

                               (patronizing)
                        You'll always be my hero, Jerry.
                        Always always always.  We're
                        bringing other elements in, we're
                        focusing on endorsements -- it's
                        not about handholding anymore.
                        We're no longer babysitters --
 
              Jerry fights the desire to use his fists.  Hangs onto the
              table. He's starting to freak out now. Trying to calm down.
              Sugar's mouth keeps moving, but we hear the music in Jerry's
              mind.  Rising percussive music.
 
              EXT. STREET -- DAY
 
              Jerry tries to move briskly down the street, through the
              lunchtime businessmen traffic. Back to the office.


                                                                     29.
 
 
              INT. CRONIN'S -- DAY
 
              Sugar dines alone now.  Casually whips out a portable phone.
 
              INT. SMI ELEVATOR -- DAY
 
              Jerry in the elevator, eyes wide, mind racing.  Dorothy Boyd
              sees him, raises a hand to say hello.  Decides this is not a
              good time.
 
              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Close on Maguire as he moves through the office, heading to
              the back office.  Music
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire rolls the fax machine over to his desk.  He takes a
              breath, and begins to go to work. From within his bottom
              drawer, he withdraws a Powerbook.  Then from another drawer,
              a phone book. And then from his inner jacket pocket, a third
              smaller phone book. They are lined in front of him now, as he
              dials.
 
              INT. CUSHMAN HOME/ODESSA -- DAY
 
              Frank "Cush" Cushman picks up the phone.  Today, the young
              football God wears a yellow scarf on his head. He's still
              playing NBA Jam on his Gameboy' as he talks.
 
              EXT. CRONIN'S -- DAY
 
              Sugar at the table.  Chameleon-like, he adopts the
              personality of whomever he talks to.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Cush.  Hey Dudeboy!  It's Bob
                        Sugar. Listen, I'm callin' ya
                        first 'cause you're the most
                        important guy in sports...
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire on the telephone, fighting hard, as he feeds a fax
              into the machine at the same time.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Carla, right now you're paying 25%
                        of your endorsments to SMI, I
                        would cut my commission by 7%...
 
              As he talks, he takes a stack of his Mission Statements, once
              proudly set on his desk, and sentences them to the bottom
              drawer.


                                                                     30.
 
 
              EXT. STREET -- DAY
 
              Sugar strolls back to the office, talking on the portable.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        You read that memo I snuck to you,
                        the guy's tired of the job.  Tired
                        of making you money.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Maguire feeds a fax, types another fax on his Powerbook, all
              while he talks quickly on the phone.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And when I got you that big
                        contract in Chicago, and the fan
                        poll in the Sun-Times was 93%

              Several other agents working the cause behind Sugar, who
              breezes through the calls.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        He's costing you money, Debra...
                        he's oldschool.

              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Dorothy walks the center hallway with some contracts.  To the
              right and left of her are the phones are ringing.


                                                                     31.
 
 
              Something is amiss. She stops at the desk of fellow Accounts
              Exec CLEO, 32.

                               (no big deal)
                        They fired Jerry Maguire.  Did it
                        at Cronin's.
 
              Dorothy groans softly, as she lowers herself into her seat.
              She is strangely affected by the news. She scoots back on her
              roller chair, and looks down the hallway to Maguire's office
              door.

              KATHY SANDERS, 22 year-old figure skater, sits on a couch.
              Nearby are cardboard stand-ups, souvenirs of past
              endorsements. Also, the famous gold-medal shot from the
              Olympics. Kathy's adoring Mom and Dad sit next to her,
              listening in on the extension.  The Mission Statement is
              folded open on Dad's lap.  Kathy chokes on every other word,
              such is her anguish.

                        I already heard from Bob Sugar.
                        Jerry I want to cry for what they
                        did to you at SMI.  You helped me

              There is a click on the line.  She is pained and outraged.

              ROD TIDWELL, 27, begins this conversation in the kitchen.  He
              is a powerful physical presence, and he holds a hot new
              cellular phone. He fixes young son Tyson a bowl of cereal as
              he talks.  In the background, monitoring the crisis is Marcee

              Sugar works off a wristwatch.  He spends no longer than three
              minutes on each call.

              He covers the phone, as another agent hands him a cellular
              with another call on it.

                                  TIDWELL
                        Exactly.  And I'm sitting here
                        with an ant problem, look!  And my
                        brother Tee Pee's room is flooded
                        with water.  Say hello to Jerry
                        Maguire --
 
              We meet the messy-haired and slightly overweight brother of
              Tidwell, TEE PEE, 24.  Tee Pee, who lives free of charge in
              Rod's house, is a nakedly jealous and more political version
              of his brother.  He says into the phone:
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        Hello Jerry Maguire.


                                                                     35.
 
 
              Tidwell takes the phone back, and continues through the
              house, with Tee Pee now following the procession of family
              monitoring the important call.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        --  the house is fallin' apart, we
                        don't even know where we're gonna
                        live in a year, and I'm supposed
                        to be a "superstar," man!  Are you
                        catching my flow, here?
 
              Jerry looks at his watch.  Doomed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I need a decision from you, Rod.
 
              INT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Sugar has three phones going.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Killer, Steve, good decision.
                               (next call)
                        So it's yes, right?  Excellente.
                               (next call)
                        Tell me it's yes... yes?  YES!
 
              Tidwell enters bedroom.  Marcee, Tyson and Tee Pee in tow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        --  now to recap, I want to stay
                        in Arizona, I want my new
                        contract, I like you, you're nice
                        to my wife, I will stay with you,
                        that's what I'm doing for you, but
                        here's what you're gonna do for
                        me. You listening?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (dying)
                        Mmm.  Hmm.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        It's a very personal, very
                        important thing.  It's a family
                        motto.  So I want to share it with
                        you.  You ready?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yes.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Here it is.  "Show me the money."
                               (pause)
                        Show.  Me.  The.  Money.


                                                                     36.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I got it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Now doesn't that just make you
                        feel good to say it?  Say it with
                        me.
 
              The lights have gone down in the city, and he hasn't had a
              chance to turn his own light on.  He sits in the oncoming
              darkness, watching the blinking white lights on the phone
              bank on the desk.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Congratulations.  You're still my
                        agent.
 
              Tidwell hangs up.  Feeling good about the decision, he enters
              his closet and adds today's shoes to an enormous shoe
              collection. Nearby, Tee Pee shakes his head.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        An African-American man running
                        with a little ball, working for
                        white owners and white agents.
                        It's the iconography of rascism...
                               (off Tidwell's
                                dismissive look)
                        ... but I woulda stayed at the
                        bigger company.
 
              INT. SUGAR'S OFFICE -- DAY
 
              Sugar crosses the last call off his sheet, and throws himself
              on the sofa.  He lands in reclining mode with a soft pooof.
              The younger turks watch their new leader.  Victory is his.
 
              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry stands at the door, holding some belongings.  He looks
              back and symbolically flips the light switch off.
              Unfortunately he hasn't realized the lights are already off.
              So, in his final gesture, surprising himself, he has weirdly
              turned the lights on.
 
              EXT. CORNER OFFICE -- NIGHT
 
              Bam.  Jerry's door opens.  He exits his office with box.  He
              is now in a state of advancing melancholy, slightly unhinged.
              Many of the other agents now try not to watch him leaving.


                                                                     37.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, don't worry!  I'm not going
                        to do what you think I'm going to
                        do, which is FLIP OUT!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
 
              Jerry goes to a water dispenser, calming himself, and fills
              a small Dixie cup.  Downs it and fills it again, rubbing his
              face..
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        But let me just say, as I ease out
                        of the office I helped build --
                        sorry, but it's a fact --
 
              ON DOROTHY -- WATCHING
 
              from her cubicle.
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- that there is such a thing as
                        manners.  A way of treating
                        people...
 
              He notices the fish tank nearby. He attemps to be profound.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        These fish have manners!  They
                        have manners.
 
              And now Jerry feels bravado, mixed with a wave of anger.
              Another cup of water as he finds power.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        In fact.  They're coming with me!
                        I'm starting a new company, and
                        the fish will come with me and...
                        you can call me sentimental.
 
              He begins dipping into the tank, grabbing the one exotic fish
              that failed to escape his cup. It's a fire-tailed Peruvian
              beauty.  He grabs a baggie from an assistant's desk, shakes
              out some crumbs, and dumps the fish inside.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing; to fish)
                        it's okay... it's okay...
 
              Nearby, a Xerox Repair Guy watches the human train wreck.


                                                                     38.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        But if anybody else wants to come
                        with me, this moment will be the
                        ground floor of something real and
                        fun and inspiring and true in this
                        godforsaken business and we will
                        do it together!  Who's coming with
                        me besides... "Flipper" here?
 
              But clearly even Flipper is not happy with the new
              arrangement. Panicked, he whips around the small baggie.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Anybody going with me?
 
              Silence, someone coughs, as agents and office personnel look
              on with equal parts pity and embarrassment. Jerry downs
              another small cup of water. His lid is blowing off with each
              second.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Wendy?  Shall we?
 
              Assistant Wendy looks at Maguire.  Painfully polite:
 
                                  WENDY
                        I'm three months away from the pay
                        increase, Jerry.  I have to, uh...
                        you know, stay.
 
              Jerry absorbs the blow, and takes the keys from the top of
              her desk.  She can't look at him.  Jerry stands alone, the
              blue Mission Statement on Wendy's desk sits accusingly in
              frame.  There is only silence now, the loudest kind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, anybody else?
 
              ON DOROTHY
 
              She looks around.  Doesn't anybody believe in the very thing
              they were applauding three days ago?  She has an odd
              reaction, a muscle twitch of the soul.   Before she knows it,
              she stands boldly, unfortunately knocking a cup of coffee
              onto herself in the process.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'll go with you.
                               (quietly, on her
                                coffee mess)
                        Wonderful...


                                                                     39.
 
 
              She dabs at her pants.  Next to her, Cleo looks on sadly.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              halfway across the office.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dorothy Boyd!  Thank you!
 
              She gathers her things, increasingly aware of what she's done.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        We will see you all again.  Sleep
                        tight!
 
              He walks to Dorothy, and together they exit down the hallway
              corridor, past the framed posters and awards.
 
              WIDE-SHOT
 
              rising over the huge office.  For the first time, we see the
              full expanse of the huge SMI headquarters.  And down in the
              corner of the frame, two small figures leave carrying boxes.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (to Dorothy)
                        Let's see how they do without us.
 
              A beat of silence, then noise returns to its normal
              commercial roar.  A couple of fleas have been swatted off the
              carcass of an immense beast.
 
              INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT
 
              The tragic-sounding beep of the elevator passing floors.
              Jerry Maguire stands with Dorothy, both still charged with
              adrenalin. And then the first pangs of dread. There is
              silence.  The elevator stops.  A young, amorous Couple
              enters.  Both are about 24, and the Guy presses a number five
              flights down.  In a moment, we realize they are deaf.  They
              sign to each other, murmuring noises of love. And then the
              Guy signs something, obviously powerful, because the Girl
              emits a delighted gasp, as does Dorothy.  The Couple are
              truly in their own world.  They kiss before exiting on their
              floor.  And suddenly the elevator seems empty without them.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wonder what he said.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        My favorite aunt is hearing
                        impaired. He said "you complete
                        me."


                                                                     40.
 
 
              They continue on in silence.
 
              INT. BUILDING LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy pass through another office's party.  Loud
              music. It's a pre-Easter party thrown for the building
              employees and their children.  Jerry and Dorothy squeeze
              through with boxes and fish.
 
              EXT. SMI PARKING LOT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy walk to their cars.  Music in distance.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        So I know this is a bad time,
                        but -- you will have a medical
                        program, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
 
              He spaces out for a moment.  Awkwardly, she touches him
              briefly.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        And I guess we didn't talk about
                        money.  So, I'll just dive in --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Give me your number.  I'll call
                        tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm
                        a little insane right now.
                               (off her look)
                        But it's going to be great.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No no, I know --
 
              They arrive at her red Camry.  She writes her number on the
              back of a business card.
 
                                  JERRY
                        But I mean really... wonderfully...
                               (out of steam)
                        great.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (unsure)
                        Absolutely.
 
              She climbs into her car, rolls down the window.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And when you think about what
                        you've done later, don't panic.


                                                                     41.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Me?  No.  My sister -- it's a good
                        bet.
 
              She starts the engine.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        That took guts.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Same to you.
 
              She salutes him as she drives off.  His own move, played back
              to him.  Camera moves away from Jerry, as he stands alone in
              the parking lot.  Salutes her in return.  Herb Alpert.  "The
              Lonely Bull." Stripped of power, his once mighty theme now
              seems puny.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOME -- NIGHT
 
              Lights glow inside this small-but-cozy home on a side street
              in Manhattan Beach. Windows open.  The sound of women's
              voices.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              A living room filled with ten earnest, talkative Divorced
              Women. This is their talk group.  We meet JAN, 30, who speaks
              shyly, thoughtfully, covering her braces often as she speaks.
              She holds a too-full glass of red wine.  (Much of the talk in
              this Women's Group will be improved by our cast of actresses)
 
                                  JAN
                        I love men.  I respect men.  But
                        that doesn't change the fact that
                        most of them belong in cages...
 
              The other nine women nod with deep understanding.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy does the dishes.  Across the room, Laurel has her
              nightly cigarette, blowing smoke out the window.  She is a no-
              frills woman. She has some time ago shut off those aspects of
              her life spent pursuing the opposite sex.  They are in mid-
              argument.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        What about medical?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Of course, medical!


                                                                     42.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (unconvinced)
                        You are a single mother.  You have
                        given up the right to be frivolous.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (irritated)
                        If you'd read what he wrote, you
                        would have left with him too.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (more irritated)
                        You know how much those Well Child
                        exams cost --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (overlapping)
                        Of course I know --
 
                                  LAUREL/DOROTHY
                        A hundred and fifty dollars.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        And that's just when he's well --
 
              They talk over each other arguing for a moment and then:
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wait. Where is he?
 
                                  LAUREL
                        He's in the living room asleep.
 
              Dorothy dries her hands, flicking in a hurry.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wonderful.  Next time you lecture
                        me, don't leave my little boy in
                        a room with your Divorced Women's
                        Group...
 
              She exits in a hurry, as Laurel throws her cigarette into the
              garbage disposal.  She has a hard time saying this, so she
              says it so nobody can hear:
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Sorry.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Ray dreams sweetly in the middle of this rockbed of Women's
              Woes. Dorothy strokes his head, as she plucks him up.  In
              frame another woman, ALICE, 50, speaks passionately to the
              group.


                                                                     43.
 
 
                                  ALICE
                        Okay I've finally, finally, gotten
                        my anger straight here.  I'm going
                        to visualize Carl being here and
                        finally tell him --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Shhhh!
 
              Dorothy exits, protectively stroking her son's head.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Come on, buddy, we're going to bed.
 
              INT. HALLWAY-- NIGHT
 
              She stops for a moment, little boy in her hands.  The
              enormity of the day arrives with a thud.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (to herself)
                        What did I do?
 
              INT. JERRY'S CONDO -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry is quickly packing for a road trip.  Avery looks on.
              They are both in a manic state.
 
                                  JERRY
                        The power move is to go
                        unannounced.
                               (sotto)
                        Black suit, right?
 
                                  AVERY
                               (sotto)
                        And the egyptian cotton shirt that
                        works with or without the jacket.
                               (full volume)
                        Tell me again, how was it left
                        with Cush?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (perfect imitation)
                        "Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Ugh!
 
                                  JERRY
                               (turns, with clothes)
                        Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.
                               (sotto)
                        Jacket on, tie in pocket.


                                                                     44.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                               (sotta)
                        Good.
                               (full volume)
                        They're all heatseekers!  All of
                        them, everybody. You keep one
                        superstar and they'll all follow.
                        There's no real loyalty, and the
                        first person who told me that,
                        Jerry Maguire, was you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think I was trying to sleep with
                        you at the time.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Well, it worked, and I will not
                        let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma-
                        fuckin-guire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        That's right.
 
                                  AVERY
                        King of the Housecalls! Master of
                        the Living Room!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, this is working.
 
                                  AVERY
                        You are not a loser.
 
              Jerry stops, turns.  The way she says "loser" is the most
              elegant of disses. She wraps her lips around it like a cheap
              hot dog.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Who said anything about "loser?"
                        Where do you get this word "loser?"
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I
                        meant something else.  When do you
                        want to leave?
 
              Jerry zips his brown travel bag shut.  He is packed and ready.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Let's go.  I'll drive you.


                                                                     45.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (stops, an odd
                                thought)
                        What if I don't get him?
 
              Avery takes his bag, heads for the door.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Function function function.
                        Forward motion is everything.
                        Cush saves all.
 
              Jerry takes a breath, exits.  Music.
 
              AIRPLANE WHEELS
 
              folding up.  Music continues.
 
              INT. RENT-A-CAR -- MORNING
 
              Jerry drives the bumpiest Texas backroad ever.
 
              Music continues.
 
              EXT. CUSHMAN DOOR -- DAY
 
              Jerry exits car.  Adjusts the jacket.  Takes the tie off too,
              returns to the car and tosses it inside.  He walks to the
              front door with purpose.  Suddenly an intercom crackles,
              jolting him with a booming and cheerful voice:
 
                                  MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
                        No sports agents allowed!  Ha ha.
 
              Jerry spots the small electronic camera pointed at him from
              the upper-corner of this rustic home.  The door buzzes.
 
              INT. CUSHMAN HALLWAY/DEN -- DAY
 
              Jerry  follows the voice down a hallway  loaded with Cush
              memorabilia.  Righteous indignation building.
 
                                  MATT CUSHMAN'S VOICE
                        I'm in the back den, Jerry.
 
              He moves into the den, finding MATT CUSHMAN, 40, who stands
              at the living room bar. Two framed game jerseys on the wall.
              A large draped American flag above the bar.  He is a J. Crew
              cowboy.
 
                                  MATT
                        You like a Bloody Beer, Jerry?
                        Beer and tomato juice --


                                                                     46.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        No thanks.
 
              Maguire takes a breath, and sharply begins his pitch.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Matt, I came here because in all
                        honesty your son is just another
                        piece of cattle to SMI.  But to
                        me --
 
                                  MATT
                               (overlapping)
                        We decided to stay with you.
 
              On pure instinct, he hugs Matt Cushman.  The move surprises
              them both.  And somewhere out of nowhere, come a few
              surprising tears of relief.  He has been spared.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh, thank you.
 
                                  MATT
                        Told myself -- if he shows up,
                        we'll stick with him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You know, I'm not a hugger and
                        yet... I can't let go.
 
              Matt laughs, as Cush lopes in from the kitchen.  Little
              brother KEITH, 14, enters with him.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Hey, Jerry, what's been going on?
 
              INT. DEN -- LATER DAY -- HANDHELD
 
              Cush, Matt and Jerry brainstorm around the ceremonial "wagon-
              wheel table" where decisions are made in this house.  Jerry
              is giddy, charged up, a part of the human race again.
 
                                  MATT
                        I want him to go number one in the
                        draft, and I want him to play.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's either going to be Denver or
                        San Diego trading up to take him.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (big grin)
                        Hell, I'll either surf or ski. I
                        don't care.


                                                                     47.
 
 
                                  MATT
                        Denver is where he should be.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll give it everything.
 
                                  MATT
                        You know I don't do "contracts."
                        But'cha do have my word, and it's
                        stronger than oak.
 
              Jerry toasts Matt with a bloody beer.  A good day.
 
              INT. RENT-A-CAR/TEXAS -- DAY
 
              Jerry drives back on the same bumpy road.  On the radio, it's
              the Rolling Stones.  He wants to sing along.  He thinks he
              knows the words, but...
 
                                  JERRY
                               (sings)
                        Feelin...
 
              He realizes he doesn't know the words at all. He switches
              channels. Finds a Rush song, with ornate lyrics.  No one will
              ever know what the words are.  He switches again and finds
              "Let's Groove Tonight" by Earth, Wind and Fire. Excellent.
              He begins singing nonsense noises, passionately.  Switches
              again.  All he wants is to sing along with a song he knows.
              Finally he finds Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' "Refugee."
              He drives through the countryside, singing the call and
              response of the song, like a happy idiot.
 
              INT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry turns into shot.  He's on the pay-phone.  He's jacked.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Dorothy? Jerry Maguire!  Is Avery
                        there? Where can I reach her?
 
                                                       INTERCUT
 
 
 
              INT. DOROTHY/LAUREL'S HOUSE -- DAY
 
              Dorothy is at her home work desk.  Curious and nervous about
              the new arrangement.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Uh, she had to fly to Atlanta,
                        didn't leave me her hotel number.


                                                                     48.
 
 
              Through the back kitchen door comes CHAD THE NANNY, 29, red
              hair cropped above the ear. Baggy overalls.  Slipping through
              life with little turbulence.  He's with Ray, who holds pieces
              of wood and a hammer.
 
                                  CHAD
                        The new playhouse rocks, Dotty.
 
                                  RAY
                               (jumping)
                        Yeah!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Honey -- later, okay?
                               (Ray jumps on her)
                        Whoop.  Wait.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (back to phone)
                        Sorry, that's my son and the
                        nanny. I had the calls transferred
                        to my home so I could go over your
                        stuff.
 
              Chad now notices the slight excited tone in her demeanor.  He
              sits down nearby and listens to her talk to Maguire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, that's fine.  What calls came
                        in today?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wait.  That's yesterday, from the
                        other office. Today is...
 
              She flips the call record from yesterday --150 calls -- to
              today, which is blank.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        ... light.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Shit, it's just so frustrating to
                        not be able to talk to Avery --
 
                                  AVERY
                        Wait a minute, it has to be one of
                        the NFL hotels we do business
                        with -- let me look -- but in the
                        meantime, about this job --


                                                                     49.
 
 
              She reaches over Ray to get to her laptop and buzzes through
              a list of phone numbers.  Jerry can't help but share the qood
              news:
 
                                  JERRY
                               (importantly)
                        Dorothy, let me tell you
                        something, we are back. We are so
                        very very back.  I re-signed Cush.
                        We're set.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We are?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's all going to work.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I just got goosebumps.
 
              She examines her own skin with surprise.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (manic, quiet)
                        It's all going to work.  We're
                        going to save the world.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Well, I'm happy for you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Happy for us.
 
              Oddly, the phrase affects her physically.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Happy for us... okay.  Here's the
                        number. 404-453-2222.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Thanks.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Call me later, hon.
 
              She hangs up, and looks over to Laurel and Chad. Both of them
              stare at her.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
 
                                  CHAD
                               (laughing)
                        Yeah, Dotty. You did.


                                                                     50.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Twenty six years old.  I'm already
                        saying "hon". Hug your mother
                        quickly --
 
              Chad looks at her, something is different about Dorothy.
              Laurel walks away, sharing a look with Chad.
 
              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry is now teeming with energy, professional and sexual.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Avery, I signed Cush.  Again.
 
                                                       INTERCUT
 
              INT. ATLANTA HOTEL SUITE -- DAY
 
              Avery in mid-conference with four other NFL men in background.
 
                                  AVERY
                        YA-HOOOO-SIE!
 
              It is the victory call of the competitive girl, and she falls
              back into a chair, kicking her expensive shoes onto the bed.
              In the b.g. we see the hungry look of her male co-workers.
              Part of them lusts after her.  The larger part knows she
              would demolish them, and pick her teeth with their bones.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I know.  Sorry I threw a scare
                        into our lives there --
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't worry about it -- I never
                        told you what I thought of that
                        memo either --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, no you didn't --
 
                                  AVERY
                        You lost your head, it happens.
                               (quickly)
                        I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen.
                        I'm going to have to fly to
                        Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we
                        meet in the Dallas airport and we
                        all fly into New York together for
                        the draft?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a plan --  --

                                  AVERY
                        I'll set it up with your girl.
                        Woo!  This is when it's good,
                        Jerry. Enjoy it. Live it.  Love
                        it.  And when I see you, I'm going
                        to give you the best blow job of
                        your life.
 
              He hangs up, staring at the phone. In the room with Avery,
              the co-workers look at each other. She is far, far out of
              their league.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S CAR -- LATER MORNING -- DRIVING
 
              Dorothy Boyd speeds Jerry to the airport, the electricity
              fills the car. On the radio, a sports station debates the
              future of Cushman. as Jerry whips through a stack of sports
              pages.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Avery'll meet you at the B gate at
                        4:15.  Don't be late. Tidwell will
                        already be there.
 
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (nods to Ray)
                        Hey, man, you know they have big
                        balloons built into cars?
 
                                  RAY
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        They do, my brother.
 
                                  RAY
                               (giggling)
                        I'm not your brother!
 
              Dorothy continues, business on her mind.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        ... I put Tidwell on the same
                        floor at the Marriott Marquis.  I
                        think it's great you're taking him
                        to the draft. He doesn't smoke,
                        right? I have no idea.


                                                                     52.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I have no idea.
                               (continuing to Ray)
                        So Ray, if there's an accident or
                        something, it goes pwoooooooof --
                               (simulates air-bag)
                        -- and you go booooong.  And
                        you're safe.
 
              Jerry bounces against the imaginary balloon.  Ray is
              delighted by Jerry.   Dorothy notes that he's great with her
              son.  She pats Jerry on the shoulder.  Her hand lingers
              perhaps a millisecond too long.  She pulls away quickly,
              always feeling on the edge or embarrassing herself around
              this guy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay, have we gone over
                        everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yep.  Have a good time at school,
                        Ray.  Wish me luck.
 
                           DOROTHY                       RAY
                   Luck.                         LUCK!
 
              Jerry nods and exits.  They watch as Jerry inches into the
              crowded airport.  Into frame, obscuring their view of Jerry,
              enters another Couple, who embrace each other and their small
              girl.   It's a genuinely sweet goodbye, and we linger on
              Dorothy and Ray who both watch with private fantasies of the
              goodbye they didn't get. Mother and son look at each other,
              communicating volumes. They pull back into traffic.
 
              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry struggles through the Dallas airport, is the last, of
              his party to arrive at the B gate in Dallas.  Avery, tall and
              cool in plaid skirt and shades, is in combat mode.   Nearby,
              Cush is surrounded by fans and fawning Airline Employees.
              ("Where do you think you're gonna end up, Cush?"  "You gonna
              be rich, dude!") Tidwell looks jealous and ingnored as he
              leans against the airline counter, unnoticed.  A lone kid
              approaches Tidwell.
 
                                  KID
                        Are you Hootie?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        No man, I'm not Hootie.
 
              Kid leaves disappointed. Tidwell sinks lower. Doesn't anyone
              know his stardom, his essence, his power?


                                                                     53.
 
 
                                  BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT
                        All those disabled, and Frank
                        Cushman can board now...
 
              INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY
 
              Jerry sits next to Cushman, who is reading Bukowski's Notes
              of a Dirty Old Man.  Across the aisle is Tidwell, who sits
              next to Avery.  They are a small family, and Jerry feels at
              home with his operation.  Cush looks up suddenly.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (a big thought)
                        Jerry.  Why does God sometimes
                        reward the evil and punish the
                        good?
 
              Jerry shares a look with Avery, who is on the other side of
              Cush. Her stockings swish as she crosses her legs.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Let me think about that.  Want
                        something to drink?
 
                                  CUSH
                               (thoughtful pause)
                        I see what you're saying.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait.  What do you mean?
 
              The two men have now totally confused each other. Tidwell
              leans across the aisle to Cush, attempting comraderie.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hey man, I wish I had a
                        quarterback like you in Arizona.
                        You're the shit.
 
              Cush looks up.  Compliments blow off him like a summer breeze.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Thank ya.
 
              Tidwell waits for a compliment of his own, but Cush doesn't
              offer one.  He returns to the book.  Tidwell feels slighted.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (loud mumble)
                        Well you ain't that mothafuckin
                        good.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Say what?


                                                                     54.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I said -- last I heard, Jesus
                        Christ was still in heaven.  And
                        you ain't even played in the NFL.
 
              Cush throws his book away, ready for anything, as Tidwell
              rises. Nearby passengers begin to panic.
 
                                  JERRY
                        This can't be happening to me.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry!  Do something --
 
              Jerry throws himself in front of Cushman.
 
                                  JERRY
                        HEY.  Knock it off.  What are you,
                        five years old?  Am I taking the
                        kids to Chuck E. Cheese here? Grow
                        up, both of you!  We are a family.
                        And we go to the draft in an
                        ORDERLY FASHION.
 
              Beat. Jerry wonders if he's pushed his mealtickets around too
              much.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hey, man, I dig Check E. Cheese.
 
                                  CUSH
                        Me too, dude.  Especially that big
                        old singin' Elvis Monkey.  That's
                        just insanity, man.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Heard that.
 
              Tidwell reaches over, he and Cush exchange a fingertips five.
              Briefly, the two clients bond. Past Tidwell, Avery smiles
              engagingly at Jerry.  He handled the situation well.  She
              crosses her legs, stockings swishing.  The workplace excites
              her.
 
              EXT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS -- NIGHT
 
              The headquarters for the NFL draft is buzzing with activity.
              Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company.  Media
              lights flick on, bathing Cush.  Reporters chatter. ("Is it
              San Diego or Denver, Cush?N  "Cush!")  Fans at the outskirts
              are calling out to the young star ("Go get the big chi-ching,
              Cush!") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position.
              Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. ("I'll either surf or
              ski.")  Jerry admires his fiancee.  There is nothing more
              attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job.


                                                                     55.
 
 
              Shot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at
              the outskirts.  He turns and exits unnoticed.
 
              INT. GIFT SHOP -- NIGHT -- LATER
 
              Tidwell hides out in the gift shop, thumbing through
              magazines. The chip on his shoulder grows by the minute.
              Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and
              emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother.  Both wear
              self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young
              athlete's face on it.  Something about them, their pure
              enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way.  He almost cries, for
              himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters.  Tidwell is
              embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state.
 
                                  JERRY
                        At last I find you.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (sharply)
                        Why the fuck am I here?  I feel
                        like I'm five years late for the
                        Prom.
 
              In a look, Jerry sizes up the situation.  With a hand on
              Tidwell's large shoulder, he smoothly pumps up the big man's
              ego.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Come on.  Come with me.  We're
                        going to take a walk through this
                        lobby. I want every media guy,
                        every player rep, everybody to see
                        you for what you are.  The best-
                        kept secret in the NFL. The
                        biggest wide-receiver in the game.
                        Let 'em see ya, Rod.  And Whatever
                        you do, don't sit down. Let 'em
                        see how big you are.  You ready?
                        Let's do it.
 
              He is privately thrilled, but offers only:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (begrudgingly)
                        A'right.  Let's walk.
 
              We hear the ripping guitar explosion of The Who's "Magic Bus"
              from Live at Leeds.


                                                                     56.
 
 
              INT. MARRIOTT LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Maguire and Tidwell move through the brightly-lit lobby, past
              the reporters, the competing agents, the team
              representatives, the already blasted Jets fans, past even a
              Nike crew filming an NFL spot in the lobby.  Portable phones
              everywhere, in every hand.
 
              There is a heavy white media light bathing everything -- as
              if life had become a t.v. show, and everything within it
              concerned making other t.v. shows.  Jerry works hard,
              introduces Tidwell around. And Tidwell is natural, polite and
              charming, as they move through the pre-draft crowd.  He does
              not sit down.  Music continues.
 
              INT. MARRIOTT BAR -- DAY
 
              Tough red-headed beat reporter PATRICIA LOGAN watches Maguire
              and Tidwell from the opposite corner.
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Dennis, try not to laugh.  Jerry
                        Maguire brought Rod Tidwell to the
                        draft...
 
              INT. ARIZONA CARDINALS WAR ROOM PHOENIX) -- NIGHT
 
              Arizona General Manager DENNIS WILBURN, 48, is on the phone
              here in the command center for the Arizona Cardinals.  All
              around him, we see the boards and graphs for their upcoming
              draft selections.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        Good, I hope he unloads him so I
                        can buy a decent quarterback.
                        Who's he talking to?
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Right now, Dallas.  Ha ha.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        They don't look interested do they?
 
                                  PATRICIA
                        Actually...
 
              Wilburn looks concerned.
 
              INT. MARRIOTT ESCALATOR -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level
              above the bright-white lobby.  Maguire looks down at the
              scene.  He breathes in the commotion.  In another twelve
              hours, he will be at the very epicenter with Cushman.


                                                                     57.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I came all the way here for that?
                        To walk the lobby?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah.  And it might have even
                        worked too.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Let's do it again.
 
              Jerry doesn't respond.  Down in the lobby, Jerry catches a
              glimpse of a familiar-looking agent.  It's Sugar. Jerry is
              consumed with a thousand other thoughts, but Tidwell
              continues talking.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        You believe they're shooting a
                        Nike ad down there?  Did I ever
                        tell you my Nike story?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I gotta get back to Cushman.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it
                        down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they
                        do is ignore me...
 
              Jerry turns to Tidwell, finally focusing totally on him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You know what was great about you
                        down there?  For about five
                        minutes, you unloaded that rather
                        expansive, let me just say "large"
                        chip that resides right there on
                        your shoulder, and you know what?
                        You were brilliant.  Take care.
 
              Jerry starts to exit.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You're loving me now, aren't ya?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (mock serious)
                        I'm not about love -- I'm about
                        "showing you the money."
 
              Tidwell nods deeply, respectfully.


                                                                     58.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good.  I was just testing ya.
                               (beat)
                        But just you saying that? Makes me
                        love ya.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Sure you don't want to go out and
                        find some karoake?  I'm a very
                        good singer, man --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Call me tomorrow.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I might call you later!
 
              Tidwell moves off, still feeling good about the walk.  A
              small pack of diehard Jets fans pass, looking for autographs.
 
              INT. CUSH'S SUITE -- NIGHT
 
              We glide into Frank Cushman's suite overlooking Times Square.
              It's filled with NFL swag -- free t-shirts, athletic bags,
              sweatpants, and more.  Half-finished room service food
              abounds.  Matt, Keith and Cush's stylish college girlfriend
              ANNE-LOUISE mill about the room, basking in the glow of the
              man of the moment.  Cush, who holds a guitar in his lap,
              wears the odd combination of a Nirvana t-shirt and a NFL
              jacket.  He signs for more room service and continues
              strumming the only song he knows on guitar, Cobain's
              "Something In The Way."  Jerry enters on a rush of adrenalin.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (to hotel waiter)
                        Hey, what size are you?
 
                                  WAITER
                        Eleven.
 
                                  CUSH
                               (grandly)
                        Why don't you grab a couple pairs
                        of them new Nikes by the door --
 
              Waiter spots a very tall stack of new Nikes by the door.
 
                                  WAITER
                        Dude, you're like a God.


                                                                     59.
 
 
                                  CUSH
                               (immediately)
                        God, you're like a dude.
 
              It's a great line, and the room breaks up.  This is charisma,
              the future of the NFL.  Waiter exits, as Cush continues
              strumming. And now Jerry speaks, importantly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Cush, Matt -- we have a decision
                        to make.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "It's okay to eat fish, 'cause
                        they Don't have any feelings...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay. San Diego just came in with
                        a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "Something in the way.  Yeah."
 
                                  MATT
                        Well, he's gotta go number one.
 
                                  CUSH
                        "Ooooooo."
 
                                  JERRY
                        He still goes number one, but San
                        Diego wants to trade up with New
                        England -- they want him bad.
 
              Cush turns to his curiously ambivalent father, who walks to
              the window and looks out at the big Jumbotron with Keith.
 
                                  MATT
                        What happened to Denver?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Denver got very silent about a day
                        ago.  San Diego's got a fever for
                        Cush.  This stuff tends to happen
                        the night before a draft.  People
                        get crazy.  And San Diego, you
                        should know, is crazy to the tune
                        of seven years for thirty. Signing
                        bonus of eight.
                               (beat)
                        Million.
 
              Anne-Louise whistles loudly.  She is instantly embarrassed,
              and puts a hand up.  Sorry.  In the next room, the phone is
              ringing.


                                                                     60.
 
 
                                  MATT
                        I don't know, Jerry.
 
                                  KEITH
                        Should I unplug the phone?
 
                                  CUSH
                        Reporters, Jerry.  They been
                        callin' all night.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Just be friendly and say "no
                        comment."
 
                                  CUSH
                        Talking and saying nothing, man,
                        it's an art I have not mastered.
 
              Jerry holds up a finger -- watch me.  Jerry picks up the
              ringing phone. He offers a near-perfect imitation.
 
                                  JERRY
                        "This is Cush."
 
              Suddenly, everyone is, laughing.  The room lightens.
 
              INT. BOB SUGAR'S HOTEL ROOM -- DAY
 
              Bob Sugar talks on his hotel phone.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        It's Sugar.  He must be there,
                        right? Just sniff or something if
                        he's there.
                               (Jerry sniffs,
                                panicked)
                        Alright, buddydude.  Just
                        remember. You're swimming with the
                        big boys now. You let your dad do
                        all the talking.  I'm the one who
                        got you the deal you needed.  This
                        is business not friendship. Be
                        strong.  You're global now.
 
              Sugar hangs up.
 
                                  JERRY
                        "No comment.
 
              Jerry hangs up.  The room is still laughing.  His head is
              spinning.
 
                                  KEITH
                        Hey, it's Cush on the big t.v.
                        again!


                                                                     61.
 
 
                                  CUSH
                        Hell, I'm already sick of me. I
                        got "Cushlash."
 
              More laughs. Jerry sits across from Matt, reeling quietly. He
              speaks casually, directly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, before I go back to Denver.
                        I think we should put something
                        down on paper.  Something that
                        says, "hey, I'm with Jerry
                        Maguire."
 
              He pulls out a yellow legal tablet.  He scribbles a few
              lines, as Matt looks increasingly nervous.
 
                                  MATT
                        Not right now, Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Do I know everything there is to
                        know here?
                               (silent beat)
                        You fellas aren't talking with Bob
                        Sugar, are you?
 
              More silence.
 
                                  MATT
                        Apparently, Denver wanted to deal
                        with him instead of you.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (quickly)
                        Said who?  Sugar?
 
                                  MATT
                        Hey, I'm learning as I go.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal
                        with Denver behind my back?
 
                                  MATT
                        I'm sorry, I --
 
                                  JERRY
                        I brought Denver to twenty
                        million. Denver deals with me all
                        the time. You listened to Sugar?
                        You let that snake in the door.
 
              Jerry touches the coffee table.  Calms himself.


                                                                     62.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        It's okay.  You want Denver. I'll
                        fix this up.  You didn't sign
                        anything with Sugar, right?
 
              Another rough silence is broken by little brother Keith.
 
                                  KEITH
                               (blurts)
                        Mr. Maguire, someday I'm gonna be
                        a famous athlete and I'm gonna
                        sign with you'.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Shut up!
                               (beat)
                        I'm sorry... sorry.
 
                                  KEITH
                               (sympathy for Jerry)
                        S' cool.
 
              Shot moves in on Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually
                        sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me
                        you didn't sign.
                               (beat)
                        Because I'm still sort of moved by
                        your "my word is stronger'n oak"
                        thing --
 
                                  MATT
                        We signed an hour ago.  You were
                        in the lobby with the black fella.
 
              Jerry moans. Silently, he rises and begins to gather his
              things. Cush hangs on to his guitar.
 
                                  CUSH
                        I'm sorry, Jerry.
 
                                  MATT
                        They say it's show "business,"
                        Jerry, not show friends.
 
              Jerry takes a breath before he exits. He surveys the room,
              settling on Cush.  Visible behind Maguire is Times Square, in
              all it's neon logo glory.


                                                                     63.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well. Okay. Of course. You're
                        twenty years old, and I'm just
                        another guy in a suit.  It's all
                        business. It didn't work out.  You
                        didn't buy my product, which is,
                        unfortunately, mm. Let me see,
                        there's a speech that I'm supposed
                        to make -- right! -- "I'll be out
                        there cheering for you." "The door
                        is always open!"  See? I'm a class
                        act.
                               (breath, directly)
                        But maybe this would have all
                        worked, us being real human
                        beings, coming through for each
                        other, really, and now I'll never
                        know. You'll never know. Weren't
                        you curious?
                               (they aren't)
                        No.  Okay, well, I'll be fine.
                        And you'll be fine.  And Keith I
                        bope you do call me.
 
              Flushed and embarrassed, he exits.  We hang a beat on the
              silent Cushman hotel livingroom, as Cush now continues on
              guitar.
 
              INT. LOBBY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry exits elevator dazed, at full trot.  The Marriott lobby
              is packed.  He is looking for Avery.  Beat reporter Patricia
              Logan reappears.  She relishes asking brutal questions,
              innocently.
 
                                  PATRICIA LOGAN
                        Jerry, is it true that Tidwell's
                        had three concussions?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm sorry... excuse me...
 
              INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters the grand ballroom, looking for Avery.
              Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere.  NFL reps and
              media workers move tables and work out camera and seating
              arrangements.  Elevated in a open ESPN booth six feet off the
              ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's
              draft.  Fans heckle him by singing the ESPN theme.  He rolls
              with it, expertly.  Jerry spots Avery across the empty
              ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty
              tables.


                                                                     64.
 
 
              INT. ADJACENT BUFFET ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry finally catches up with Avery in the empty side-room.
 
                                  AVERY
                        I just heard.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What do I do?  How do I spin this?
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh honey.  It's spun.
 
              She keeps moving, adding an extra snap to the packets.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What did I do to you?
 
              She is furious with his question.  Doesn't he know?
 
                                  AVERY
                        It's all about you, isn't it?
                        Soothe me, save me, love me --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Could you just stop moving?
 
                                  AVERY
                        I have to finish my job --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Everything's on the fucking run!
                        Everything --
 
              She stops.  Walks to him, framed by a bank of t.v. monitors.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry.  You and I are salespeople.
                        We sell --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, I don't want a --
 
                                  AVERY
                        It's not "love me."  It's not
                        "trust my handshake."  It's make
                        the sale. Get it signed.  There
                        shouldn't be "confusion" about
                        that.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Go ahead.  Jump right on into my
                        nightmare.  The water's warm.


                                                                     65.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        So honesty is outlawed here, I
                        can't be honest?
 
              She turns and exits again.  He follows.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tell you what -- I'd prefer
                        loyalty..
 
                                  AVERY
                        What was our deal when we first
                        got together?  Brutal truth,
                        remember?
 
                                  JERRY
                        I think you added the "brutal."
 
              She stops, slaps down another media packet.  Blows a
              troublesome piece of hair out of her face.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Jerry, there is a "sensitivity"
                        thing that some people have.  I
                        don't have it.  I don't cry at
                        movies.  I don't gush over babies.
                        I don't start celebrating
                        Christmas five months early, and
                        I don't tell a man who just
                        screwed up both of our lives --
                        'oh, poor baby.'  That's me.  For
                        better or worse.  But I do love
                        you.
 
              Jerry looks at his fiancee.  Standing here, watching Avery
              coldly clasping her media packs to her chest, she looks
              different to him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Avery --
 
              She knows what's coming.  She moves fast to avoid him.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Don't say it.  We're both ragged
                        out right now.
 
                                  JERRY
                        -- stop --
 
              She exits back into the main ballroom.  For a moment, she
              stops. They face off.  This is it.  They are quickly
              interrupted by overweight, talk-show voiced CURTIS WEINTRAUB,
              45.


                                                                     66.
 
 
                                  CURTIS WEINTRAUB
                        Hey!  Curtis Weintraub from the
                        Sports Popper!  Haven't seen you
                        two since the Cuervo Gold Rock 'n
                        Sock Charity Six Flags Budfest!
                        Hello!
 
              Neither look at him, they remain fixed on each other.  Curtis
              gets a whiff of what he walked into.
 
                                  CURTIS WEINTRAUB
                               (continuing; exiting
                                quickly)
                        Goodbye!
 
                                  AVERY
                        I'm warning you.  Don't say it.
                        You won't have another chance.
 
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen to me!
 
                                  AVERY
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's over --
 
              She continues moving into the next room.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Didn't hear it.
 
                                  JERRY
                        There is something missing here.
 
                                  AVERY
                        You've never been alone and you
                        can't be alone --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Listen to me, it's over.
 
              She can barely believe it.  She blinks.
 
                                  AVERY
                        No one has ever dumped me.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm not trying to make history.


                                                                     67.
 
 
                                  AVERY
                        I did the 23 hour nose-route to
                        the top of El Capitan in 6 hours!
                        I can make this work.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it slips out)
                        No.
 
              She takes a breath.  It sinks in.  From somewhere, the small
              voice of her vulnerability.
 
                                  AVERY
                        Oh Jerry.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (steps closer)
                        You know I didn't ever want to
                        hurt you.
 
              She gets an odd look, shaking her head.  Starts to step away,
              then thinks better of it.  She WALLOPS him in the face with
              the back of her hand.  Jerry stands like a woozy boxer. She
              hits him again with a fist, then again in the chest.  He
              sinks to the floor, sagging. backwards.  She straddles him,
              addresses him fully, right in his bruised face.
 
                                  AVERY
                        I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
                        I'm too strong for you.  Loser.
 
              INT. JFK AIRPORT -- NEXT MORNING
 
              Jerry moves through the crowded airport with Rod Tidwell.
              Both wear sunglasses.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You love me now, don't you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Very much.
 
              ON TV MONITOR -- ROY FIRESTONE
 
              is leaning forward, expressively, talking with a weepy
              athlete.
 
              INT. RED CARPET LOUNGE -- DAY
 
              Tidwell watches next to Jerry, as they wait for the flight.
              Jerry nurses a stiff drink.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Everybody on this show cries now.


                                                                     68.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (off t.v. )
                        You feel bad you tested positive?
                        Quit doing blow!  You feel bad
                        about your baby girl? Why did you
                        leave the mother?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What are you doing with me, Rod?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Huh?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't you even see -- I'm
                        finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four
                        hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm
                        a cautionary tale!
 
              Tidwell looks at Jerry, impassive.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        See this jacket I'm wearing?  You
                        like it?  I don't really need it,
                        because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE.
                        I lost the number one draft pick
                        the night before the draft. They
                        will teach my story to other
                        agents on "do not do this" day in
                        agent school. Why? Let's recap.
                        Because a hockey player's kid made
                        me feel like a superficial jerk,
                        I had two slices of bad pizza,
                        went to bed, grew a conscience and
                        wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        The least you could do is nod and
                        act sympathetic --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (shaking head)
                        No.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a quality that might come in
                        handy for a commercial sometime.


                                                                     69.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You are not allowed to act this
                        way.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why not?
 
              INT. AIRPLANE -- LATER DAY
 
              They sit together. Jerry holds another drink.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Man, I got a shelf life of ten
                        years, tops!  My next contract's

                        last me and mine a very long time.
                        I'm out of this sport in five
                        years.  What's my family gonna
                        live on? What you get me.  So I
                        don't want to hear about ya shit,
                        your "nya nya nya."
 
                                  JERRY
                               (ruefully, to
                                attendant)
                        Another drink please.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Anybody else would have left you
                        by now, but I'm sticking with you.
                        I said I would. And if I got to
                        ride your ass like Zorro, you're
                        gonna show me the money.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (the hell that never
                                ends)
                        Oh my God.
 
              He looks straight ahead, at the airphone in front of him.
 
              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy finds Laurel on their small porch.  There is only
              room for a miniature garden and one comfortable seat. Laurel
              sits in it.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's coming over.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        At eleven at night?


                                                                     70.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He just lost his best client.  He
                        called from the plane.  I invited
                        the guy over.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This
                        is a "syndrome."  It's called
                        Early Midlife, About-To-Marry,
                        Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear-
                        God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll-
                        Call-My-Newly Long-suffering-
                        Assistant-Without Medical-For-
                        Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing
                        all that, you still allow him to
                        come over, more power to you.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Honey, he's engaged.  And for the
                        first time in my professional
                        life, I'm a part of something I
                        believe in.
 
              Dorothy exits.  Laurel shakes her head, calls to next room.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Okay, but he better not be good
                        looking!
 
              INT. RAY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy puts Ray to bed.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        'Night buddy.  This is my favorite
                        part of your head.
 
              She kisses the corner of his forehead, rising up into the
              mirror.
 
              She checks her look, in spite of herself. Visible on the wall
              above Ray's bed, is her ex-husband's photo. Music.
 
              INT. CAB -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in back of a cab, wearing sunglasses, three drinks
              later, post-flight, rolling with anything.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, turn here!  Sharp right
                        turn. 8831 3/4 Waterloo.
 
              The cab turns onto a very small street.  Cars parked on both
              sides. Down the street, another pair of headlights.


                                                                     71.
 
 
              Jerry's cab refuses to give in, in fact he floors it.  Same
              with the oncoming car.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Yes, good, floor it, kill us!!
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Door opens to reveal Jerry Maguire with brown bag, shoulder
              hang-up bag, disheveled hair and sunglasses.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm Jerry Maguire.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (super pleasant)
                        You seem just the way I pictured
                        you. I'm her disapproving sister
                        Laurel.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Honesty.  Thank you.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM
 
              Jerry enters, as Dorothy rounds the corner.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey you.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi.
 
              The lights are low and his glasses are very dark.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Thanks for inviting me over.
                        Where's the little guy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's asleep.  Watch out for that
                        lamp.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm glad you're home.  That
                        "alone" thing is... not my
                        specialty...
 
              He ducks the lamp, barely. Laurel exits through his shot,
              miming "drinking" behind his back. Jerry takes off his
              glasses, revealing a welt and a cut below his eye.


                                                                     72.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh my God.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with
                        Avery.
 
              Dorothy's entire body chemistry changes in ways she doesn't
              quite understand.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Too bad.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Better now than later.  We'll
                        still be friends. I'm dying here.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
 
                                  JERRY
                        And just think if I got her the
                        ring she really wanted.
 
              Dorothy laughs.  He looks at her strangely.  Suddenly she
              feels very nervous, as he sets down his bags.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a
                        seat. I'll get you some aloe vera
                        for that cut too.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Do you have something to drink?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sure --
 
              She moves to the kitchen door.  She is about to exit, when
              Jerry begins to unburden.
 
                                  JERRY
                        My brother works for the White
                        House. He pretends he's an
                        intellectual.  He pretends he's
                        from the east coast.
 
              She turns, not quite sure what his point is.  She waits
              politely for Jerry to finish before exiting into the kitchen.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I was supposed to be the
                        successful one.
                                  (more)


                                                                     73.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        But I don't want to talk about it.
                        And yet!  My family.  I grew up
                        with repression as a... a
                        religion --you don't bitch.  No
                        moaning!  Head down.  Do it,
                        whatever "it" may be. My dad... he
                        worked for the United Way for 38
                        years!  You know what he said when
                        he retired? He said, "I wish I'd
                        had a more comfortable chair." 38
                        years he sat in it!  Do you know
                        what I'm saying, Dorothy?
                        Repression as a religion. I'm
                        almost as old as his chair.
 
              He rubs his face.  She looks at him, and the situation
              slightly overwhems her. Here he is, wide-open, ripe for the
              taking.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Beer okay?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, thanks.
 
              INT. KITCHEN
 
              Laurel smokes a cigarette and blows it out the window.
              Dorothy goes for the refrigerator, finds a couple beers.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        I heard.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No kidding.  I looked over and saw
                        the shadow of two curious shoes in
                        the doorway of the kitchen.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        This guy would go home with a
                        gardening tool right now if it
                        showed interest.
                               (off Dorothy's look)
                        Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (surprised)
                        Thank you.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Look, here's some of that chicken
                        with salsa too, I warmed it up --


                                                                     74.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        That's the girl I love.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        But you just gotta hear me out on
                        one thing.  You're very
                        responsible with Ray and you know
                        it's not right for a little boy to
                        hear some strange man's voice in
                        the house.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        As opposed to twenty angry women?
 
              Dorothy turns quickly and the beer, sisters and chicken
              collide in the small kitchen.  Dorothy deftly catches the
              food in her t-shirt, and dumps it back onto the plate.  But
              her shirt is now stained. She starts to quietly implode, and
              Laurel takes command.  They know each other well.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Come on, let's get you another
                        top --
 
              They exit to nearby laundry room.
 
              EXT. HOUSE/WINDOW OUTSIDE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Now camera starts to move around the house, from this window
              showing the two sisters in the laundry room, to the living
              room where Jerry sits alone.  We see Ray wander into the room
              and stare at Jerry.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry, who is playing with a kaleidoscope on the table, looks
              up to see Ray.
 
                                  RAY
                        Hi.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hi Ray.
 
              INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- SAME TIME
 
                                  LAUREL
                        All I'm saying.  You don't have
                        the luxury of falling for some
                        drowning man.  Be practical.  Now.
                        Which top?
 
              She holds up two tops.  One is sexier with a dipped down
              front. The other is striped, cute, functional.


                                                                     75.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay, you want to talk about
                        practical? Let's talk about my
                        wonderful life. Do you know what
                        most other women my age are doing
                        right now? They are partying in
                        clubs, trying to act stupid,
                        trying to get a man, trying to
                        keep a man... not me. I'm trying
                        to RAISE a man.
 
              She grabs the sexier top, and puts it on.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I've got a 24 hour a day reminder
                        of Roger, for the rest of my life.
                        I have had three lovers in four
                        years, all boring, all achingly
                        self-sufficient all friends of
                        yours I might add, and all of them
                        running a distant second to a warm
                        bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at
                        me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in
                        the world!  How do I look?
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Good.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Thanks.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Ray have a great conversation, playing tug with a
              piece of rope.
 
                                  RAY
                        And then my dad died and my mom
                        took me to the zoo and I love the
                        zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you
                        love the zoo?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait.  I want to tell you more
                        about my dad.
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's go the zoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay.  I've been hogging it.
                        You're right.
                                  (more)


                                                                     76.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        All my life I've been trying to
                        talk, really talk, and no one
                        wants to listen.  You know that
                        feeling?
 
              Ray nods vigorously.
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's go right now.  Let's go to
                        the zoo.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw, the fucking thing... I mean,
                        the zoo is closed.
 
                                  RAY
                        You said "fuck".
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah I know.  I did.
 
              Ray loves this guy.  He pats Jerry's knee.
 
                                  RAY
                        I won't tell.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We'll go to the zoo sometime.
                        Okay? I think I might have some
                        time on my hands.
 
              Ray looks at Jerry's hands.
 
                                  RAY
                        I don't see any.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (points respectfully)
                        Funny.
 
                                  RAY
                        Funny...
                               (imitates him)
                               (hears mom
                                approaching)
                        I better go to bed.
 
              Ray hugs Jerry and exits.  Jerry sits contemplating the kid
              for a moment.  The door swings open and a harried Dorothy
              appears in the sexier top, but with a distinctly less sexy
              attitude, and a tray.


                                                                     77.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you
                        a cab.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (slightly confused)
                        Good idea.  Thank you.
 
              And we should keep our voices down a little.  I have a little
              boy asleep.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Right.  Of course.
 
              Jerry tries to twist open the beer, ripping at his palm. It's
              not a twist-off.  She hands him an opener.  He opens it,
              inelegantly.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        So.  Our company.
 
              She watches the drunken man, who drinks. Then coughs a
              little. Then stands.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay.  Lil' speech before I go.
 
              He gets up, woozy, but loose.  Powerfully:
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Do.  Not.  Worry.  About.  Your.
                        Job.
                               (beat)
                        Our company is in good shape. You
                        and your son... we... are just
                        fine.  You still have a job. I
                        want you to feel confident!  In.
                        Me.  And I have a problem with
                        people who talk about themselves
                        in the third person, but let me
                        tell you something about Jerry
                        Maguire.
 
              His confidence nicely fueled, Jerry reaches for a fireplace
              poker. He begins to joust with an imaginary opponent.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Come after me and you will lose I
                        am a survivor!  Do not
                        underestimate Jerry Maguire!  I've
                        got wits!
                                  (more)


                                                                     78.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        I've got the instincts of a
                        panther!
                               (joust)
                        I've got Dorothy Boyd on my side!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't worry about me.  I can get
                        jobs --
 
                                  JERRY
                        We will be fine!
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        -- especially one like this.
 
                                  JERRY
                        And I am...
 
              He becomes very aware of himself. Acting out in a virtual
              stranger's small-but-comfortable living room.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I am drunk.
 
              He collapses onto the sofa, embarrassed.  Shaking his head.
              Dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair.  She breaks the
              personal barrier, carefully touching his wound with the wet
              tip of the aloe vera plant.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Truth?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sure.
 
              Dorothy turns to see that Laurel's two shoes are still very
              visible at the kitchen door.  Decides to ignore them.  She
              gets closer.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sure, I care about the job.  Of
                        course.  But mostly...
                               (very honest)
                        ...  I want to be inspired.
 
              There is something inspiring about the way she says the word
              "inspiring."
 
                                  JERRY
                        Me too.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What you wrote inspired me.


                                                                     79.
 
 
              He is catching a scent of that most ancient elixer.  A
              woman's affection.  Their heads inch closer together.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I'm working with you because of
                        that memo...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Mission... statement...
 
              They kiss.  It turns rather passionate.  She places a cool
              hand on his cheek.   He places a hand on her breast.  The
              taxi beeps outside.  She pulls away.  Both regard the hand on
              her breast.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Well.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Sorry about this hand.
                               (he rises unsteadily)
                        You know that feeling -- you're
                        not completely embarrassed yet,
                        but you glimpe tomorrow's
                        embarrassment?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't worry about it, boss.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh shit.  You said "boss."
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Yeah, I did.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No.  No don't feel like Clarence
                        Thomas.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I do.  I feel like Clarence
                        Thomas.
                               (the worst day ever)
                        I'm like... harrassing you...
                        right now.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I may not sue.
 
              He laughs a little.  Music.  Unsure what more to say, Jerry
              rubs his face.  And then:


                                                                     80.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, good evening.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good evening.
 
              He stands, returns the fireplace poker to her, and exits.
              Stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the
              front porch, he recovers with style.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We'll be okay.  And I'm going to
                        take my... one client and we're
                        gonna go all the way.
 
              He takes a few more steps, re-balancing bags, coughs a
              little.  He is a mess, and he knows it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing; loving
                                the dark humor)
                        Hey. I'm back.
 
              She laughs, waves, and exits back into the kitchen.  She
              regards the poker still in her hand. Laurel watches her
              conflicted, slightly lovesick sister.
 
              INT. CAB -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry in the back of the cab.  He turns for a moment, looking
              back at the warm house he's just left. Something is
              scratching at his soul, trying to get in. Music continues. He
              was strangely comfortable there, as the house disappears from
              his view.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. TEMPE PRACTICE AREA -- DAY
 
              Rod Tidwell races to catch up to a wobbly, overthrown pass.
              He snags it out of the air, and moves gracefully downfield.
              He turns back to shout at the quarterback for the wobbly
              pass, and slams into a padding post.  Dennis Wilburn, the GM
              we met earlier, crosses in front of Maguire, giving him a
              look.  Maguire forges ahead anyway.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We gotta talk about his contract,
                        Dennis.
 
                                  WILBURN
                        Your timing is impeccable,
                        Maguire. Gee, I can't imagine how
                        you ever lost Cush...


                                                                     81.
 
 
              Wilburn moves on, scoffing loudly.
 
              INT. LOCKER ROOM SHOWER AREA -- DAY
 
              Jerry stands in pre-season locker-room.   Off-stage we hear
              a shower.  In the b.g., one of those locker-room psych-up
              signs like: Injuries happen first in the mind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I started talking with Dennis
                        Wilburn about your renegotation.
 
              Rod emerges naked, dripping wet, pissed.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Did you tell him about the "ten
                        million for four years?"
 
                                  JERRY
                        Uh, not today, but --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre
                        Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools,
                        and yet they're making the big
                        sweet dollars. They're making the
                        money, and I got an agent that
                        ain't even put the number on the
                        table.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I understand your anxiety.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Maybe you don't.  Because it's not
                        just the money I deserve.  It's
                        not just the "coin."  It's the...
 
              He says this next word royally, as if it's fine silk.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        --  the kwan.
 
                                  JERRY
                        That's your word?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Yeah, man, it means love, respect,
                        community... and the dollars too.
                        The package.  The kwan.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (impressed)
                        But how did you get "kwan?"


                                                                     82.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        I got there from "coin," dude.
                        Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Great word.  Towel?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No, I air-dry.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, I say this with great
                        respect, but those players you
                        mentioned are marquee players
                        and --
 
              A portable phone beeps.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Is that your porty or mine?
 
                                  JERRY
                        You.
 
              Tidwell rummages in his bag.  Finds one of two porties and
              answers the one with a Polaroid of Marcee taped to it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Hi baby. Yeah, I'm just breakin'
                        in the new agent.  He says I'm not
                        marquee.  I know... I know...
 
              Tidwell holds up the phone so Jerry can hear the sound of
              Marcee going off.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        My wife is upset with you.
 
              INT. LOCKER ROOM MIRROR -- DAY
 
              The conversation continues as Tidwell fixes hair in the
              mirror. Jerry  speaks  to  the  reflection,  taking  him  on,
              gesturing passionately.  Tidwell, still naked, may or may not
              be listening.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Here's what I'm saying.  This is
                        a renegotiation.  We want more
                        from them, so let's show them more
                        from us. Let's show them your pure
                        joy of the game, let's bury the
                        Attitude a little, let's show
                        them --


                                                                     83.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        You're telling me to dance.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm saying to be --
 
              He mimes a dainty little showboat-touchdown dance.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (little voice)
                        "Love me love me love me... put me
                        on t.v."
                               (pissed)
                        That's the iconography of rascism,
                        man!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm
                        telling you to be the best version
                        of you, to get back to the guy who
                        first started playing this game.
                        Way back when you were a kid.  It
                        wasn't just about the money, was
                        it?
 
              Tidwell gives him a look.  Money was always a factor.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Do your job, man, don't tell me to
                        dance.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Fine.
 
              He begins gathering his things.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm an athlete, not an
                        entertainer. These are the ABC's
                        of ME.  Get it? I don't dance.
 
              Jerry rubs face.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        What's wrong.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Forget it.  Forget it.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No tell me.


                                                                     84.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm out here for you!  You don't
                        know what it's like to be me out
                        here for you. It is an up-at-dawn
                        pride-swallowing seige that I will
                        never fully tell you about! Okay?!
                        Help me help you help me help you.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You're hanging by a very thin
                        thread, dude.  And I dig that
                        about you.
 
              Jerry has had enough for one day.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (loopy, punch-drunk,
                                arms flailing)
                        Hey.  I'm happy to entertain you!
                        I'll see you in L.A.!
 
              Tidwell watches his agent lurch off, muttering and swaying.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        See, man, that's the difference.
                        between us.  You think we're
                        fighting, I think we're finally
                        talking!
 
              INT. LAX AIRPORT -- DAY
 
              Jerry moves slowly through crowded airport, preoccupied with
              thought.
 
              INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
 
              Jerry enters, carrying bags, weary.  Dorothy greets him. They
              are stuck in his small condo, and the scent of their previous
              encounter is still in the air.  She hands him a list of his
              calls.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona
                        to say he's faxing in the new
                        Tidwell offer on Thursday morning,
                        and you'll be happy.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (jolted into
                                happiness)
                        Happy. He said "happy?"
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Actually he said "glad."


                                                                     85.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Plus, you could use that
                        commission.
 
              She hands him a financial report she's done.  He takes a
              quick look, seeing the thorough work she's already done.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I sunk most of what I had into
                        this condo, which devalued, and --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        You don't have to explain.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look, the other night, I want to
                        apologize.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (can't read her)
                        Yeah, what happened there.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We're two people working together
                        and we can't have an atmosphere.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'm relieved you said that.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I mean, the other night was... I
                        felt like you understood something
                        I could barely even say, something
                        way down deep in the murk --
                               (beat)
                        -- but we have a company here to
                        think about.  I won't ever take
                        advantage of you in that way again.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (evenly)
                        Oh good.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You walked out on a job for me,
                        and I won't ruin that.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Exactly because I know this is a
                        time when you need to be alone
                        with your thoughts.
                                  (more)


                                                                     86.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        Think about everything that's gone
                        wrong, how to fix them, and just
                        be... alone, alone, alone.
 
              Dorothy in the background of the shot, watching his reaction.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want to go out to dinner?
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
 
              Dorothy looks for a jacket as Laurel helms the Divorced
              Women's group in the living room.  Jan speaks through her
              whistly braces, gesturing with a too-full glass of red wine.
 
                                  JAN
                        I broke up with the Cowboy. And
                        now he's stalking me...
 
                                  ALICE
                        What's the current definition of
                        stalking?
 
                                  WOMAN # 1
                        Coming over uninvited.
 
                                  JAN
                               (thoughtful)
                        So Romeo under the trellis... was
                        a stalker.
 
              Meaningful sounds of revelation, as Dorothy finds the jacket.
 
              INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy stops in the hallway to see that Jerry Maguire has
              arrived at the back-kitchen door.  She watches unseen as
              Maguire shakes hands with Chad the Nanny and is hit suddenly
              by a flying hug from Ray.  He gives the kid an athletic bag,
              which is filled with state-of-the-art promotional athletic
              wear, etc. ("Brought you some swag.")  Ray continues hugging
              Jerry.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry is a little embarrassed by the affections of the kid.
              Dorothy enters.  Expertly breezy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Hey, looks like you've got a fan.


                                                                     87.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (outdressed)
                        Wow.  That's more than a dress.
                        That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Yeah -- guess I got revved up at
                        the idea of an evening among
                        adults -- no offense buster.
                               (then)
                        You meet Chad the nanny?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay?
                        I guess I didn't realize we were...
 
              He doesn't finish the words "going out on a date."  The
              cacaphony of the Boyd home swirls around Maguire.  It's a new
              sensation for this bachelor.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Don't let him stay up too late.
 
                                  CHAD
                               (grandly)
                        Hey, man, tonight I'm going to
                        teach Ray about jazz.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good, that'll put him to sleep
                        early. No offense.
 
              She twirls toward the door, grabbing her purse.
 
                                  CHAD
                        You know, you people have a jazz
                        problem in this house.
 
              Laurel enters, adding to the chaos, adlibbing hellos.
 
                                  RAY
                        I wanna go too.
 
              Laurel gives Ray a look.  Ray backs down, as Jerry hears
              snatches of the Women's group going full blast in the living
              room.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Bye you guys.


                                                                     88.
 
 
              Ray extends his arms, he wants a hug.  Jerry bends down
              awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's
              cheek.  All are surprised, especially Jerry.  Dorothy is
              struck and moved.  Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit
              with wonder. Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees
              one.
 
              INT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT
 
              Laurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting. She
              is equal parts jealous and protective.  She spots keys on
              counter. She grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on
              the lawn. "All Shook Down."  Replacements.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see
              are parked on the street and the front lawn.  The sound of
              the Women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind
              them.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Hey!
 
              As Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can
              have privacy with her sister.
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (continuing)
                        Forgot your keys --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (privately)
                        That's the first time I ever saw
                        him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't
                        that just... thrilling?
                               (eyes tear up)
                        I mean, he must have been needing
                        that.
 
              Women's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to
              glue her emotional sister back together.  She holds her arm.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        No no.  Don't cry at the beginning
                        of the date.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (laughing, wiping
                                tear)
                        Oh, knock it off!


                                                                     89.
 
 
                                  LAUREL
                               (can't help it)
                        And don't be a shoulder for him to
                        cry on either.
 
              We stay with Laurel as she watches her sister exit.   Music
              continues.  Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young
              girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood,
              slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the
              street.
 
              INT. ANTONIO'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy sit at the table of this Mexican
              restaurant. In the background, Mariachis play.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It was laziness1 my whole breakup
                        with Avery. You know that thing
                        you say, "it's nobody's fault."
                        It's one of the great lies, right?
                        Someone is always to blame -- if
                        you go for it, go for it like you
                        do a job, work at it --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Maybe love shouldn't be such hard
                        work. I know, but --
 
              Mariachis approach the table.
 
                                  HEAD MARIACHI
                        A song for the lovers?
 
                                  JERRY/DOROTHY
                               (too quickly)
                        No.  No thanks.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        We work together.
 
              Jerry slips the guy a few bucks to go away. They do so,
              reluctantly.
 
                                  JERRY
                        See, you choose. If you fall for
                        someone, if you make a commitment,
                        you should make it work.  It's
                        only when "options" entered the
                        picture that things got bad. I'm
                        speaking historically now.  It's
                        a modern day concept,
                        nueroticism -- how do I feeeeeel?
                        -- I think the only good thing to
                                  (more)


                                                                     90.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                        come from this period in history
                        is probably the movie "Annie Hall."
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (evenly)
                        Maybe you should call her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No no no.  I just underestimated
                        her...
                               (touches wound)
                        her temper, I guess.  Why are we
                        even talking about this?
 
              A FLOWER GIRL approaches the table with an armful of roses.
 
                                  FLOWER GIRL
                        A rose for the lady.
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want a --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        (   (scoffs)
                        No.  No way.
 
              Jerry gives her few bucks, she exits.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage
                        to Roger was so great, even
                        before --
                               (stops herself)
                        Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (simply)
                        Let's not tell our sad stories.
 
              Jerry laughs to himself. He admires her directness.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I'll be right back. Quit thinking
                        those murky thoughts, okay? We're
                        young, we're semi-successful. Life
                        is good.
 
              She exits and we hang on him for a moment.


                                                                     91.
 
 
              INT. BATHROOM -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER
 
              Dorothy on the phone outside the bathroom.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No, now... come on... let Chad
                        catch the bee in a glass.  He
                        won't hurt it. Aw, buddy, you got
                        such a good heart. I love you,
                        I'll be home soon.  Can't wait to
                        see you.
 
              EXT. BATHROOM
 
              Sbe exits the bathroom and stops at the sight of what is
              happening at the table. Jerry, hand on face, is
              embarrassingly being serenaded by the Mariachis, who now play
              a mournful "Tears in Heaven."  She smiles at the image, in
              fact the poetry charms her. Dorothy moves forward, grinning,
              fishes some bucks out of her pocket, and sends the Mariachis
              in another direction.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Come on, let's take a walk.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Music feathers into sounds of night.  A bug buzzing from the
              nearby light, Jerry swats it away.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well -- this would be goodnight.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good night.
 
              They don't kiss.  They take great care not to touch too much.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll see you tomorrow.
 
              They don't move. On impulse, she grabs him and pulls him
              close. Kisses him.  It's a good one.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Good night.
 
              But they don't move.  He pulls her closer by her straps.
              They break.  She holds them up, nervous now. His lips travel
              down. He kisses her upper chest. She sighs deeply, she's
              missed this feeling.  Jerry rises to kiss her lips again,
              tying her straps back on. Her expression says there is a
              decision to make. She concentrates on the styrofoam container
              she's brought back from the restaurant.


                                                                     92.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing; breath)
                        I think you should not come in, or
                        come in depending on how you feel.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Same to you.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Right.  I'll come in.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Okay. Wait here a second.
                               (beat, then)
                        Do we really want to do this?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (half-unsure)
                        Oh hell yes.
 
              She exits, as shot lingers on Jerry.  That odd moment when
              you've crossed the line.  He takes a breath.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Dorothy enters to find Chad watching t.v.  The house is now
              quiet, the remains of the Divorced Women's group is still in
              evidence.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        He's asleep, right?
 
                                  CHAD
                        Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Still going.
 
              Chad raises his eyebrows.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Shhh.
 
              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry on the porch, as Chad exits.  Chad now fully plays the
              part of friend with seniority.  Looks the taller Jerry up and
              down.
 
                                  CHAD
                        Treat her right, man.  She's...


                                                                     93.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (self-conscious)
                        Yeah... well...
 
                                  CHAD
                        She's great.  And I know this is
                        a little awkward, but I want you
                        to use this.
 
              Chad ruumages in bag for a moment.  Jerry is somewhat
              horrified at what Chad might be giving him.  Out comes a
              cassette tape.
 
                                  CHAD
                               (continuing; intense)
                        This... is Miles Davis and John
                        Coltrane. Stockholm.  1963... two
                        masters of freedom, playing in a
                        time before their art was
                        corrupted by a zillion cocktail
                        lounge performers who destroyed
                        the legacy of the only American
                        artform -- JAZZ.
 
              Jerry takes the tape, as the front door squeaks open.
              Dorothy shoos Chad away, quietly leads Jerry inside.
 
              INT. BEDROOM-- NIGHT
 
              Fierce, driving jazz. Dorothy and Jerry making out on bed.
              Getting hotter. The music gets wilder. Finally it is
              impossible to ignore, and Jerry collapses backwards on the
              bed laughing.  She is left frozen, her arms open but he is
              gone.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What is this MUSIC?
 
              They both crack up, and she kisses him as the music plays. He
              looks at her. She turns away, then back again, he's still
              looking at her. It's a powerful moment for her.  Laughter
              continues, the music is ridiculous. (Their sex is a big
              difference from the let's-be-intense sex with Avery.)
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- SAME TIME
 
              Laurel just home from work in nurse uniform, has a late-night
              joint and carefully blows the smoke out the window.  Laughter
              from the next room.  She pops open the styrofoam appetizers
              her sister brought back from dinner.
 
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

              INT. DOROTHY'S BEDROOM -- MORNING
 
              Radio clicks on.  It's still dark.  Only the glow of the
              digital lamp.  Jerry alone in bed.  He gets up, coughs, pulls
              on some pants.  Manuevers through a strange bedroom, steps on
              toys.
 
              INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
 
              Dorothy and Laurel in the kitchen, waiting far the first
              possible drops of coffee.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I'm getting him up, don't worry.'
                        Ray will never see his mother's
                        raging physical needs.
 
              She starts to exit, but Laurel pulls her back far a second.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        First you gotta tell me something.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No--
 
              INT. HALLWAY -- MORNING
 
              Jerry moving dawn the hallway, hears voices.

                        Because I'm worried that you're
                        putting your faith in this guy
                        who, because of the way things are
                        going, may not have an emotional
                        marble in his head.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Please, if I start talking --

              ON JERRY
 
              listening.  Pinned to the wall, listening to the kind of
              honesty an agent rarely hears.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        ... so what am I, for taking the
                        opportunity, Laurel?
                                  (more)

                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        Maybe I am taking advantage.  Am
                        I a bad person? All I know is that
                        I found someone who was charming
                        and popular and not-so-nice to
                        me -- and he died.  Okay?  So why
                        should I let this guy go, when
                        everything in my body says This
                        One is The One.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        Easy, hon, I was just looking for
                        fun details --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
                        And oh, I don't know if you're
                        interested in this detail, but I
                        was just about to tell you that I
                        love him.  I love him, and I don't
                        care what you think.  I love him
                        for the guy he wants to be, and I
                        love him for the guy he almost is.
                        I love him.
 
              They look at each other. The cat is way, way out of the bag.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              rubbing his face.
 
                                  RAY
                        Hi Jerry!
 
              Dorothy leans into the hallway now, sees Jerry standing
              there, well within earshot.  As Ray pounds down the hallway
              in his new over-sized shirt, brought by Jerry, Dorothy begins
              to crumble. The lack of control in her life is overwhelming
              her.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh God.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Easy, easy --
 
              Jerry enters the kitchen, stands near Laurel.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I could pretend I didn't hear, but
                        I won't, I heard everything.
                               (to Laurel)
                        Thank you for your honesty, as
                        always.


                                                                     96.

                               (frozen polite)
                        Coffee, Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Oh, no thanks.  We bottom-feeders
                        prefer cereal first --
 
                                  RAY
                        Let's have Apple Jacks!
 
              Apple Jacks it is.  Dorothy, good morning, darling. He kisses
              her on the cheek, in full view of Ray.  Dorothy, still
              embarrassed, not sure what is going on, reaches for cereal.
              Jerry sits down for breakfast.  They are an odd, but fairly
              complete-looking family.
 
                                  RAY
                               (continuing)
                        What's going on, Jerry?
 
                                  JERRY
                        A lot.  We got a big fax today...
                        we need this commission, buddy.
 
              The sisters look at each other.  Ray looks around, he feels
              happy, but there is something else in the room.  He shrugs
              and continues to feel happy.
 
              INT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATER DAY
 
              Jerry and Dorothy prepare for the Tidwells, cleaning up the
              cramped office, unstacking chairs and making room.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        That was great of you this morning.
 
              The Tidwells honk, arriving in the driveway.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (friendly, dismissive)
                        Look, let's just root for a big
                        offer so we can move out of this
                        room to a real office.
 
              She feels slightly slapped down, but covers.  She opens a
              window quickly, and busies herself with the clutter at hand.
 
              ON FAX
 
              Connecting.

              FOUR FACES
 
              waiting for the results.  Everybody has a stake in this fax.
              Lives are very clearly hanging on this results.  Marcee shuts
              her eyes.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Read it to me, and don't say
                        anything unless it's over nine.
 
              There is a stunning disappointment on the fax.  Jerry's heart
              sinks.  His face slackens.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Aw shit --
 
              Rod turns away.  Dorothy shuts her eyes, as Marcee opens hers.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        One-point-seven for three years.
                        That's below average.  We owe more
                        than that...
 
              It is so very painful for her, as Tidwell slinks off to sit
              in a seat too small for him.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll go back to them.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (explodes)
                        And say what?  "Please remove your
                        dick from my ass?!"
 
              Both men look at her. The outburst has surprised even Marcee.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        I'm sorry.  I'm a little pregnant
                        right now.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I feel like crying.  I feel like
                        breaking the room up.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Okay, we don't take this
                        emotionally. We roll with this
                        problem.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What are you talking about --
                        "don't get emotional." If you ask
                        me, you haven't gotten emotional
                        ENOUGH about this man.

                        What DO you stand for???
 
              Dorothy looks right and left, can't hold back.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        How about a little piece of
                        integrity in this world that is so
                        filled with greed and a lack of
                        honorability that I don't know
                        what to tell my kid except take a
                        look at a guy who isn't shouting
                        "show me the money," he's quietly
                        broke and working for you for free!
                               (off Jerry's pained
                                look)
                        Well, I'm sorry, I'm not as good
                        at the insults as she is.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        No, that was pretty good.

                               (impressed)
                        No shit.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        In fact, you should read something
                        that meant the world to me...
 
              She opens a drawer, and withdraws the Mission Statement. She
              is headed across the room to give it to Marcee, when Jerry
              swiftly intercepts it.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Another time, okay Dorothy?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Fine, I just --
 
                                  JERRY
                        And I appreciate that impulse.
 
              Jerry throws the Mission Statement into a bottom drawer.
              Camera moves to Tidwell, and we see him for the first time
              without his protective shield of attitude.  Scared.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Tell me what to do, Jerry.  You
                        tell me to eat lima beans, I'll
                        eat lima beans.

                                                                     99.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL (cont'd)
                        If you say take the shitty deal,
                        that's all we can get --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        "All we can get?"
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Can I SPEAK with my agent here?
 
              Marcee is passionate.  Focused on Rod.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        You know what you're qonna do,
                        Rodney. You're gonna reject this
                        shitty contract. You're gonna play
                        out your existihg shitty contract
                        and go be a free agent next year
                        and the hell with Arizona. This is
                        us, and we determine our worth.
                        You're a fine, proud, surviving,
                        splendid black man.
 
              Beat.  Truer words...  The big man looks into his wife's eyes.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Honey, you are just --
 
              No one else in the world exists.  They are focused totally on
              each other.  Jerry and Dorothy in the background, just
              watching the intricate machinery of this marriage.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        -- the shit.
 
              She caresses the back of his neck.  He pulls her to him.  He
              gives her a small kiss.  Dorothy and Jerry look at the
              couple, fascinated and somewhat uncomfortable.  There is a
              palpable forcefield around the Tidwells.  They are a couple
              in every passionate sense of the word.  After a beat:
 
                                  JERRY
                        If you get injured, you get
                        nothing.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Won't happen.  I'm strong in my
                        mind.
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's a risk.
 
              Jerry looks over to Dorothy, who grits her teeth at the
              implications of the decision.


                                                                     100.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Bet on me, dude.  Bet on me like
                        I bet on you.
 
              Tidwell puts his hand out.  Maguire is conflicted, but he
              takes a breath and shakes.
 
              EXT. JERRY'S HOME OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON
 
              Tidwell and Marcee exit.  Dorothy and Jerry on the lawn.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll get you some quick work --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Good deal, man.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        I'm sorry what I said back there.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't be silly.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        My husband believes in you.  We're
                        gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Take care you guys.
 
              Tidwells exit.  Finally, Dorothy and Jerry are alone.  The
              Tidwell situation has left an ominious feeling in the air.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        Look...  I was up for a job in San
                        Diego before I left SMI. It's with
                        the Chargers.
 
              AIRPLANE WHEELS
 
              touching down.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't even talk about that yet.
                        I'll find something fast for
                        Tidwell. We'll stay afloat.
 
              EXT. COMMERCIAL SET/TAYLOR CHEVROLET/ARIZONA -- DAY
 
              Tidwell stands on the set of a regional Arizona car
              commercial. It is a hot day.  Three other bored, large
              Arizona athletes wait by a coffee machine, as Jerry's friend,
              director Bill Dooler appears ready to implode.  Dooler is
              arguing with Tidwell.


                                                                     101.
 
 
              Maguire stands slightly away, acting as referee.  Nearby, a
              camel.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Bill, Rod, wait --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Dude, know your art form.  If you
                        put the camera down here, looking
                        up, I look more powerful.  There's
                        no need for a camel... you got ME.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Rod, get on the camel.
 
                                  DOOLER
                               (shoots look to Jerry)
                        The sponsor wants a camel --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Jerry, back me up.  It's either
                        the camel or me...
 
              Tidwell waves his arms, spooking the camel, who spits and
              stormps. Several crew members scatter in various directions.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (takes the bullet)
                        Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him
                        out of this.  This isn't what I
                        had in mind anyway.
 
                                  DOOLER
                        Then you shouldn't have begged me
                        to hire him.
 
              EXT. SET -- LATER
 
              Jerry and Tidwell walk quickly from the set.  In the
              background, another athlete rides the camel.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        There you go, dude.  You're
                        learning how to represent me.  We
                        ain't gonna bring Nike to their
                        knees with some regional camel
                        ad --
 
              Jerry rubs his face.


                                                                     102.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Can I ask you a question totally
                        unrelated to your career?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh, we gonna be friends now?
 
                                  JERRY
                        What do you know about dating a
                        single mother?
 
              Tidwell warms to the personal question.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by
                        a single mother.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tell me, because it's been a
                        month, and she's about to take
                        another job in San Diego.
 
              Tidwell is always happy to hold forth.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        First, single mothers don't
                        "date." They have been to the
                        circus, you know what I'm saying?
                        They have been to the puppet show
                        and they have seen the strings.
                        You love her?
 
                                  JERRY
                        How do I know?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You know when you know.  It makes
                        you shivver, it eats at your
                        insides. You know?
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I don't know.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Then you gotta have The Talk.
 
                                  JERRY
                        But I sure don't like that she's
                        leaving.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, that ain't fair to her.  A
                        single mother, that's a sacred
                        thing, man.


                                                                     103.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        The kid is amazing.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (shaking head)
                        No.  A real man does not shoplift
                        the "pooty" from a single mom.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We
                        were thrown together and -- I mean
                        it's two mutual people who --
                               (a look)
                        Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
 
              INT. ZOO -- DAY
 
              Jerry, Dorothy and Ray at the zoo.  Ray straining at Jerry's
              arm. Life-changing decisions in the air.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        They offered me everything I asked
                        for, it's only 2 hours away. I
                        think it's good for us.
 
              Jerry feels tugged in many directions, and not just by Ray.
              They approach the reptile house.
 
                                  RAY
                        Show me the animal, Jerry!
 
                                  JERRY
                        Right up ahead, buddy --
 
              They approach the Reptile House, where a small crowd is
              gathered.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        -- I give you my favorite animal
                        in the zoo.  Are you ready for the
                        weirdness, the strange perfection
                        and truth of...
 
                                  RAY
                        I'm scared.  What is it?
 
                                  JERRY
                        It's in a cage.  Do not be scared
                        of...
 
              A few people peel away, revealing...


                                                                     104.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        The Two-Headed Corn Snake.
 
              THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE
 
              A friendly but confused looking reptile.  The snake has two
              heads, both identical, both twisting and battling each other
              for direction.  Aw-ed chatter around the animal ranges from
              "weird" and "wow" to "mira mira!  Dos cabezas!"  Few can turn
              away.
 
                                  RAY
                        Whoa.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (quietly)
                        Two heads.  My God...
 
              Jerry is happy to play tour-guide.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Both heads have brains.  Both
                        heads eat, both heads battle for
                        direction all day long.
                               (meaningful)
                        Man, can I relate.
 
              The odd animal moves forward, fighting itself constantly.
 
                                  RAY
                        Me too.
 
              Dorothy just looks at the two men in her life.  She turns to
              Anonymous Man standing nearby, staring at the animal.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Is this a guy thing?
 
                                  ANONYMOUS MAN
                        It is, and it isn't.
 
              ON THE TWO-HEADED CORN SNAKE
 
              strangely endearing, jittering and moving around the cage.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S FRONT YARD -- DAY
 
              A U-Haul is parked in the driveway.  Inside the cab, a very
              sad Ray.  Jerry approaches carefully.  Ray does not look at
              him.  He opens the door, scoots the kid over, and sits next
              to him.


                                                                     105.
 
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY
 
              Laurel and Dorothy say goodbye.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        You're doing the right thing. I
                        mean, come on.  You need to start
                        your life and he... he needs a
                        warm body to cushion the fall.

              POV -- THE SISTERS
 
              We see Jerry, following Chad back to the house, saying
              goodbye too many times. He's anxious not to be left alone.
              Finally Chad grabs him by the shoulders, says goodbye, as a
              sad Ray trudges to the cab of the U-Haul.  Jerry now follows
              Ray to the car.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S PLACE -- DAY
 
              Jerry scoots a very sad Ray over, and talks to him in the car.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm not good at this.
 
              Ray begins to cry. Jerry is incapable of dealing with it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I'll see you this weekend, okay?
                        Promise.
 
              Ray wails.  Jerry squeezes his shoulder, it does nothing, so
              he exits. He rises and faces Dorothy, keys in hand.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Sure you're okay to drive this?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        This rig? Phht.  No problem.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So I'll see you this weekend.
 
              She accepts it casually, with a shrug.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Airight, so goodbye and --
                               (simple, with shrug)
                        I love you.
 
              Jerry blinks.


                                                                     106.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                               (too quick, weirdly)
                        ... I love you too, you know.
 
              She reacts with an odd look.  The words don't sound right,
              and he knows that she knows.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        What --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Look, just in case this weekend
                        becomes next month and next month
                        becomes... whatever...
                               (beat)
                        Don't make a joke of your life.
                        Go back and read what you wrote.
                        You're better than the rest of
                        them, better than the Bob Sugars,
                        and don't forget it.
 
              He shudders a little with the intimacy of her words.  She
              kisses him, and moves quickly toward the car, leaving him
              alone in frame. He grows increasingly uncomfortable.  He
              watches her leave.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Wait a second.
 
              ON DOROTHY
 
              moving to her car.  She hears him.  It's not loud enough for
              her.
 
                                  JERRY
                        WAIT A SECOND!
 
              She stops, smiling very slightly to herself , biting her lip.
              She turns and he is now close to her.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I know a way to s... to save on
                        Medical and rent and... look...
 
              He grips one hand with the other.  Dorothy looks at his
              strange behavior.  He looks over to the cab, where Ray is
              making a sad face at him through the window.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        ...  what if we stayed together?
                        What if we uh... got married.


                                                                     107.
 
 
              She looks at him.  It's an odd proposal.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        If I said that, would you stay?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say
                        that if you don't...
 
                                  JERRY
                        Will you marry me?
 
              She looks at him, full of love, dabbing at her mascara.
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S BACKYARD -- DAY
 
              Rod Tidwell sings Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On" at the
              wedding for assorted guests gathered here in the backyard.
              Contrary to his own belief, Rod is not a gifted singer.  In
              the wedding band, standing on a small stage in the corner,
              are Chad and Dooler.
 
              ON JERRY
 
              who stands watching, smile pasted on, with stoic FATHER and
              well-dressed BROTHER.
 
                                  BROTHER
                        Where are all your friends?
 
                                  JERRY
                               (looking around)
                        In the band.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              We are close on Ray now as we hear the sound of a Reverend
              reading wedding vows.  Ray holds the ring, and waits for his
              cue to offer it.  But he has forgotten the cue.  And every
              time the Reverend pauses, he starts to offer the ring.
 
              Dorothy's leg and hand are visible in frame.  She calms him
              with a hand on the shoulder.  And finally the cue comes and
              he offers the ring.
 
              INT. DOROTHY'S HALLWAY/KITCHEN -- NIGHT
 
              The bride and groom catch each other, post-wedding, in the
              hallway of the small home where the event has taken place.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Wow.  We actually --


                                                                     108.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        Yeah, we did.
 
              Giddy, Dorothy heads into the living room where Friends and
              relatives watch the video of the wedding. And now the
              enormity is evident on Jerry's face. Warm laughter in the
              b.g.  More laughter and family noise in the background now.
              He holds onto a table for a moment, steadies himself.  Jerry
              takes a breath and moves into the kitchen.  Finds a beer.  He
              turns and finds himself alone with Laurel, for the first
              time.  She raises her beer.  They toast, warily.
 
                                  LAUREL
                        If you fuck this up, I'll kill you.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (as she exits)
                        Glad we had this talk!
 
              Nearby, Tidwell watches all.  He moves to Jerry.
              Confidentially:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You never had The Talk, did you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        No.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Well, this was another way to go.
 
              Jerry smiles.  Dorothy brings Jerry a Poloraid someone took,
              and for a moment the couple stands awkwardly together.
              Tidwell rubs Jerry's shoulders a little, announcing to the
              room:
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        This is my agent, man!  And we're
                        all gonna have a great season!
 
              He pounds Jerry on the back, hard, shaking him like a pinata.
 
                                                       FADE TO
 
              EXT. PHILADELPHIA PLAYING FIELD -- DAY
 
              Tidwell catches the ball, takes a vicious hit. The season is
              on.
 
              INT. PHILADELPHIA PRESS BOX -- DAY
 
              Across the room, he sees GM Dennis Wilburn standing with
              Avery.


                                                                     109.
 
 
              He turns away, passing a monitor where elsewhere in the
              country, Frank Cushman is having another sensational Sunday.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM/PHOENIX -- DAY
 
              This is the Tidwell family ritual of watching Rod's games on
              the big-screen home t.v.  At the center is Marcee Tidwell.
              Everything flows from her.  Next to her is Tyson, and then
              the cousins, the neighborhood friends.  At this particular
              moment, they are all screaming for Rod, who is taking a
              beating, but is having a hell of a game.  In front of the
              t.v., Tyson does the "Daddy Dance," a dance of pure joy.
 
                                  TYSON
                               (proudly, to family)
                        That's my motherfucker!
 
              Marcee reaches out and collars her dancing son.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Why don't you be the first man in
                        your family not to say that word?
                        And then we'll let you live.
 
              Tyson nods, wide-eyed.
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (continuing)
                        Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                               (cooly)
                        That's why they cheer, you know.
                        The white man sending the black
                        man into battle...
 
              Marcee shoots him a look, as Tidwell takes another rough hit.
 
              INT. STADIUM HALLWAY -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry stands waiting.  Bob Sugar nearby, greeting quarterback
              JOHN SWENSON.  Still no Tidwell.
 
              EXT. PHILADELPHIA LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Finally, here comes Tidwell, moving very slowly with garmet
              bag.
 
                                  JERRY
                        How's your head? Bubblicious.


                                                                     110.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Tidwell moves to a tan in a
                        wheelchair, signs an autograph and
                        moves on.  Jerry alongside. The
                        quarterback sucks, man.  He's
                        gonna get me killed.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'm a little worried --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm worried too.  I'm worried that
                        the only reason I'm here getting
                        my brains blown loose is that you
                        weren't asshole enough to get my
                        ten million three months ago.
 
                                  INSANE FAN
                               (interrupting loudly)
                        FUCKIN ROD TIDWELL YOU RULE YOU
                        RULE!  I WON A FUCKIN, A FUCKIN
                        MUG ON YOU IN MY ROTISS...
                        ROTLISS...
 
              With great skill, Tidwell pats the fan and moves him along to
              other tired players.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Peace, my drunken brother.  Ahd
                        don't discuss gambling with me.
 
              Insane fan moves to another player.  Jerry proceeds carefully.
 
                                  JERRY
                        We can still take the offer, Rod.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (stops)
                        No.
 
              Jerry regards his slightly befuddled friend.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, just stay healthy. I will
                        show you the kwan.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        Hey, that's my word, okay?
 
              Tidwell wearily heads for the bus.  Jerry stands in the
              parking lot.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I'll see you in Arizona.


                                                                     111.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm gonna have the game of my life
                        on Monday Night Football, and show
                        all these motherfuckers.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Take care, okay? You're my entire
                        client roster.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Don't I know.  Now go home to your
                        wife.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What's that supposed to mean?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Why are you even here, man? You
                        could have told me all this over
                        the phone.
 
                                  JERRY
                        I don't know -- how's "dedication"
                        for an answer?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        You don't want to go home, do you?
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm asking you a question --
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, you're --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm trying to talk to you.  How's
                        your marriage?
 
              Jerry looks at Rod for a moment.  It is the simplest
              question, and one in which he has no quick answer.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Not everyone has what you have.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Then why'd you get married?  I'm
                        asking you as a friend.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (shaking his head)
                        You're jabbing at me.


                                                                     112.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I'm sorry I asked.
 
                                  JERRY
                        No, I'm going to answer you.  You
                        want an answer?  I'll give it to
                        you.
                               (beat)
                        Loyalty.  She was loyal.
                               (unconvincing)
                        Everything grew from there.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        That's an answer.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Damn right.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (jab)
                        For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For
                        love, you get married.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Look.  I'm happy to entertain you,
                        as always, but I have a question
                        for you.  Are we really "friends?"
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Why not --
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, friends can tell each other
                        anything, right? If we have our
                        "friends" hats on --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (wary)
                        I think so.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (intense)
                        Airight.  Here's why you don't
                        have your ten million dollars yet.
                        You are a paycheck player.  You
                        play with your head.  Not your
                        heart.  In your personal life?
                               (points)
                        Heart. But when you get on the
                        field --

                                                                     113.
 
 
                                  JERRY (cont'd)
                               (finger rises to
                                Tidwell's head)
                        -- you're a businessman.  It's
                        wide-angle lenses and who fucked
                        you over and who owes you for it.
                        That's not what inspires people.
                        I'm sorry, but that's the truth,
                        can you handle it? Just a
                        "question," Rod.  Between friends.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I don't want to be friends anymore.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Fine.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Beautiful.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (angry)
                        We still having dinner in L.A.?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (anqry)
                        Only 'cause my wife likes your
                        wife!
 
              Jerry exits.  Tidwell is pissed.  And hurt.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        "No heart."  "No heart?"
                               (yells after him)
                        I'm all heart, motherfucker!
 
              He gets on the bus.
 
              INT. CRAB RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
 
              The Tidwells and the Maguires.  Tyson and Ray run around the
              table of this family-style restaurant. Marcee is very very
              pregnant. They crack crabs for each other, seasoning for each
              other, feeding each other like one many-armed and loving body.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        -- so I go to see a so-called
                        "black" film the other day --
                               (then)
                        -- honey, no more salt for you, I
                        don't want you dehydrated for
                        Monday Night Football.  Most
                        important game of your career.

                                  MARCEE (cont'd)
                               (then)
                        -- TWENTY minutes of coming
                        attractions. All black films, all
                        violent, I'm talking about
                        brothers shooting brothers, Wesley
                        Snipes with guns the size of our
                        house, killing, blood flowing,
                        cars crashing... blood blood blood
                        blood. Is this all they think we
                        want to see? Come on!  I enjoyed
                        Shindler's List.  Give me a little
                        credit, I mean hooo --
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        I hate you going to movies alone
                        withoutme --
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Oh baby --
 
              He cracks more crab, gives her the biggest piece.
 
              SHOT OF JERRY AND DOROTHY
 
              Sitting across the table, stunned, just watching this
              intricate and perfect marriage.
 
              SHOT OF MARCEE
 
              She takes a breath and gets a weird look.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        What baby?
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Baby.  Baby.  Baby...
 
              INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Marcee gives birth, Rod assisting.  Jerry and Dorothy watch
              from behind thick glass.  She hangs her arm on his shoulder,
              looks at him.  Jerry stares straight ahead. Mortified, with
              dry throat.
 
              INT. DOROTHY AND JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry and Dorothy exhausted, alone, getting ready for bed.
              Dorothy sits down near him on the bed.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        What were you thinking tonight?
                        Watching them go through the
                        complete human emotional
                        experience?


                                                                     115.
 
 
                                  JERRY
                        I was thinking I hope he doesn't
                        get injured. I felt responsible.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Sometimes I can't tell at all,
                        what's going through that head of
                        yours.
 
              He makes a noise. As in -- it's no big mystery.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        And I really don't know your
                        noises yet.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Well, when you wonder, ask me.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (unsatisfied)
                        Okay... I will...
 
              Beat.  He feels inadequate.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Why do you love me?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Why do you love me?
 
              It is, of course, the better question.  And before he can
              answer, there is a pounding at the door.
 
                                  RAY
                        Jerry, can I come in and watch
                        t.v.?
 
                           DOROTHY                       JERRY
                   I'll come visit you in a      Just for a few minutes,
                   second --                     buddy --
 
              The door flies open and Ray comes bounding in, onto the bed,
              stations himself in the center and begins wrestling Jerry for
              the remote control.  Dorothy watches, disconnected.  A
              steeliness comes over her that we have not yet seen.
 
              INT. PRESCHOOL -- NEXT DAY
 
              Dorothy drops Ray at preschool, and stands in the doorway of
              the playroom.  She watches the boys and girls playing
              together in a room full of bright colors and games.  Music.
              Anxiety building.

              EXT. RAY'S PLAYHOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry sits finishing a phone call to an advertising account
              exec. He has come here, to Ray's playhouse for privacy.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Tonight.  Yeah, the red-eye, I'll
                        be in Arizona on Monday...
 
              Jerry adlibs some salesmanship on Tidwell's behalf.   Dorothy
              approaches.  She gives him a few phone messages, sits down.
              Beat of silence.  He sees a look on her face that is
              unfamiliar.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's my fault.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        It's not fair to you.  This
                        whole --
 
                                  JERRY
                               (instant crisis mode)
                        Tell me -- let me help --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I took advantage of you and worst
                        of all, I'm not alone. I did this
                        with a kid.  I was just on some
                        ride where I thought I was in 1ove
                        enough for both of us.  I did
                        this.  And at least I can do
                        something about it now.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (damage control)
                        Well -- I'm not the guy who's
                        going to run.  I stick.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I don't need you to "stick."
 
                                  JERRY
                        You want...
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I don't know --
 
                                  JERRY
                               (it slips out)
                        ...my soul or something.


                                                                     117.
 
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (direct)
                        Dorothy -- what if I'm just not
                        built that way?
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I think we made a mistake here.
 
              But now he can't stop.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What if it's true?  "Great at
                        friendship bad at intimacy." I
                        mean, come on.  It's the theme of
                        my bachelor film --
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        I know.  I watched it.  I sort of
                        know it by heart.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (absorbs it)
                        I don't like to give up.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Oh please.  My need to make the
                        best of things, and your need to
                        be what, "responsible"... if one
                        of us doesn't say something now we
                        might lose ten years being polite
                        about it. Why don't we call this
                        next road trip what it is.  A nice
                        long break.
 
                                  JERRY
                        What about Ray?
 
              She notes the only real glimpse of ache, in that question.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        There's no question you'll be
                        friends. Of course you'll be
                        friends.
 
                                  JERRY
                        So this break... is a break-up.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Come on, Jerry.  You know this
                        isn't easy for me.

                                  DOROTHY (cont'd)
                        I mean, on the surface, you'd
                        almost think everything was fine.
                        See, I've got this great guy who
                        loves my kid --
                               (resolute, no tears)
                        -- and he sure does like me a lot.
 
              Jerry Maguire, a man who speaks for a living, has nothing to
              say.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        I can't live that way.  It's not
                        the way I'm "built."
 
              He moves to embrace her.  She pulls away first.
 
              INT. RAY'S ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry kisses sleepy Ray goodbye.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Don't wake up...
 
              And then faces the exotic fish who now resides on Ray's
              table.  He once lived in a tank the size of a Cadillac.  The
              fish now hangs in a too-small bowl, looking at him.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing;
                                defensive)
                        ...  it was just a Mission
                        Statement...
 
              INT. AIRPORT --  DAY
 
              Jerry Maguire stretches his arms out.  A security wand passes
              over him.  Deadness in his eyes. The glaze of the road on
              him.  Music.
 
              EXT. SUN DEVIL STADIUM -- ARIZONA
 
              We are hovering in the sky, just above Sun Devil Stadium.
 
              The classic Monday Night Football shot from the blimp.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Tidwell's family in the living room.  A buzz in the air.  The
              pregame show is on, sound-muted. Old-school on the stereo.
              Everybody is happy.  Marcee sits in the position of honor,
              her new baby KAYDEE in her arms.   She is a tired mother, and
              the family celebrates her.


                                                                     119.
 
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He'd better not mess up on Monday
                        Night Football.
 
              Marcee shoots Tee Pee a look.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                               (continuing)
                        What did I say?  He gets nervous
                        for the t.v. games... it's not a
                        secret.
 
              INT. TUNNEL AREA/PRE-GAME -- NIGHT
 
              Nervous Tidwell chews a toothpick as he stands checking out
              the field.  Nearby, some cheerleaders and a man in a Pickle
              suit.
 
                                  PICKLE MAN
                        Nothing like Monday Night, huh?
                        What is it, 2 billion viewers?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (irritated)
                        Shouldn't you be out there doing
                        some pickle dance or something --
                        Pickle Man nods and goes out to
                        dance for the crowd.
 
                                  VOICE
                        Hey Rod -- hey Buddydude --
 
              Tidwell turns.  It's Bob Sugar approaching. Laser-like, ready
              to feed on his insecurity.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Listen, I spoke to your
                        quarterback. He's my client, you
                        know.  And I said, "take care to
                        get those passes down, let Tidwell
                        look good on t.v."
 
              Tidwell looks at him, chews his toothpick.
 
                                  SUGAR
                               (continuing)
                        You should let me do more for you.
                        I would have had you your deal by
                        tonight.  Al Michaels is a friend
                        of mine. I would have had him on
                        the air, talking about you,
                        tonight, when it counts.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Get outta here.  Go.


                                                                     120.
 
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Where's your agent tonight?
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Don't know.
 
                                  SUGAR
                        Rod.  I know this is "uncool" to
                        do this now, but you belong with
                        the big boys.  You belong with the
                        money. You belong with --
 
              Here comes Jerry Maguire.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Get the fuck away from my guy,
                        Sugar.
 
              Tidwell can't help it.  He beams as he sees his agent
              approach.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Jerry!  You made it --
 
                                  JERRY
                               (off Sugar)
                        Go.  Flee.
 
              Sugar retreats, offering one final look to Rod, think about
              what I said.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Thanks for coming.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (bittersweet)
                        I missed ya.  What can I say?
 
              INT. TIDWELL HOME -- NIGHT
 
              They watch the game.

                        quiet night of this rough football
                        season. Come on, I'm trying to be
                        poetic here.
 
              Tidwell takes a rough hit, and they respond loudly.


                                                                     121.

                        Ooof.  Another rough hit across
                        the middle on Rod Tidwell.
                        Nothing poetic about that.

              Tidwell takes a hit.  Hangs onto the ball.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              The Tidwell clan are banging on t.v. trays and whooping
              loudly. But in the middle of the cheers, Marcee sees the
              unsettled look on young Tyson's face.   She pulls him over to
              her, giving him preference over baby Kaydee.  He is the only
              thing in her world, as she says:
 
                                  MARCEE
                        What does daddy say?
 
                                  TYSON
                        "It looks worse than it is...
 
              Marcee gives him a kiss, as Tidwell makes another grueling
              gain on the field.
 
                                  FRANK GIFFORD'S VOICE
                        They don't pay enough for a man to
                        take that kind of ugly hit --
 
                                  MARCEE
                               (to others)
                        Boy, no s-h-i-t.
 
              Big laughs from the living room.  Except Tee Pee.
 
                                  TEE PEE
                        He's gonna have nothing left for
                        next season.  They're letting him
                        kill himself.
 
                                  MARCEE
                        Can you be quiet?

              back for a pass, and is sacked.


                                                                     122.
 
 
              Philadelphia fans cheer wildly.  The game is turning uglier
              by the minute.  Jerry looks up to the monitor for a closet
              look at the next play.
 
              ON PRESS BOX MONITOR
 
              Swenson, the Arizona quarterback, throws a wobbly pass into
              the end-zone.  Tidwell leaps for the catch, tucks the ball in
              and is promptly and brutally hit by two defenders from two
              different sides.  This hit is bad.  Worse than bad.  Tidwell
              flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes, with a thud,
              ball still in his hands. His head hits the astroturf, hard.
              Tidwell is out cold.  And the ripple effect of the injury
              shoots through the stadium.  Jerry stares at the monitor,
              stunned by the sudden brutality.
 
              EXT. ARIZONA FIELD -- NIGHT
 
              We are thrust into the vortex, inside the game.  Tidwell lies
              still on turf.  Overhead, the fight music continues for a few
              seconds before disappearing abruptly. Players and coaches
              begin to gather around the still body of Rod Tidwell.
 
              TV MONITOR -- SLO-MO
 
              The hit in replay.  It is brutal.  And we can see a flash of
              his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two
              bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side.  One
              cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body
              literally flips.  The second defender then hits him at the
              shoulders.  Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling
              downwards.  Still holding the ball.  Still.
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Silence.  Utter silence.
 
                                  GIFFORD'S VOICE
                        --   you sure hope his family
                        wasn't watching that.
 
              And then, in a cry that gurgles from way down deep, Marcee
              begins to sob.  Camera catches the face of Tyson, now
              panicked.  Scared, he embraces his mother.
 
              INT. BOWELS OF SUN DEVIL STADIUM
 
              Maguire sprints through the inner bowels of the stadium.  He
              turns the corner, into the tunnel, talking his way past a
              guard, heading into the bright t.v. light of the football
              field.


                                                                     123.
 
 
              INT. TIDWELL LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Gathering around the television, the family waits through a
              commercial for more information on Rod's injury.

              Marcee lunges for him.

                        Get out of my house!
 
              Across the room, the phone starts ringing.  A COUSIN answers.
 
                                  COUSIN
                        It's Jerry Maguire!

                        Alright, I'm freaking too.  But
                        they need you to stay calm.  I'll
                        call back.

                        Jerry. It doesn't work without him.
 
              She takes a big gulp, as Jerry watches an overzealous Trainer
              run out onto the field to join the cluster around the fallen
              Tidwell. Jerry covers phone and yells onto the field.
 
                                  JERRY
                        DON'T TOUCH HIM!!!

              We're now just a few inches in front of his peaceful,

              Dead to the world as sound disappears. There is now only
              silence.
 
              POV TIDWELL - SLO-MO -- SILENCE
 
              The Doctors and the Trainers are now truly panicked.  We
              don't hear them.   We see them, their motions increasingly
              manic. Shoving fingers in front of him.  Screaming.  We read
              their lips.  ("Rod!" "Rod can you hear us!")  We see the
              anguish and escalating fear on their faces.  The Trainer
              leans in close, bellowing, he spreads his hands wide to clap
              right in front of Rod's still face.  His hands head toward
              each other... closer... bringing with them the first inkling
              of sound...  getting closer and then finally coming together,
              bringing with him the sounds of the stadium.
 
              ON TIDWELL
 
              who blinks back to life.  Concerned men are yelling very
              loudly, right in his face.  Tidwell becomes aware he is the
              absolute center of attention of the entire stadium.  As crowd
              noise begins to rise.


                                                                     125.

                                  TIDWELL
                        Wait.

                        Yeah.  Just let me enjoy this for
                        a minute.

              Not a breath is taken.  Is he okay?
 
              He rises.  Stadium explodes.  At first on wobbly feet, he
              raises the football and for the first time -- salutes the
              crowd.  Crowd noise doubles.

              Has never felt like this before in his life.  It is the pure
              and absolute love of the spotlight.  And his fans.
 
              And then... it's real and he feels it.  Tidwell breaks out in
              a small but unmistakable move -- a flutter step.  He does a
              high-stepping move, all his own, for about ten yards.
 
              ON JERRY MAGUIRE
 
              who watches, now in complete disbelief. Tidwell will not let

              Going absolutely nuts.  Marcee hysterical, laughing and

                        Nike.
 
              He moves past Jerry Maguire on his way off the field. Jerry,
              casually thumps his heart twice. Jerry Maguire is overcome
              with emotion.  He sits down on a camera case, head in his
              hands.  Behind him, a stadium cheers a new hero.
 
                                  OVERHEARD FAN
                        I always knew he was great.
 
              Maguire rubs his face.  Overcome. Photographers and others
              rush past to be closer to Tidwell.
 
              INT. TUNNEL -- LATER
 
              Jerry Maguire surrounded by well-wishers and backslappers and
              Sportswriters.  Success has returned, in all of it's
              superficial grandeur.  He is a star again, by association.
              We catch the look on Maguire's face.  Try as he might, he
              can't manufacture the joy of the moment.  There is a void.
              Over the heads of the heatseekers we see Dennis Wilburn
              nodding, holding a thumbs up.  He tries to get to Maguire,
              but cannot.  And then a commotion behind them all.
 
                                  REPORTER
                        It's Tidwell!
 
              Tidwell exits the locker room.  Press and media surround him.
              Even the grizzled old-time stadium workers reach in to
              squeeze him, to slap him, to touch him.  He works his way to
              Maguire.
 
              They hug. Cameras flash.  Tears roll down from beneath his
              purple shades.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        We did it.
 
              And now, in the middle of this emotional union, a portable
              phone rings.  Both men reach for their porties.  It's
              Maguire's.  With anticipation, he answers.


                                                                     127.

                        couldn't get through on your phone.
 
              Tidwell grabs the phone, and joyously shares the moment with

              Maguire. He watches, cellular at his side, as a YOUNG AGENT
              approaches.

                        represent that place kicker over

                               (indicates kicker)
                        I wondered if you would sign this
                        for me. Because it inspired me.
 
              He withdraws a well-thumbed copy of Jerry's Mission
              Statement.  The blue cover is ripped along one edge.  It
              clearly has served as a manifesto for this younger man's
              career.

              He feels the cover, flips through it a little.  Memories
              flood with the passing pages.   Shot holds on Jerry's face,
              as Tidwell continues singing in the background.  Suddenly, an
              odd feeling.  A shiver runs up and down his spine.  His
              forehead tingles.  He rubs his face.  All he can do is think
              of Dorothy.

                               (off Jan's guilty
                                look)
                        I've not been fair to you.  Women
                        need to stick together, and not
                        depend on the affections of a man
                        to "fix" their lives.  Maybe
                        you're all correct. Men are the
                        enemy.
 
              Murmurs of agreement.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                               (continuing)
                        But I still love the enemy.
 
              Murmurs of disappointment.


                                                                     129.
 
 
              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry exits cab, holding hang-up bag.  Looks at the house.
              On the other side of that window is a world he hopes he's
              still a part of.
 
              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
 
              Jerry enters.  Dorothy is seated toward the back.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Hello.  I'm looking for my wife.
 
              Dorothy looks up, robbed of words.  Stunned, she does not
              move.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        Alright.  If this is where it has
                        to happen, then this is where it
                        has to happen.
 
              Dorothy says nothing.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        I'm not letting you get rid of me.
                        How about that?
 
              He shares a look with some of the other women.  She's not
              going to say a word.  Neither do they.
 
                                  JERRY
                               (continuing)
                        This used to be my specialty. I
                        was good in a living room.  Send
                        me in there, I'll do it alone. And
                        now I just... I don't know... but
                        on what was supposed to be the
                        happiest night of my business
                        life, it wasn't complete, wasn't
                        nearly close to being in the same
                        vicinity as complete, because I
                        couldn't share it with you.  I
                        couldn't hear your voice, or laugh
                        about it with you.  I missed my
                        wife.  We live in a cynical world,
                        and we work in a business of tough
                        competitors, so try not to laugh --
                               (directly)
                        I love you.  You complete me.
 
                                  DOROTHY
                        Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello.


                                                                     130.
 
 
              He moves to her.  They embrace.  Ray watches in b.g.  Jerry
              has given this room hope.  It's on their faces. At last, even
              Laurel gets off on her sister's happiness, as she shares a
              look with Chad.
 
                                  JAN
                               (sloshing wine)
                        I think we'd better go...
 
              INT. ROY FIRESTONE SHOW -- NIGHT
 
              Roy Firestone leans forward.
 
                                  FIRESTONE
                        ...your father who left the family
                        on Christmas eve, the mother who
                        cleaned the steps of a prison to
                        make your tuition. The older

                        tragic bass fishing accident --
 
              Tidwell is wearing glasses now, in a somewhat scholarly mode.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.

                        -- well, Rod, your agent passed me
                        a note before the show. He says

                        signed by the Arizona Cardinals.

                        I... I love everybody, man.  I
                        love my wife.  My kids.  Little
                        Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My
                        brother Tee Pee. I love my
                        friends, my teammates, who am I
                        leaving out?
 
                                  FIRESTONE
                               (laughing)
                        It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
 
              ON TIDWELL'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY
 
              watching off-camera.  Marcee crying too.  Shot takes us to
              Jerry, Dorothy and Ray.


                                                                     131.
 
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Wanna send some beautiful love out
                        to my offensive line, just a
                        beautiful bunch of dudes, wanna
                        thank a beautiful individual --
                        God, and of course the entire
                        Arizona organization, a little
                        slow, but they do come around.
                        I'm leaving somebody out...
 
              Amused and finally glimpsing the end of a long journey, Jerry
              leans over to Marcee.
 
                                  JERRY
                        Take care, Marcee.  We'll see you
                        at the restaurant.
 
              She nods, emotionally, biting her lip.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent!
                        This is a fierce, loving
                        individual, I love this man, he is
                        love, he is about love -- my
                        ambassador of kwan.
 
                                  FIRESTONE
                        Ten seconds, Rod.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                        And I love my fans, of which he is
                        one. Wanna thank them for all my
                        Sundays, and of course my Monday
                        nights too.  That about says it...
 
              Jerry watches wonderously at the monitor before leaving. TV
              credits are rolling on the show.
 
                                  TIDWELL
                               (continuing)
                        Wait!  And thank you Melvin from
                        the Casual Man, thank you for the
                        suit...
 
              EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY
 
              Jerry, Dorothy, Ray exit into the daylight.  They walk to
              Jerry's car. From across the fence, a stray baseball from a
              pick-up game flies into the parking lot and bounces ahead of
              them.  Ray picks it up. In an easy fluid motion, he whips it
              back over the fence to the game on the other side.  A few
              kids on the other side of the fence shout their approval of
              a great little throw.


                                                                     132.
 
 
              Jerry and Dorothy stop, looking at Ray who has just shown
              shocking natural ability.  They are quiet for a moment,
              turning slowly to look at each other.  And then, not ready to
              deal with it, not even close to ready to deal with it, they
              say quickly to the boy:
 
                           JERRY                         DOROTHY
                   Come on, Ray.                 Ray, let's go.
 
              Happily Ray joins them as they walk to the car.  A family.
              Music.
 
                                                       FADE OUT
 
 
 
                                                 THE END

               EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - DUSK

               JUNO MacGUFF stands on a placid street in a nondescript 
               subdivision, facing the curb. It's FALL. Juno is sixteen 
               years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. She winces 
               and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. The object 
               of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned 
               curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking 
               leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless 
               latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         It started with a chair.

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MOLD-O'-RIFFIC BASEMENT - NIGHT

               FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow. He's 
               sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers 
               herself onto his lap.

               A 60's Brazilian track plays from a vintage record player.

                                     WHISPERED VOICE
                         Do you know how long I've wanted 
                         this?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah.

                                     WHISPERED VOICE
                         Wizard.

               EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - CONTINUED

               A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality.

                                     JUNO
                         Quiet, Banana. Hey, shut your gob 
                         for a second, okay?

               We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away 
               from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         This is the most magnificent discarded 
                         living room set I've ever seen.

               She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and 
               wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.

               BEGIN ANIMATED TITLE SEQUENCE:

               Juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a 
               jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of 
               juice. We watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly 
               on a mission.

               EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

               Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the 
               main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk.

               The automatic doors of the store part to reveal Juno's flushed 
               serious face. She carelessly flings the empty juice container 
               over her shoulder and onto the curb. A group of DROPOUTS 
               with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.

               She enters the DRUGSTORE.

               INT. DRUGSTORE - CONTINUOUS

               ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from 
               behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest.

                                     ROLLO
                         Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the 
                         Crime Dog! Back for another test?

                                     JUNO
                         I think the last one was defective. 
                         The plus sign looked more like a 
                         division sign.

               Rollo regards her with intense skepticism.

                                     JUNO
                         I remain unconvinced.

               Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach.

                                     ROLLO
                         This is your third test today, Mama 
                         Bear. Your eggo is preggo, no doubt 
                         about it!

               An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and 
               lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle.

                                     TOUGH GIRL
                         Three times? Oh girl, you are way 
                         pregnant. It's easy to tell. Is your 
                         nipples real brown?

               A pile of stolen COSMETICS falls out of the girl's jacket 
               and clatters to the floor.

                                     TOUGH GIRL
                         Balls!

               Juno crosses and crosses her legs awkwardly, hopping. It's 
               obvious she has to use the bathroom urgently.

                                     ROLLO
                         Maybe you're having twins. Maybe 
                         your little boyfriend's got mutant 
                         sperms and he knocked you up twice!

                                     JUNO
                         Silencio! I just drank my weight in 
                         Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.

               Rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down 
               one of the aisles.

                         Well, you know where the lavatory 
                         is.
                              (calling after her)
                         You pay for that pee stick when you're 
                         done! Don't think it's yours just 
                         because you've marked it with your 
                         urine!

                                     JUNO
                         Jesus, I didn't say it was.

                                     ROLLO
                         Well, it's not. You're not a lion in 
                         a pride!
                              (to himself)
                         These kids, acting like lions with 
                         their unplanned pregnancies and their 
                         Sunny Delights.

               INT. DRUGSTORE - BATHROOM - DAY

               In the dim, reeking public bathroom, Juno hovers over the 
               commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles. She clumsily 
               tries to use the pregnancy test.

               We see the test box sitting on the sink. It's a TeenWave 
               Discount Pregnancy Test. The accompanying outdated package 
               photo is of a shrugging 80s teen with a resigned expression. 
               The fine print on the box reads "From the makers of Sun-Glitz 
               Lightening Hair Spritz!"

               INT. DRUGSTORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY

               Juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the 
               open test box on the front counter. Rollo scans it and bags 
               it indifferently.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh, and this too.

               She places a giant licorice Super Rope on the counter.

                                     ROLLO
                         So what's the prognosis, Fertile 
                         Myrtle? Minus or plus?

                                     JUNO
                              (examining stick)
                         I don't know. It's not... seasoned 
                         yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that 
                         pink plus sign again. God, it's 
                         unholy.

               She shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the 
               results. Shake. Shake. Nothing.

                                     ROLLO
                         That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch. This is 
                         one doodle that can't be undid, 
                         homeskillet.

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - EVENING

               Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, 
               gnawing on the Super Rope. She stops and loops the Super 
               Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to 
               fashion a noose.

               Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of 
               prairie grass and wild flowers.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Juno's BEDROOM is decorated with punk posters: The Damned, 
               The Germs, the Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc. She 
               picks up a hamburger-shaped phone to call her best friend, 
               LEAH.

               INT. LEAH'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               LEAH's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that 
               certain girls love to hoard. The PHONE rings.

                                     LEAH
                              (answering phone)
                         Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.

                                     JUNO
                         I am a suicide risk.

                                     LEAH
                         Is this Juno?

                                     JUNO
                         No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones 
                         that need collecting?

                                     LEAH
                         Only the one in my pants.

                                     JUNO
                              (in low tones)
                         Dude, I'm pregnant.

                                     LEAH
                         Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you 
                         have a big lunch?

                                     JUNO
                         It's not a food baby. I took three 
                         pregnancy tests today. I am definitely 
                         up the spout.

                                     LEAH
                         How did you even generate enough pee 
                         for three pregnancy tests?

                                     JUNO
                         I drank like ten tons of Sunny 
                         Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. 
                         And you're shockingly cavalier.

                                     LEAH
                         Is this for real? Like for real, for 
                         real?

                                     JUNO
                         Unfortunately, yes.

                                     LEAH
                         Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!

                                     JUNO
                         That's the kind of emotion I was 
                         looking for in the first take.

                                     LEAH
                         Well, are you going to go to 
                         Havenbrooke or Women Now for the 
                         abortion? You need a note from your 
                         parents for Havenbrooke.

                                     JUNO
                         I know. Women Now, I guess. The 
                         commercial says they help women now.

                                     LEAH
                         Want me to call for you? I called 
                         for Becky last year.

                                     JUNO
                         Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do 
                         need your help with something very 
                         urgent.

               EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT

               Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well 
               manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team.

                                     LEAH
                         Heavy lifting can only help you at 
                         this point.

                                     JUNO
                         That is sick, man.

               Leah busts a gut laughing. It's a stunningly accurate 
               portrayal of Bleeker's parents.

                                     LEAH
                         So, you were bored? Is that how this 
                         blessed miracle came to be?

                                     JUNO
                         Nah, it was a premeditated act. The 
                         sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.

                                     LEAH
                         When did you decide you were going 
                         to do Bleeker?

                                     JUNO
                         Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SPANISH CLASS - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

               Bleeker and Juno are sitting at their desks, listening to a 
               teacher lecturing about spanish. Bleeker discreetly pushes a 
               POSTCARD to Juno with his foot. She picks it up off the floor, 
               reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher 
               obediently.

               EXT. CENTENNIAL LANE - NIGHT

                                     LEAH
                         Aha! You love him.

                                     JUNO
                         It's extremely complicated, and I'd 
                         rather not talk about it in my fragile 
                         state.

               She hefts a coffee table with her bare hands. She's wearing 
               her father's LIFTING BELT.

                                     LEAH
                         So, what was it like humping Bleeker's 
                         bony bod?

                                     JUNO
                         It was magnificent, man!

               INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               CU of Bleeker putting on double socks in his Car-Bed.

               CU of Bleeker putting on his sweat bands.

               CU of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide.

               INT. KITCHEN - BLEEKER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

               CU of a CROISSANT POCKET warming in the microwave.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING

               PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for 
               early morning track practice. He wears a cross country uniform 
               that reads "DANCING ELK CONDORS." He is eating some kind of 
               microwaved snack gimmick.

               Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting 
               for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the 
               front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe 
               officiously.

                                     JUNO
                         Hey Bleek.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Cool.

                                     JUNO
                         Your shorts are looking especially 
                         gold today.

                              (a beat)
                         So, guess what?

                                     BLEEKER
                              (shrugs)
                         I don't know...

                                     JUNO
                         I'm pregnant.

               Stunned silence. Juno pops up the footrest of the recliner 
               and leans back comfortably.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I guess so.
                              (fidgeting)
                         What are you going to do?

               The Dancing Elk Prep cross country team runs past Bleeker's 
               house in a thundering herd, wearing a motley assortment of 
               warm-ups. Their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves. 
               They wave and holler at Bleeker and Juno.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         When I see them all running like 
                         that, with their things bouncing 
                         around in their shorts, I always 
                         picture them naked, even if I don't 
                         want to. I have intrusive thoughts 
                         all the time.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - CONTINUED

                                     BLEEKER
                         I'm supposed to be running.

                                     JUNO
                         I know.

               There's an awkward silence.

                                     BLEEKER
                         So, what do you think we should do?

                                     JUNO
                         I thought I might, you know, nip it 
                         in the bud before it gets worse. 
                         Because I heard in health class that 
                         pregnancy often results in an infant.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yeah, typically. That's what happens 
                         when our moms and teachers get 
                         pregnant.

                                     JUNO
                         So that's cool with you, then?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do 
                         what you think is right.

                                     JUNO
                         I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I 
                         know it wasn't your idea.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Whose idea was it?

                                     JUNO
                         I'll see you at school, O.K.?

               She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off.

                              (to nobody in 
                              particular)
                         Whose idea was it?

               EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - DAY

               Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a 
               lock around it. In the background, a group of 3 NERDS play a 
               live-action RPG.

                                     NERD
                         You did not! You don't have the armor. 
                         That Orc Armor you bought from the 
                         wizard doesn't have the power level 
                         to parry my hit!

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

               Juno tries to push through the masses, but the throng of 
               students is thick and unwielding.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

               Juno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with 
               photos of Leah and Bleeker, plus a giant poster of Iggy Pop 
               in his heyday.

               She grabs a dilapidated physics textbook. A few pages slip 
               out. STEVE RENDAZO (the same asshole who harassed her as she 
               walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway.

                                     STEVE RENDAZO
                         Hey, your book fell apart!

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah.

                                     STEVE RENDAZO
                         It must have looked at your face. 
                         PWAH!

               He high-fives his klatch of buddies and moves along.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo 
                         secretly wants me. Jocks like him 
                         always want freaky girls. Girls with 
                         horn-rimmed glasses and vegan footwear 
                         and Goth makeup. Girls who play the 
                         cello and wear Converse All-Stars 
                         and want to be children's librarians 
                         when they grow up. Oh yeah, jocks 
                         eat that shit up.

               We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with 
               mixed feelings.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         They just won't admit it, because 
                         they're supposed to be into perfect 
                         cheerleaders like Leah. Who, 
                         incidentally, is into teachers.

               We see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly 
               with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH.

                                     LEAH
                              (from a distance)
                         Me too! I love Woody Allen!

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - SCIENCE LAB - DAY

               STUDENTS bustle in, as the teacher, MR. TINKER tries to 
               maintain order. Juno heads toward her desk and sets down her 
               bag.

                                     MR. TINKER
                         People! We're doing our photomagnetism 
                         lab today, so find your partner and 
                         break out into fours.

               Juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner: 
               Bleeker. Sound the gong of awkwardness!

               Juno and Bleeker head separately over to an available lab 
               station and unpack their bags in silence.

                                     JUNO
                         Well! Nothing like experimenting.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I did the prep questions for this 
                         lab last night. You can copy my 
                         answers if you need to.

               He slides a piece of graph paper in front of Juno without 
               looking at her.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh, I couldn't copy your work.

                                     BLEEKER
                         But you copy my work every week.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab 
                         partner, huh?

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't mind. You definitely bring 
                         something to the table.

                                     JUNO
                         Charisma?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Or something.

               The other two LAB PARTNERS, a humorless couple, join them at 
               the station.

                                     JUNO
                         So, who's ready for some 
                         photomagnificence?

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         I have a menstrual migraine, and I 
                         can't look at bright lights today.

                                     GUY LAB PARTNER
                         Amanda, I told you to go to the 
                         infirmary and lie down. You never 
                         listen.

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         No Josh, I don't take orders. Not 
                         from you and not from any man.

                                     GUY LAB PARTNER
                         You know, you've been acting like 
                         this ever since I went up to see my 
                         brother at Mankato. I told you, 
                         nothing happened!

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         Something happened. Because your 
                         eyes? Are very cold? They're very 
                         cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.

                                     GUY LAB PARTNER
                         What? My eyes are not lying!

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, 
                         they have been lying eyes.

               Juno and Bleeker observe the argument like tennis spectators, 
               fascinated by the dynamics of a real couple.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Okay... I'm going to set up the 
                         apparatus. Juno, want to get a C 
                         clamp out of that drawer?

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         I'm going to the infirmary.

                                     GUY LAB PARTNER
                         Good. Call me when you're OFF the 
                         rag.

                                     GIRL LAB PARTNER
                         Fine. Call me when you learn how to 
                         love just one person and not cheat 
                         at your brother's college just because 
                         you had four Smirnoff Ices and a 
                         bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored 
                         Boone's!

                                     GUY LAB PARTNER
                         Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. 
                         I'll make a note of it.

               He furiously scrawls a fake memo in his notebook.

                                     JUNO
                         Snow Peak Peach is the best flavor 
                         of Boone's. Right, Bleek?

               Bleeker reddens and continues constructing the apparatus. 
               GIRL LAB PARTNER stalks off dramatically.

               Bleeker shakes his head and rifles through his textbook.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

               Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper that depicts a 
               distraught TEEN GIRL clutching her head in a moment of staged 
               conflict. The ad reads: "Pregnant? Find the clinic that gives 
               women choice. Women's Choice Health Center."

               Juno picks up her hamburger phone and dials. For a moment, 
               she attempts to copy the melodramatic pose from the ad, 
               checking herself out in the mirror.

                                     JUNO
                              (talking along with 
                              voice prompt)
                         "Para instruciones en Espanol, oprima 
                         numero dos."

               She presses a few buttons in succession.

                                     JUNO
                         Yes, hello, I need to procure a hasty 
                         abortion?... What was that? I'm sorry, 
                         I'm on my hamburger phone and it's 
                         kind of awkward to talk on. It's 
                         really more of a novelty than a 
                         functional appliance.

               She SMACKS the phone a couple of times.

                                     JUNO
                         Better? Okay, good. Yeah, as I said, 
                         I need an abortion, two... sixteen... 
                         Um, it was approximately two months 
                         and four days ago that I had the 
                         sex. That's a guestimate. Okay, next 
                         Saturday? Great.

               She hangs up the phone.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         I hate it when adults use the term 
                         "sexually active."

                         What does that even mean? Can I 
                         deactivate someday, or is this a 
                         permanent state of being? I guess 
                         Bleeker went live that night we did 
                         it. I guess he hadn't done it before, 
                         and that's why he got that look on 
                         his face.

                         I moved an entire living room set 
                         from one lawn to another, or the one 
                         in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce 
                         blue slushie in ten minutes?

               Bren speaks in her strong city accent.

                                     BREN
                         Juno? Did you happen to barf in my 
                         urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by 
                         the front door, the one I got up in 
                         Stillwater? I found some weird blue 
                         shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there 
                         this morning.

                                     JUNO
                         I would never barf in your urn, 
                         Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.

               We see Liberty Bell blithely pouring bacon bits onto her 
               dinner.

                                     MAC
                         Liberty Bell, if I see one more Baco 
                         on that potato, I'm gonna kick your 
                         monkey ass.

               EXT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - DAY

               Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. There 
               is a lone ABORTION PROTESTER, a teenager of Asian descent 
               holding a hugely oversized sign that reads "NO BABIES LIKE 
               MURDERING."

                                     LONE PROTESTER
                              (chanting in extremely 
                              shy, accented voice)
                         All babies want to get borned! All 
                         babies want to get borned!

               Juno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers.

                                     JUNO
                         Uh, hi Su-Chin.

                                     SU-CHIN
                         Oh, hi Juno. How are you?

                                     JUNO
                         Good. I'm good.
                              (pause)
                         Did you finish that paper for Worth's 
                         class yet?

                                     SU-CHIN
                         No, not yet. I tried to work on it a 
                         little last night, but I'm having 
                         trouble concentrating.

                                     JUNO
                         You should try Adderall.

                                     SU-CHIN
                         No thanks. I'm off pills.

                                     JUNO
                         Wise move. I know this girl who had 
                         a huge crazy freakout because she 
                         took too many behavioral meds at 
                         once. She took off her clothes and 
                         jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale 
                         Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! 
                         I'm a kraken from the sea!"

                                     SU-CHIN
                         I heard that was you.

                                     JUNO
                         Well, it was nice seeing you.

               She continues on toward the clinic entrance.

                                     SU-CHIN
                              (calling out)
                         Juno! Your baby probably has a beating 
                         heart, you know. It can feel pain. 
                         And it has fingernails.

                                     JUNO
                         Really? Fingernails?

               She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door.

               INT. WOMEN'S CHOICE CLINIC - RECEPTION - DAY

               The receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass. 
               The waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant 
               women, teens and ill-behaved children.

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         Welcome to Women's Choice, where 
                         women are trusted friends. Please 
                         put your hands where I can see them 
                         and surrender any bombs.

               Juno flashes her best jazz hands.

                                     JUNO
                         Hi. I'm here for the big show?

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         Your name, please?

                                     JUNO
                         Juno MacGuff.

               The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some 
               paperwork on a clipboard.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         She thinks I'm using a fake name. 
                         Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.

               The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen.

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         I need you to fill these out, both 
                         sides. And don't skip the hairy 
                         details. We need to know about every 
                         score and every sore.

               The receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women's 
               clinic CONDOM JARS, and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers.

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         Would you like some free condoms? 
                         They're boysenberry.

                                     JUNO
                         No thank you. I'm off sex.

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         My partner uses these every time we 
                         have intercourse. They make his balls 
                         smell like pie.

                                     JUNO
                         Congrats.

               She takes a seat in the WAITING ROOM and rifles through a 
               pile of old magazines. The magazine selection is lots of 
               "mommy mags" and health related periodicals. She selects an 
               issue of Family Digest and gingerly flips through for a few 
               moments.

               Then she looks over and notices the FINGERNAILS of a nearby 
               teen, who looks as nervous as she does. The girl bites her 
               thumbnail and spits it onto the floor.

               Juno looks away, but immediately notices another waiting 
               woman, who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails. 
               Suddenly, she sees fingernails EVERYWHERE. The receptionist 
               clicks her nails on the front desk. Another woman blows on 
               her fresh manicure. Everyone seems to be fidgeting with their 
               fingers somehow. Juno suddenly looks terror-stricken...

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     PUNK RECEPTIONIST
                         Excuse me, Miss MacGoof?

               There's no answer. We see that Juno's chair is EMPTY.

               The receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door 
               drift shut. Juno's figure recedes into the distance as she 
               tears off down the street, running as fast as she can.

               EXT. LEAH'S HOUSE - DAY

               Leah's front door swings open to reveal a breathless Juno 
               standing sheepishly on the porch. Leah sighs.

                                     LEAH
                         What are you doing here, dumbass? I 
                         thought I was supposed to pick you 
                         up at four.

                                     JUNO
                         I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled 
                         like a dentist in there. They had 
                         these really horrible magazines, 
                         with, like, spritz cookie recipes 
                         and bad fiction and water stains, 
                         like someone read them in the tub. 
                         And the receptionist tried to give 
                         me these weird condoms that looked 
                         like grape suckers, and she told me 
                         about her boyfriend's pie balls, and 
                         Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told 
                         me the baby had fingernails. 
                         Fingernails!

                                     LEAH
                         Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's 
                         claws could scratch your vag on the 
                         way out?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm staying pregnant, Le.

                                     LEAH
                         Keep your voice down dude, my mom's 
                         around here somewhere. She doesn't 
                         know we're sexually active.

                                     JUNO
                         What does that even mean? Anyway, I 
                         got to thinking on the way over. I 
                         was thinking maybe I could give the 
                         baby to somebody who actually likes 
                         that kind of thing. You know, like a 
                         woman with a bum ovary or something. 
                         Or some nice lesbos.

                                     LEAH
                         But then you'll get huge. Your chest 
                         is going to milktate. And you have 
                         to tell everyone you're pregnant.

                                     JUNO
                         I know. Maybe they'll canonize me 
                         for being so selfless.

                                     LEAH
                         Maybe they'll totally shit and be 
                         super mad at you and not let you 
                         graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for 
                         spring break.

                                     JUNO
                         Bleeker and I were going to go to 
                         Gettysburg for spring break.

               Leah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend.

                                     LEAH
                         Well, maybe you could look at one of 
                         those adoption ads. I see them all 
                         the time in the Penny Saver.

                                     JUNO
                         There are ads? For parents?

                                     LEAH
                         Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." 
                         They're right by the ads for like, 
                         iguanas and terriers and used fitness 
                         equipment. It's totally legit.

                                     JUNO
                         Come on, Leah. I can't scope out 
                         wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! 
                         That's tacky. That's like buying 
                         clothes at the Pump n' Munch.

               EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

               Juno and Leah are sitting at a bench in a park. They slurp 
               giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of Penny Savers.

               Juno has her pipe with her.

                                     JUNO
                         The Penny Saver sucks.

                                     LEAH
                         Yeah, but it sucks for free.

               They turn the pages in silence for a moment. Their lips and 
               teeth are Windex-blue.

                                     LEAH
                         Look at this one "Wholesome, 
                         spiritually wealthy couple have found 
                         true love with each other."
                              (checks to see that 
                              Juno is paying 
                              attention)
                         "All that's missing is your bastard."

                                     JUNO
                              (reading a different 
                              page)
                         There's a guy in here who's giving 
                         away a piano. Free for the hauling! 
                         We should put it in Bleeker's yard.

                                     LEAH
                         You're not listening to me.

                                     JUNO
                         No, I heard you. I just can't give 
                         the baby to people who describe 
                         themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking 
                         for something a little edgier.

                                     LEAH
                         What did you have in mind, a family 
                         of disturbed loners who are into 
                         gunplay and incest?

                                     JUNO
                         I was thinking a graphic designer, 
                         mid-thirties, and his cool Asian 
                         wife who dresses awesome and plays 
                         bass. But I'm trying to not be too 
                         particular.

                                     LEAH
                         All right, how about this one? 
                         "Healthy, educated couple seeking 
                         infant to join our family of five. 
                         You will be compensated. Help us 
                         complete the circle of love."

                                     JUNO
                         Yeesh, they sound like a cult. 
                         Besides, they're greedy bitches. 
                         They already have three kids!

                                     LEAH
                         Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.

               She points to the paper and motions for Juno to look. Juno 
               scans the ad silently.

               We see the ad. It contains a photo of an attractive couple 
               with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles. It reads "Educated, 
               successful couple wishes to..."

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         They were Mark and Vanessa Loring, 
                         and they were beautiful even in black 
                         and white.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S WINDOW - NIGHT

               We see Paulie's bedroom window -- festooned with childish 
               curtains -- and the light on inside.

               INT. BLEEKER'S HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening 
               to the same LP from when he and Juno went all the way.

               He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep 
               yearbook.

               We see the object of his gaze is Juno's black and white 
               YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten 
               message from Juno. We hear Juno's voice reading the message:

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         Hey Bleeker! Spank off to this with 
                         motion lotion. Just kidding (kind 
                         of.) Your best friend, Juno.

               Bleeker picks up the phone. It's the same HAMBURGER PHONE 
               Juno has. He reconsiders and puts it down.

               There's a knock on the bedroom door.

               BLEEKER'S MOM pokes her dowdy head inside.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         Paul? Are you coming downstairs to 
                         eat?

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't think so.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         You ran eight miles today, Puppy.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I'm not hungry, oddly.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         But it's breakfast for supper. Your 
                         favorite, Paulie. I made French toast 
                         and sausage. Patties, not linkies, 
                         just like you like it.

               Bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         Juno MacGuff called while you were 
                         out running. She wants to know if 
                         you're coming to her little 
                         coffeehouse performance on Saturday.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Thanks for the message.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         You know how I feel about her.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You've mentioned it about fifty times.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         I just hope you don't consider her a 
                         close friend.

               Bleeker's mom gives up and closes the door.

               We see that Bleeker is clutching a pair of PANTIES in one 
               hand, which he slowly releases as the 45 ends.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Bren and MAC are seated on the couch. Leah is standing nearby 
               for reinforcements. Juno paces nervously, trying to suss out 
               how to break the massive news.

                                     JUNO
                         I have no idea how to spit this out.

                                     BREN
                         Hon, did you get expelled?

                                     JUNO
                         No. The school would probably contact 
                         you in the event of my expulsion.

                                     BREN
                         Well, I was just asking. It seemed 
                         plausible.

                                     MAC
                         Do you need a large sum of money? 
                         Legal counsel?

                                     JUNO
                         No, no, I'm definitely not asking 
                         for anything. Except maybe mercy. 
                         Like, it would be really great if 
                         nobody hit me.

                                     MAC
                         What have you done, Junebug? Did you 
                         hit someone with the Previa?

                                     LEAH
                         Best to just tell them, man. Rip off 
                         the Band-Aid and let it bleed.

                                     JUNO
                         I'm pregnant.

               Bren and Mac are predictably speechless.

                                     BREN
                         Oh, God...

                                     JUNO
                         But I'm going to give it up for 
                         adoption. I already found the perfect 
                         people.

               Leah presents the Penny Saver photos of the Lornings.

                                     JUNO
                         They say they're going to pay my 
                         medical expenses and everything. I 
                         promise this will all be resolved in 
                         thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend 
                         it never happened.

                                     MAC
                         You're pregnant?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any 
                         consolation, I have heartburn that's 
                         like, radiating down to my kneecaps 
                         and I haven't gone number two since 
                         Wednesday. Morning!

                                     BREN
                              (interrupting)
                         I didn't even know you were sexually 
                         active!

               Juno cringes upon hearing her most-hated term.

                                     MAC
                         Who is the kid?

                                     JUNO
                         The baby? I don't know anything about 
                         it yet. I only know it's got 
                         fingernails, allegedly.

                                     BREN
                         Nails? Really?

                                     MAC
                         No, I mean the father! Who's the 
                         father, Juno?

                                     JUNO
                         Oh. It's, well, it's Paulie Bleeker.

               Bren and Mac burst into shocked laughter.

                                     JUNO
                         What?

                                     MAC
                         Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had 
                         it in him!

                                     BREN
                              (giggling)
                         He just doesn't look, well, virile.

                                     LEAH
                         I know, right?

                                     MAC
                         Okay, this is no laughing matter.

                                     JUNO
                              (indignant)
                         No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by 
                         the way. He was very good in... chair.

               Leah fires a be quiet glance at Juno.

                                     MAC
                         Did you say you were thinking about 
                         adoption?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, well, there's this couple who've 
                         been trying to have a baby for five 
                         years.

                                     LEAH
                         We found them in the Penny Saver by 
                         the exotic birds section.

               Bren looks understandably alarmed. Juno hastily attempts to 
               make the situation sound more legitimate.

                                     JUNO
                         But they have a real lawyer and 
                         everything. I'm going to meet with 
                         them next weekend.

                                     BREN
                         Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing 
                         to do. Probably tougher than you can 
                         understand right now.

                                     JUNO
                         Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.

                                     MAC
                         Damn skippy, you're not! You don't 
                         even remember to give Liberty Bell 
                         her breathing meds.

                                     JUNO
                         Once! And she didn't die, if you 
                         recall!

                                     BREN
                         Honey, had you considered, you know, 
                         the alternative?

               Leah and Juno exchange glances.

                                     JUNO
                         No.

                                     BREN
                         Well, you're a brave young lady. 
                         You're made of stronger stuff than I 
                         thought. You're a little Viking!

                                     JUNO
                         Cool it.

                                     BREN
                         First things first, we have to get 
                         you healthy. You need prenatal 
                         vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do 
                         incredible things for your nails, so 
                         that's a plus. Oh, and we need to 
                         schedule a doctor's appointment. 
                         Find out where you're going to 
                         deliver.

                                     JUNO
                         The term "deliver" is so weird. Can 
                         we not say "deliver"?

                                     LEAH
                         How does "crap it out" sound?

                                     MAC
                         Juno, I want to come with you to 
                         meet these adoption people. You're 
                         just a kid. I don't want you to get 
                         ripped off by a couple of babystarved 
                         wingnuts.

                                     JUNO
                         Sure, Dad.

               Mac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally.

                                     MAC
                         I thought you were the kind of girl 
                         who knew when to say when.

                                     JUNO
                         I have no idea what kind of girl I 
                         am.

                                     BREN
                              (sensing tension)
                         Why don't you girls go upstairs for 
                         a while? I think Mac's gonna blow.

               Juno and Leah hightail it upstairs.

                                     MAC
                         Just tell it to me straight, Bren. 
                         Do you think this is my fault? Her 
                         mother's fault?

                                     BREN
                         I think kids get bored and have 
                         intercourse. And I think Junebug was 
                         a dummy about it. But we have to 
                         move on from here and help her figure 
                         it out.

                                     MAC
                         I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.

                                     BREN
                         You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. 
                         And Juno's not going to be a ma. 
                         Somebody else is going to find a 
                         precious blessing from Jesus in this 
                         garbage dump of a situation. I 
                         friggin' hope.

                                     MAC
                              (conspiratorially)
                         Did you see it coming when she sat 
                         us down here?

                                     BREN
                         Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she 
                         was expelled or into hard drugs.

                                     MAC
                         That was my first instinct too. Or 
                         D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm 
                         going to punch that Bleeker kid in 
                         the weiner the next time I see him.

                                     BREN
                         Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You 
                         know it wasn't his idea.

               Mac shrugs in agreement.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - DAY

               Music plays as we see SPARSE IMAGES OF VANESSA LORING'S HANDS 
               preparing the house for Juno's arrival --

               Sprucing a vase of FLOWERS.

               Straightening a FRAMED PHOTO of the Lorings.

               Dusting off a table with one of those WETNAPS for furniture.

               Lining up a shelf of BOOKS.

               EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - DAY

               The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated 
               community. Mac pulls over and parks on the curb.

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

               Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic 
               McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil. Mac presses 
               the doorbell while Juno chews her nails uncomfortably. Both 
               look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them.

               VANESSA opens the door. She's a pretty, meticulous woman in 
               her early thirties. Very Banana Republic.

                                     VANESSA
                         Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno 
                         and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.

                                     JUNO
                         Vanessa, right?

                                     MAC
                         Hello. Thank you for having me and 
                         my irresponsible child over to your 
                         home.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

               Vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home.

                                     VANESSA
                         Can I take your coats?

                                     JUNO
                         Sure.

               She takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into 
               Vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench.

                                     JUNO
                         Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by 
                         the way. Super classy. Not like those 
                         other people with the fake woods in 
                         the background. Like I'm really going 
                         to fall for that, you know?

                                     VANESSA
                         You found us in the Penny Saver?

               MARK LORING appears next to Vanessa. He's a boyishly 
               attractive guy in his mid-thirties.

               He glances sheepishly at Vanessa upon hearing the Penny Saver 
               mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno.

                                     MARK
                         Hi. I'm Mark Loring. I'm the husband.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Mark and Vanessa usher Juno and Mac into the austere, spacious 
               living room. A woman in a business suit sits on the couch 
               with a briefcase in her lap.

                                     MARK
                         This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.

                                     JUNO
                              (in exaggerated, 
                              growling German accent)
                         Geeeerta Rauuuss!

                                     GERTA
                              (straight)
                         Nice to meet you.

               Mac seizes Mark's hand and pumps it heartily.

                                     MAC
                         I'm Mac MacGuff, and this, of course, 
                         is my daughter Juno.

                                     MARK
                         Like the city in Alaska?

                                     JUNO
                         No.

                                     MARK
                         Cool. Well, let's sit down and get 
                         to know each other a bit.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'll get drinks. What would everyone 
                         like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin 
                         Water...

                                     JUNO
                         A Maker's Mark, please. Up.

                                     MAC
                         She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful 
                         sense of humor, which is just one of 
                         her many genetic gifts.

                                     JUNO
                         I also have good teeth. No cavities. 
                         We finally got fluoridated water in 
                         Dancing Elk.

               She bares them frighteningly to demonstrate.

               Vanessa stares, unflappable.

                                     MAC
                         We're fine, thank you.

               Mac and Juno join Mark and Gerta Rauss on the couch.

                                     GERTA
                         So, Juno. First off, how far along 
                         are you?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm a junior.

                                     GERTA
                         No, I mean in your pregnancy.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the 
                         doctor yesterday and they said I was 
                         twelve weeks.

               Vanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost 
                         into your second trimester, then?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on 
                         May 4.

                                     VANESSA
                         The tough part's almost over for 
                         you. I mean, my girlfriends always 
                         tell me the first couple months are 
                         the hardest.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm 
                         more worried about the part where I 
                         have to start wearing jeans with an 
                         elastic panel in the front.

                                     VANESSA
                         I think pregnancy is beautiful.

                                     JUNO
                         Well, you're lucky it's not you.

               Vanessa's looks to the ceiling.

                                     MARK
                              (clearing throat)
                         So, let's discuss how we're gonna do 
                         this... thing.

                                     JUNO
                         Well, I just have the baby and give 
                         it to you, right?

                                     GERTA
                         Mark and Vanessa are willing to 
                         negotiate an open adoption.

                                     MAC
                              (protective)
                         Wait. What does that mean?

                                     GERTA
                         It means they'd send annual updates, 
                         photos, let Juno know how the baby 
                         is doing as he or she grows up. Of 
                         course, Juno's legal rights would be 
                         terminated...

                                     JUNO
                         Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. 
                         I don't need to be notified of 
                         anything. Can't we just kick it old 
                         school? I could just put the baby in 
                         a basket and send it your way. You 
                         know, like Moses in the reeds.

                                     MARK
                         Technically, that would be kickin' 
                         it Old Testament.

               Mark and Juno lock eyes.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to 
                         do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping 
                         off a Band-Aid.

                                     GERTA
                         Well, then we agree a traditional 
                         closed adoption would be best for 
                         all involved, then?

                                     JUNO
                         Shit, yeah. Close it up.

               Vanessa is clearly ecstatic.

                                     MARK
                         Obviously, we'll compensate you for 
                         your medical expenses.

                                     VANESSA
                         Are you looking for any other 
                         compensation?

                                     MAC
                         Excuse me?

                                     JUNO
                         Well, no... I'm not going to sell 
                         the baby. I just want it to grow up 
                         with people who are ready to love it 
                         and be parents. I'm in high school, 
                         dude. I'm ill-equipped.

                                     VANESSA
                         You're doing an amazing and selfless 
                         thing for us.

                                     MARK
                         Vanessa has wanted a baby since we 
                         got married.

                                     VANESSA
                         I want to be a mommy so badly!

               Juno and Mac stare at her.

                                     MAC
                         You don't say.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, haven't you ever felt like you 
                         were born to do something?

                                     MAC
                         Yes. Heating and air conditioning.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, I was born to be a mother. 
                         Some of us are.

                                     JUNO
                         Mark, are you looking forward to 
                         being a dad?

               Mark is caught off guard.

                                     MARK
                         Sure, why not? I mean, every guy 
                         wants to be a father. Coach soccer, 
                         help with science projects and... I 
                         don't know. Fatherly stuff.

               Mac casts a subtle, dubious glance at Mark.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, shall we start looking over 
                         the paperwork? Gerta has already 
                         drafted some preliminary documents.

                                     JUNO
                         Can I use the facilities first? Being 
                         pregnant makes you pee like 
                         Seabiscuit.

                                     VANESSA
                         Sure. The powder room down here is 
                         being re-tiled, but you can use the 
                         master bath upstairs. Go up, then 
                         turn left and on your right...

                                     JUNO
                         Room with a toilet, got it.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY/STAIRS - DAY

               Juno heads into the foyer and up the stairs. We see a posed 
               photo of Mark and Vanessa in the stairwell. Their house is 
               beautiful, but frigid. Juno rubs her arms, shivering.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

               The Loring's bathroom is huge. Juno flushes and goes to the 
               double sink to wash her hands. She opens the overhead cabinet 
               and sees Vanessa's toiletries. She spritzes on some perfume 
               and examines the more expensive grooming items. There's a 
               crinkled tube of LUBE in the cabinet. Juno picks it up, 
               fascinated. She rubs a drop of it between her hands and runs 
               it through her hair like pomade.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               Juno opens the bathroom door and instantly BUMPS into Mark.

                                     JUNO
                         Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to 
                         see you up here.

                                     MARK
                         Sorry. I was just getting something.

                                     JUNO
                         Did your wife send you up here to 
                         spy on me?

                                     MARK
                         What? No! Do we come off like paranoid 
                         yuppies or something?

                                     JUNO
                         Well, you don't just invite a random 
                         pregnant teenager into your house 
                         and leave her unsupervised. I could 
                         be a total klepto, for all you know.

                                     MARK
                         I don't get a klepto vibe from you. 
                         Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't 
                         rule it out.

                                     JUNO
                         I did steal a squirt of perfume. 
                         What do you think? It's Clinique 
                         Happy.

               She holds her WRIST up to Mark's twitching nostrils.

                                     JUNO
                         Smell those sparkling topnotes!

               Mark inhales.

                                     MARK
                         Am I supposed to feel happy now?

                                     JUNO
                         You should be happy, Holmes. I'm 
                         giving you and Vanessa the gift of 
                         life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! 
                         And you don't even have to be there 
                         when the baby comes out of me all 
                         covered in...

                                     MARK
                         Viscera?

                                     JUNO
                         Blood and guts.

                                     MARK
                         We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.

               Juno mocks his use of "ASAP" silently.

                                     JUNO
                              (halting)
                         Wait a minute. Is that a Les Paul?

               Juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar. We 
               see GUITARS mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters.

                                     MARK
                         Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa 
                         lets me have a room for all my old 
                         stuff.

                                     JUNO
                         Wow, you get a whole room in your 
                         own house? She's got you on a long 
                         leash there, Mark.

                                     MARK
                         Shut up.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S "SPECIAL" ROOM - DAY

               The walls are plastered with FRAMED POSTERS of early-90s alt 
               rock bands. (Mudhoney, Jane's Addiction etc.) Mark removes 
               his LES PAUL from its moorings and hands it to Juno.

                                     JUNO
                         It's beautiful. I've always liked 
                         Gibson better than Fender.

                                     MARK
                         What do you play?

                                     JUNO
                         I rock a Harmony.

                                     MARK
                              (holding back a chuckle)
                         Oh.

                                     JUNO
                         What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.

                                     MARK
                         Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.

               Juno turns the guitar over, examining it closely.

                                     JUNO
                         What is that, Mahogany? What happens 
                         if you crack the neck?

                                     MARK
                         Tell me about it. I used to play in 
                         a really tight band back when I lived 
                         in Chicago, and one night we opened 
                         for the Melvins... do you know who 
                         the Melvins are?

                                     JUNO
                              (lying)
                         Yeah.

                                     MARK
                         Well, we were playing with them and 
                         I busted this guitar onstage. It 
                         cost me $800 and a dime bag just to 
                         have it fixed.

                                     JUNO
                         When was this, like '96?

                                     MARK
                         '93. I'm telling you that was the 
                         best time for rock and roll.

                                     JUNO
                         Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You 
                         weren't there, so you can't understand 
                         the magic.

                                     MARK
                         You weren't even alive!

               INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Vanessa, Mac and Gerta Rauss are waiting in awkward silence 
               for Juno and Mark to return. Mac notices a brand new PILATES 
               MACHINE sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room.

                                     MAC
                         So. What's that thing?

                                     VANESSA
                         A Pilates machine?

                                     MAC
                         What do you make with that?

                                     VANESSA
                         You don't make anything. It's for 
                         exercising.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - SAME

               Mark and Juno tool around on the guitars unplugged. They 
               play little riffs. He teaches her a couple chords.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

                                     MAC
                         My wife just ordered one of those 
                         Tony Little Gazelles off the TV, you 
                         know, from the guy with the ponytail?

               Vanessa and Gerta have no response.

                                     MAC
                         That guy just doesn't look right to 
                         me.

               Suddenly, a shriek of AMP FEEDBACK, followed by loud, 
               discordant GUITAR STRUMMING can be heard drifting down from 
               upstairs. Vanessa's looks to the ceiling.

                                     VANESSA
                              (to her guests)
                         Will you excuse me?

               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY

               Mark has strapped on the Les Paul and is playing and singing. 
               "Doll Parts" by Hole.

                                     JUNO AND MARK
                              (quietly singing 
                              together)
                         "Yeah, they really want you... they 
                         really want you... they really do."

               Building together.

                                     JUNO AND MARK
                              (singing together and 
                              connecting)
                         Yeah, they really want you... they 
                         really want you... and I do to.
                              (both blush)

               VANESSA appears in the doorway. Juno immediately puts down 
               the guitar. Mark doesn't notice her immediately.

                                     MARK
                              (passionate singing)
                         I WANT TO BE THE...
                              (notices Vanessa)
                         Oh, sorry honey...

               Mark clumsily puts down the guitar and stands up.

                                     VANESSA
                         You guys are playing music?

                                     MARK
                         Juno just wanted a closer look at 
                         Kimber here.

                                     JUNO
                         Your guitar is named Kimber?

                                     MARK
                         Yeah.

                                     JUNO
                         That's all right. My axe is named 
                         Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. 
                         Franklin was the hot one with the 
                         polio.

                                     VANESSA
                         I think Gerta is waiting for us 
                         downstairs with some important stuff 
                         for us to go over.

               Mark hangs the guitars back on the wall. He and Juno exit 
               the room, chastised. Vanessa looks to Mark in question.

                                     VANESSA
                         Didn't mean to interrupt the jam 
                         sessions.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY

               Juno and Mac have put their coats on and are in the process 
               of leaving. Gerta hands Juno the DOCUMENTS. Vanessa and Mark 
               trail behind.

                                     GERTA
                         So, look those over and give me a 
                         call at my office if you have any 
                         questions.

                         Juno, we'd really appreciate it if 
                         you could keep us updated on any 
                         doctor's appointments, ultrasounds, 
                         other things of that nature.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to 
                         know how your kid is cooking.

                                     VANESSA
                         So, then, you really think you're 
                         going to go ahead with this?

               Mac STARES at Juno gravely.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah. For sure. I like you guys.

               Juno looks at Mark.

                                     VANESSA
                         How sure? Percentage-wise, would you 
                         say you're 80% sure, 90% sure?

               Mark seems visibly embarrassed by Vanessa's manic demeanor.

                                     JUNO
                         I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh really?

                                     JUNO
                         Look, if I could give it to you now, 
                         I would. But it probably looks like 
                         a Sea Monkey at this point, so I 
                         think we should leave it in there 
                         for a while until it gets cuter, you 
                         know?

                                     MAC
                         I think that's a great idea.

                                     MARK
                         That's great, right? Stellar news. 
                         Well, you guys drive safe, and we'll 
                         hear from you soon, all right?

                                     MAC
                         All right, take care of yourselves.

               Juno and Mac exit. Mark shuts the door. All is silent in the 
               foyer. Mark, Vanessa and Gerta stand motionless. Gerta pumps 
               her fist triumphantly, trying to create a mood of celebration.

                                     GERTA
                              (overly aggressive)
                         All RIGHT!

               Vanessa buries her head in her hands and weeps hoarsely.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING

               It is now WINTER. The TRACK TEAM jogs in formation, leaving 
               tracks in the snow. Those bastards never stop running.

               EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - DAY

               Bleeker is running alone on the track. His exhalations are 
               icy puffs in the air. Bleeker's friend VIJAY jogs up alongside 
               him. Vijay is a solemn, skinny boy, much like Bleeker.

                                     VIJAY
                         Hey man.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Oh, hey Vijay.

                                     VIJAY
                         Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yup.

                                     VIJAY
                         Just like our moms and teachers!

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yup.

                                     VIJAY
                         Did you hear it's yours?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yup.

                                     VIJAY
                         What a trip, man.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't really know anything about 
                         it.

                                     VIJAY
                         You should grow a moustache. You're 
                         a real man now.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I can't grow a moustache. It never 
                         comes in evenly.

                                     VIJAY
                         Me neither. But I'm going to stop 
                         wearing underpants in order to raise 
                         my sperm count. See you.

               VIJAY jogs off. Bleeker STOPS and wipes away his sweat.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - HEAD OFFICE - DAY

               We're looking over Juno's now FIVE MONTH PREGNANT BELLY to a 
               school administrator filling out a slip.

               Juno takes the slip, turns around and smiles all the way 
               out.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

               Juno exits the head office and bumps into Bleeker.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Hey Juno... A couple of us are going 
                         to the cineplex after school to donut 
                         that movie with the guy with eighteen 
                         kids.

                                     JUNO
                         Sorry, Bleek... Going for my 
                         ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Okay, cool.

                                     JUNO
                         I'll try to drop by later.

               INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

               SPLOOGE! We see ultrasound goo being squirted onto Juno's 
               exposed pregnant belly. An ULTRASOUND TECHNICIAN is using a 
               Doppler device to view the contents of her burgeoning bump. 
               Bren and Leah ooh and ahh at the resulting image.

               The tech takes measurements and types them into her database.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         That's the feet...

                                     ALL THREE
                         Oooh...

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         And there's a hand...

               The monitor reveals the baby's head.

                                     ALL THREE
                              (various)
                         Check that out... No way...

                                     BREN
                              (dreamily)
                         Would you look at that?

                                     LEAH
                         Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is 
                         scary!

                                     JUNO
                         Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've 
                         got in your belly is Taco Bell!

                                     LEAH
                         Touche.

                                     JUNO
                              (gazing at the monitor)
                         It is really weird looking. It's 
                         like it's not even real. I can't 
                         believe there are saps who actually 
                         cry at these things.

               Juno and Leah look at BREN, who is dabbing her eyes 
               discreetly.

                                     BREN
                         What? I'm not made of stone.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         Well, there we have it. Would you 
                         like to know the sex?

                                     LEAH
                         Aw, please Junebug?

                                     JUNO
                         No way. No, I definitely don't want 
                         to know.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         Planning to be surprised when you 
                         deliver?

                                     JUNO
                         I want Mark and Vanessa to be 
                         surprised, and if I know, I won't be 
                         able to keep myself from telling 
                         them and ruining the whole thing.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                              (condescending)
                         Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at 
                         school?

                                     JUNO
                         No, they're the people who are 
                         adopting the baby.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.

                                     BREN
                         Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         I just see a lot of teenage mothers 
                         come through here. It's obviously a 
                         poisonous environment for a baby to 
                         be raised in.

               Juno, Leah and Bren become immediately defensive.

                                     JUNO
                         How do you know I'm so poisonous? 
                         Like, what if the adoptive parents 
                         turn out to be evil molesters?

                                     LEAH
                         Or stage parents!

                                     BREN
                         They could be utterly negligent. 
                         Maybe they'll do a far shittier job 
                         of raising a kid than my dumbass 
                         stepdaughter ever would. Have you 
                         considered that?

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         No... I guess not.

                                     BREN
                         What is your job title, exactly?

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         Excuse me?

                                     BREN
                         I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

                                     BREN
                         Well I'm a nail technician, and I 
                         think we both ought to stick to what 
                         we know.

                                     ULTRASOUND TECH
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BREN
                         You think you're special because you 
                         get to play Picture Pages up there?

               Bren gestures to the ULTRASOUND MONITOR.

                                     BREN
                         My five year-old daughter could do 
                         that, and let me tell you, she is 
                         not the brightest bulb in the tanning 
                         bed. So why don't you go back to 
                         night school in Manteno and learn a 
                         real trade!

               The ULTRASOUND TECH exits in a huff.

                                     JUNO
                         Bren, you're a dick! I love it.

               INT. JUNO'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Juno lays in bed checking out the ULTRASOUND PRINT OUT.

               EXT. LORING NEIGHBORHOOD - PREVIA - AFTERNOON

               The Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa's 
               exclusive community. A sign on the gate reads "Glacial 
               Valley."

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - AFTERNOON

               Juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold.

               MARK answers the door, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.

                                     MARK
                         Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see 
                         you here.

                                     JUNO
                         I've got something really cool to 
                         show you guys. Is Vanessa here?

                                     MARK
                         No, she's working late tonight. She's 
                         trying to accrue some extra time off 
                         for when, you know...

               He gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly.

                         Right. I hear they can be kind of a 
                         time-suck.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Mark leads Juno into the kitchen, where he pours two drinks. 
               The STEREO blares in the background.

               She holds up a manila envelope.

                         Come on, you're going to want to sit 
                         down for this.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON

               As they move into the living room, Juno sits down and motions 
               for Mark to join her on the couch.

                                     JUNO
                         Park it, dude.

               Mark sits down. With great fanfare, Juno retrieves a dark, 
               glossy sheet from the envelope. It's her ULTRASOUND.

                                     JUNO
                         Behold, good sir! The very first 
                         photo of your future child.

                         You're kidding!

               Mark EXAMINES the ultrasound, baffled.

                                     JUNO
                         I think it kind of looks like my 
                         friend, Paulie.

                         No, he's the dad.

               Mark looks jolted, as if it's the first time he considered 
               that her baby might have a father. He stands up and holds 
               the photo up to the light critically.

                                     MARK
                         Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?

                         The doctor can tell, but I decided 
                         not to know. I want it to be a big 
                         surprise.

                                     MARK
                         Well, it can really only go two ways.

                         That's what you think. I drink tons 
                         of booze so you might get one of 
                         those scary neuter-babies that's

                         is forcing me to eat really healthy. 
                         She won't even let me stand in front 
                         of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. 
                         Hope you're ready.

               Mark chuckles.

                                     MARK
                         Wait...do you hear that?

               A new SONG has begun. Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and 
               walks toward the stereo. Juno follows him toward the source 
               of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is.

                                     JUNO
                         What is it?

                         It's only my favorite song. It's 
                         Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the 
                         Carpenters.

                         I've heard the Carpenters before. 
                         Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not 
                         unlike the White Stripes.

                         like this. Listen.

               Mark grabs the STEREO REMOTE off the kitchen counter and 
               turns up the volume to a roar. Mark and Juno stand in silence 
               in the kitchen. Mark mouths along with the lyrics.

                                     MARK

                         Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll 
                         rip a copy for you before you leave.

                         I didn't. But it's a three-way tie 
                         between the Stooges, Patti Smith and 
                         the Runaways.

                                     MARK
                         Yeah, I definitely need to make you 
                         some CDs. At least while my kid is 
                         hanging out in there.

               He gestures at Juno's burgeoning paunch.

               Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling 
               CD's. He's got a Carpenter's disc, the "No Alternative" 
               charity compilation, and Mother Love Bone.

               Juno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up.

                         Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. 
                         He's the ultimate master of horror.

                                     JUNO
                         Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate 
                         master of horror.

               Mark SWIVELS AROUND slowly on his desk chair, surprised.

                                     MARK
                         Argento's good, but Lewis is 
                         completely demented. We're talking 
                         buckets of goo. Red corn syrup 
                         everywhere. And fake brains up the 
                         yin-yang.

                         Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.

               Mark gives a look - "Oh, Really?"

               INT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON

               We see some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard 
               of Gore.

               Mark and Juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer 
               floats. They're sitting dangerously close on the sofa.

                         You've got decent taste in slasher 
                         movies, Mark.

               He raises his mug in a toast and Juno clinks it awkwardly.

                         for a girl.

                         My dad went through this phase where 
                         he was obsessed with Greek and Roman 
                         mythology. He named me after Zeus's 
                         wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, 
                         but I'm pretty sure Juno was his 
                         only wife. She was supposed to be 
                         really beautiful but really mean. 
                         Like Diana Ross.

               A door suddenly slams upstairs. Vanessa's home.

                         Nothing. She just hates when I sit 
                         around watching movies and 'not 
                         contributing.'

                                     JUNO
                         I'll handle this. I'm really good at 
                         diffusing mom-type rage.

               Juno jumps up and rushes out.

                                     MARK
                         Wait... aww, crap!

               INT. LORING HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Vanessa slides her BRIEFCASE off her shoulder and ventures 
               into the living room. She's struggling to carry some oversized 
               shopping bags.

                                     VANESSA
                         Mark? Are you home? I want to show 
                         you some things I picked up.

               Juno intercepts her breathlessly, clutching the ULTRASOUND 
               photo. Mark trails behind her.

                                     JUNO
                         Hi Vanessa!

               Vanessa JUMPS and makes a strangled sound.

                                     VANESSA
                         Juno! God, you startled me. What are 
                         you doing here? What's wrong?

                                     JUNO
                         Nothing...

                                     VANESSA
                         Then what's going on?

                                     JUNO
                         I went to the doctor today.

               Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios. 
               Her eyes are wide and she's uncharacteristically ruffled.

                                     VANESSA
                         Is the baby okay?

                                     JUNO
                         Sure. It's the right size and 
                         everything. I even saw its phalanges 
                         today! Check this...

               She holds the ULTRASOUND up to show Vanessa and drapes her 
               arm around her.

                                     VANESSA
                         What...

                                     JUNO
                         This is the baby. Your baby.

               Vanessa drops the shopping bags, sick with relief.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh my God...

                                     JUNO
                              (kindly)
                         Doesn't it look like it's waving? 
                         It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, 
                         Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"

                                     VANESSA
                         Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.

                                     MARK
                         Juno was nice enough to bring this 
                         by for us.

                                     JUNO
                         I came over as soon as I got that 
                         cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. 
                         My stepmom verbally abused the 
                         ultrasound tech so we were escorted 
                         off the premises.

                                     VANESSA
                              (distracted)
                         Oh, that's great!

               She can't divert her gaze from the photo.

                                     JUNO
                         See? Nothing to worry about.

               Vanessa chuckles tightly, clearly embarrassed by her show of 
               emotion.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY WAY - DAY

               Vanessa and Mark walk Juno out. Juno peers at some shopping 
               bags from various kids stores.

                                     JUNO
                         Hey, what kind of swag did you score?

                                     MARK
                         Yeah. Mall madness, huh?

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. 
                         For, you know, the baby. Babies need 
                         a lot of things. I want everything 
                         to be just right.

                                     JUNO
                         I thought people got all that stuff 
                         at baby showers. When my stepmom had 
                         my sister I remember she got about a 
                         million presents. They were all lame 
                         though, so I wasn't jealous.

                                     MARK
                         I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.

                                     JUNO
                         Why?

                                     VANESSA
                         Um, I think people are kind of unsure 
                         about the situation because it's 
                         not, you know, set in stone.

                                     JUNO
                         What do you mean? You mean...
                              (aghast)
                         Do you think I'm going to flake out 
                         on you?

                                     VANESSA
                         No, no, I don't think that, Juno. 
                         It's just that, we went through a 
                         situation before where it didn't 
                         work out.

               Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. Vanessa looks 
               embarrassed.

                                     MARK
                         Cold feet.

                                     JUNO
                         You should have gone to China. I 
                         heard they give away babies like 
                         free iPods. They shoot 'em out of 
                         those T-shirt guns at sports events.

                                     VANESSA
                              (abruptly)
                         Right. Well, Juno, your parents must 
                         be wondering where you are. You might 
                         want to head home.

                                     JUNO
                         Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they 
                         figure nothing worse could happen to 
                         me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was 
                         nice seeing you guys again.

               She waves and heads for the door.

                                     MARK
                              (to Juno)
                         Hey, don't forget your bag.

               Vanessa looks pain-stricken as Mark helps Juno with her bag.

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT

               Juno kicks the snow off her shoes before she enters.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Bren sits at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee and an 
               issue of Dog Fancy.

               Juno enters nonchalantly, drinking a giant slushie.

                                     BREN
                         Where the hell have you been, Junebug?

                                     JUNO
                         I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark 
                         and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I 
                         wound up staying for a couple of 
                         hours.

                                     BREN
                         A couple of hours? Why are you going 
                         up there in the first place?

                                     JUNO
                         They said they wanted to know about 
                         this stuff. They said to keep them 
                         updated, so I did!

                                     BREN
                         You could have sent it to them. Why 
                         would you drive an hour out to East 
                         Jesus, Nowhere?

                                     JUNO
                         I don't know, I just did. And while 
                         we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark 
                         and I watched The Wizard of Gore and 
                         he burned me some CDs of weird music. 
                         He's kind of cool.

               A beat as Bren absorbs this.

                                     BREN
                         That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a 
                         married stranger. You overstepped a 
                         boundary.

                                     JUNO
                         Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're 
                         the one overstepping boundaries. 
                         You're acting like you're the one 
                         who has to go through this and get 
                         huge and push a baby out of your vag 
                         for someone else. Besides, who cares 
                         if he's married? I can have friends 
                         who are married.

                                     BREN
                         It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You 
                         don't know squat about the dynamics 
                         of marriage.

                                     JUNO
                         You don't know anything about me!

                                     BREN
                         I know enough.

               Bren rises to leave, clutching the Dog Fancy magazine.

                                     JUNO
                              (gesturing to the 
                              magazine)
                         We don't even have a dog!

                                     BREN
                         Yeah, because you're allergic to 
                         their saliva. I've made a lot of 
                         sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a 
                         couple years you're going to move 
                         out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.

                                     JUNO
                         Wow, dream big!

                                     BREN
                         Oh, go fly a kite.

               Bren STORMS out. Juno heads to the URN by the door and 
               defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - NIGHT

               Juno parks her PREVIA on the street. She walks up to the 
               house and rings the doorbell.

               BLEEKER'S MOM answers, visibly annoyed. Her eyes drift down 
               to Juno's middle.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive 
                         once. But now she looks a hobbit. 
                         The fat one that was in The Goonies.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         Hi Juno. What can I do for you?

                                     JUNO
                         I borrowed Paulie's physics notes in 
                         school today. I'm pretty sure he 
                         needs them back, or his grade could 
                         plummet to an A minus.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         Fine. Come in.

               She steals another glance at Juno's belly.

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Bleeker's mom escorts Juno wordlessly up the stairs and down 
               the hallway to Paulie's bedroom. Juno discreetly tries to 
               charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her 
               from getting past Bleeker's mom. They share an extremely 
               awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway.

               Bleecker's mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker's 
               bedroom door. The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration 
               hanging on it that says PAULIE'S VRROOOM! It looks like 
               something a 5-year old might have.

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes, studying 
               like the tortured brainiac he is. Mrs. Bleeker opens the 
               bedroom door. Juno appears. Paulie jumps, startled.

                                     JUNO
                         Hey, don't concentrate so hard, man. 
                         I think I smell hair burning.

               Bleeker smiles faintly.

                                     BLEEKER'S MOM
                         Ten minutes.

               She closes the door halfway and leaves. Juno rolls her eyes 
               and pulls the door shut entirely.

                                     BLEEKER
                         What's up?

                                     JUNO
                         I just wanted to come over. You know, 
                         say hi. I miss hanging out with you 
                         on school nights.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I miss it too.

               He nervously cracks open a container of ORANGE TIC-TACS and 
               pours them into his mouth.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         Orange Tic-Tacs are Bleeker's one 
                         and only vice. When we made out, the 
                         day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted 
                         really tangy and delicious.

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - "MOLD-O'-RIFFIC" BASEMENT - NIGHT

               CU ON BLEEKER'S MOUTH AS HE KISSES JUNO FOR THE FIRST TIME

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - PAULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Bleeker glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed.

                                     BLEEKER
                         So, it looks like you're getting 
                         pregnant-er these days.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private 
                         adoption thing. These married people 
                         in Saint Cloud are going to be the 
                         parents.

               Bleeker is visibly relieved.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Really? What are they like?

                                     JUNO
                         The guy is super cool! His name is 
                         Mark and he's into old horror movies 
                         and he plays guitar. I actually hung 
                         out with him today.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Is that normal?

                                     JUNO
                         I asked my dad and Bren not to narc 
                         us out to your folks, so we should 
                         be safe.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Oh. That's a relief.

               Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker.

                                     JUNO
                         I'm going to really start looking 
                         like a dork soon. Will you still 
                         think I'm cute if I'm huge?

                                     BLEEKER
                         I always think you're cute. I think 
                         you're beautiful.

               Juno is caught off guard by his sincerity.

                                     JUNO
                         Jesus, Bleek.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Well, I do.

               The song playing ends, and another one begins. It's "the 
               song," the track that Bleeker and Juno both recognize from 
               the infamous night in the basement.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Hey Junebug, when all this is over 
                         we should get the band back together 
                         again.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new 
                         drumhead we should be good to go.

                                     BLEEKER
                         We could get back together too.

                                     JUNO
                         Were we together?

               Bleeker picks at the carpet, dejected.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Well, we were once. You know, that 
                         time.

                                     JUNO
                         What about Katrina De Voort? You 
                         could go out with Katrina De Voort.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't like Katrina.

                                     JUNO
                         I totally heard you did.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't. Katrina smells like soup. 
                         Her whole house smells of soup.

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - DAY

               The house is covered in fresh snow.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY

               Mark and Vanessa stand silently in the nursery. The walls 
               are primed slate gray. A single ANTIQUE ROCKING CHAIR sits 
               in the corner. Vanessa beams proudly and holds two paint 
               samples up near the wall.

                                     VANESSA
                         What do you think? Custard or 
                         Cheesecake?

                                     MARK
                         They're yellow.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, I wanted to pick something 
                         gender-neutral for now. Once we get 
                         the baby, God willing, we can create 
                         a more decisive palette.

                                     MARK
                         Why do people think yellow is gender-
                         neutral? I don't know one man with a 
                         yellow bedroom.

                                     VANESSA
                         I think I'm leaning toward Custard 
                         in this light. I don't know. I should 
                         paint a small area...

                                     MARK
                         Or you could just wait a couple 
                         months. It's not like the baby's 
                         going to storm in here any second 
                         and demand dessert-colored walls.

                                     VANESSA
                         What to Expect says that readying 
                         the baby's room is an important 
                         process for women. It's called 
                         "nesting."

                                     MARK
                         Nesting, huh? Are you planning to 
                         build the crib out of twigs and 
                         saliva?

                                     VANESSA
                         You should read the book. I even 
                         flagged the "daddy chapters" for 
                         you.

                                     MARK
                         I just think it's too early to paint. 
                         That's my opinion.

                                     VANESSA
                         And I disagree.

               Mark shrugs, resigned.

               Vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall.

                                     VANESSA
                         That wall is going to need something. 
                         Maybe we could put our first family 
                         picture there.

                                     MARK
                         Hm.

                                     VANESSA
                         Can you see it?

               Mark stares at the wall, looking lost.

               INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - DAY

               Juno and Leah are walking through the mall, looking bored. 
               Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of 
               actual maternity wear. Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel.

                                     LEAH
                         Yum. This pretzel tastes like a 
                         friggin' donut!

                                     JUNO
                         Share the love, Tits!

               She wrestles Leah for the pretzel. Onlookers stare at them, 
               appalled, as Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson.

                                     JUNO
                              (to eavesdroppers)
                         She's assaulting me! She's denying 
                         me fresh-baked goodness!

               Leah claps a hand over Juno's mouth.

                                     JUNO
                              (muffled)
                         Hly shht!

                                     LEAH
                         What?

               Juno drags Leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind 
               it. They're watching a group of well-heeled women and their 
               children shopping en masse. One of the women is pushing a 
               toddler in an ultramodern stroller. And one of the women is 
               VANESSA, looking vaguely detached.

                                     JUNO
                              (hushed)
                         That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.

                                     LEAH
                         Of the Penny Saver Lorings?

               Juno nods.

                                     LEAH
                         No way! She's pretty.

                                     JUNO
                         You sound shocked or something.

                                     LEAH
                         I just thought she'd look really old 
                         in real life.

               The women gather near a play area, sip Frapps and loudly 
               discuss their outfits for an upcoming party.

                                     WOMAN #1
                         And I was like, "No offense, sweetie, 
                         but nobody looks good in gauchos."

                                     WOMAN #2
                         Especially not with her build.

                                     JUNO
                              (mimicking the women, 
                              Peanuts-style)
                         Wah-wah-waaah!

               One of the little girls in the group tugs at Vanessa's sleeve. 
               Vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play 
               area and begins to play energetically with her.

               Juno watches intently, but Leah just snickers.

                                     LEAH
                         She's gonna steal that kid for her 
                         collection.

                                     JUNO
                         Right, seriously.

               They watch Vanessa for a few more moments. The other kids 
               wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore 
               them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children.

                                     LEAH
                         Bo-ring!

               Leah stands up. Juno lingers for a moment.

               INT. RIDGEDALE MALL - ELEVATOR BANK - A HALF HOUR LATER

               Leah and Juno approach the elevator.

                                     JUNO
                         I want a huge cookie. And like, a 
                         lamb kebob. Simultaneously.

                                     LEAH
                         God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

               The elevator door opens, revealing... Vanessa.

                                     VANESSA
                         Juno?

               Juno tries her best to look enthused.

                                     JUNO
                         Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to 
                         the mall today?

                                     VANESSA
                         Just, you know, shopping with my 
                         girlfriends.

                                     LEAH
                         You're gay?

               Juno glares at Leah.

                                     VANESSA
                              (confused)
                         No...

                                     JUNO
                         Please excuse Leah. She's mentally 
                         challenged.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?

                                     JUNO
                         Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. 
                         I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button 
                         now!

               She lifts her shirt and presses her popped-out NAVEL.

                                     VANESSA
                         That's great.

               Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces.

                                     JUNO
                         Dude, it's moshing all over.

               Vanessa looks confused.

                                     JUNO
                              (explains)
                         It's kicking.

               Vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the 
               courage for an unusual request.

                                     VANESSA
                         Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?

                                     JUNO
                         Are you kidding? Everyone at school 
                         is always grabbing at my belly. I'm 
                         like a legend. They call me the 
                         Cautionary Whale.

               She grabs Vanessa's hand and plants it on her stomach.

                                     VANESSA
                         I can't feel anything.

               Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby.

                                     VANESSA
                         It's not moving for me.

               She says this as though it's an admission of failure.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh, you should try talking to it. 
                         They can apparently hear speech in 
                         there, even though it sounds all ten 
                         thousands leagues under the sea.

               Vanessa kneels down next to the swell of Juno's belly.

                                     VANESSA
                         Hi. Hi, baby. It's me. My name is 
                         Vanessa. I can't wait to meet you.

               Leah gives a look to Juno as if she's about to barf.

                                     VANESSA
                         Can you hear me sweet angel?

               Vanessa looks like she's giving up hope. Then suddenly,

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!

                                     JUNO
                              (nods)
                         Elbow.

                                     VANESSA
                         Wow! It's magical.

               Juno smiles at Vanessa in awe of her genuine affection.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - MORNING

               The streets are covered in muddy, slushy snow. The mud is 
               instantly TRAMPLED underfoot by the collective feet of the 
               Dancing Elk Track Team on their morning run.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - BREN'S DESK - DAY

               Bren cuts the top three inches off a pair of Juno's jeans. 
               Then, using a sewing machine, begins attaching an elastic 
               waistband.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

               We're behind that same WAISTBAND, as Juno walks through the 
               students. Now, people seem to part the waters for the belly.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S "SPECIAL ROOM" - DAY

               Mark has the Les Paul on his lap as he stares at the boards 
               of an awful commercial.

               CU - THE SCRIPT (storyboards). A kitchen scene with a kid 
               eating a new breakfast product called -- BRUNCH BOWLZ.

               Annoyed and out of ideas, Mark begins an impromptu song...

                                     MARK
                         IF YOU'RE TIRED OF BREAKFAST 
                         BUT NOT HUNGRY FOR LUNCH, 
                         MICROWAVE YOURSELF 
                         A HEALTHY BOWL OF BRUNCH!

               Mark drops his head, dejected. Then, the phone rings.

                                     MARK
                              (picks up)
                         Hello?

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

                                     JUNO
                         So, I've been spending a lot of time 
                         listening to that weird CD you made 
                         me.

               Mark instantly smiles.

                                     MARK
                         Oh really? What's the verdict?

                                     JUNO
                         I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.

                                     MARK
                         Cute?

                                     JUNO
                         Well, when you're used to the raw 
                         power of Iggy and the Stooges, 
                         everything else sounds kind of 
                         precious by comparison.

                                     MARK
                         I imagine you have a collection of 
                         punk chestnuts to prove your point.

                                     JUNO
                         Consider it your musical education.

                                     MARK
                         I'm dying to see what you've got to 
                         teach me.

                                     JUNO
                         Okay, stop surfing porn and get back 
                         to work. Just wanted to say hi.

                                     MARK
                         Go learn something.

               Mark hangs up. Smiles.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

               CU on Juno's tray sliding along, picking up an odd combo of 
               pregnant food.

               Pull up to find Juno and Leah walking their trays to a table.

                                     LEAH
                         God, you're getting huge. How many 
                         months has it been now?

                                     JUNO
                         Almost eight. You wouldn't believe 
                         how weird I look naked.

                                     LEAH
                         I wish my funbags would get bigger.

                                     JUNO
                         Trust me, you don't. I actually have 
                         to wear a bra now. And I have to rub 
                         this nasty cocoa butter stuff all 
                         over myself or my skin could get 
                         stretched too far and explode.

                                     LEAH
                         Hot!

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

               Juno and Leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on 
               the wall, eating their lunch.

               Juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help 
               but glance her way. Some look derisive, others are amused.

                                     JUNO
                         God, why is everyone always staring 
                         at me?

                                     LEAH
                         Well, you are kind of... convex.

               She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach.

                                     JUNO
                         Wow, someone's been actually doing 
                         her geometry homework for once!

                                     LEAH
                         I don't have a choice. Keith's been 
                         grading me really hard lately.

                                     JUNO
                         Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers 
                         as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is 
                         already heightened these days.

                                     LEAH
                         Keith's hot.

                                     JUNO
                         Eww, he's all beardy!

               We see KEITH the teacher talking to some science kids in the 
               background. He has a Wild America beard. He lifts a cup of 
               coffee to his lips and slurps lustily.

               BACK ON JUNO AND LEAH:

                                     LEAH
                         Did you hear Bleek is going to prom 
                         with Katrina De Voort?

                                     JUNO
                         Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't 
                         like Katrina. It must be a pity date.

                                     LEAH
                              (shrugging)
                         He asked her. I heard they were going 
                         to Benihana, then the prom, then to 
                         Vijay's parents' cabin.

                                     JUNO
                         Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house 
                         reeks of soup!

                                     LEAH
                         Oh, it totally does. I was there for 
                         her birthday about four years ago 
                         and it was like Lipton Landing. But 
                         you know, boys have endured worse 
                         things for nookie.

                                     JUNO
                         There's no way in hell they're having 
                         sex or even holding hands.

                                     LEAH
                         I wouldn't be so sure about that. He 
                         did it with you. He's a man now.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're 
                         best friends.

                                     LEAH
                         Are you jealous? I thought you said 
                         you didn't care what he did.

                                     JUNO
                         I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I 
                         just know he doesn't like Katrina 
                         and I don't think he should toy with 
                         her emotions like that. She seems so 
                         nice and all.

                                     LEAH
                         Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.

                                     JUNO
                         Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once 
                         you're old enough to go, it's not 
                         cool anymore.

               INT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - BLEEKER'S LOCKER - DAY

               Bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker. Juno marches 
               up to him, belly leading the way.

                                     JUNO
                         Are you honestly and truly going to 
                         prom with Katrina De Voort?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Um, hi?

                                     JUNO
                         Leah just told me you were going 
                         with her.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to 
                         go. A bunch of us from the team are 
                         going to Benihana, then the prom, 
                         then Vijay's parents' cabin.

               Juno is clearly AFFRONTED.

                                     BLEEKER
                              (meekly)
                         We're getting a stretch limo.

                                     JUNO
                         Your mom must be really glad you're 
                         not taking me.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You're mad. Why are you mad?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great 
                         mood. Despite the fact that I'm 
                         trapped in a fat suit I can't take 
                         off, despite the fact that everyone 
                         is making fun of me behind my back, 
                         despite the fact that your little 
                         girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in 
                         art class yesterday...

                         Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I 
                         doubt she was actually giving you 
                         the stinkeye. She just looks like 
                         that all the time.

               A GIRL strides past (obviously KATRINA) with a sour look 
               aimed squarely at Juno.

                                     JUNO
                         Whatever. Have fun at the prom with 
                         Soupy Sales. I'm sure I can think of 
                         something way more cool to do that 
                         night. Like I could pumice my feet, 
                         or go to Bren's dumb Unitarian church, 
                         or get hit by a ten-ton truck full 
                         of hot garbage juice. All those things 
                         would be exponentially cooler than 
                         going to the prom with you.

               She starts to walk away.

               Bleeker takes a deep breath.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You're being really immature.

                                     JUNO
                              (turning around)
                         What?

               Bleeker BRACES himself and pushes up his lab goggles.

                                     JUNO
                         That's not how our thing works! I 
                         hurl the accusations and you talk me 
                         down, remember?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Not this time. You don't have any 
                         reason to be mad at me. You broke my 
                         heart. I should be royally ticked at 
                         you, man. I should be really cheesed 
                         off. I shouldn't want to talk to you 
                         anymore.

                                     JUNO
                         Why? Because I got bored and had sex 
                         with you one day, and then I didn't, 
                         like, marry you?

                                     BLEEKER
                         Like I'd marry you! You would be the 
                         meanest wife of all time. And anyway, 
                         I know you weren't bored that day 
                         because there was a lot of stuff on 
                         TV. The Blair Witch Project was on 
                         Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I 
                         want to watch this, but we should 
                         make out instead. La la la."

                                     JUNO
                         Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the 
                         Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure 
                         you guys will have a really bitchin' 
                         time!

                                     BLEEKER
                              (searching for a 
                              comeback)
                         Yeah, well... I still have your 
                         underwear.

                                     JUNO
                         I still have your virginity!

                                     BLEEKER
                              (looking around, 
                              panicked)
                         Oh my God, SHUT UP!

                                     JUNO
                         What? Are you ashamed that we did 
                         it?

                                     BLEEKER
                         No...

                                     JUNO
                         Well at least you don't have to walk 
                         around with the evidence under your 
                         sweater. I'm a planet!

               Juno picks up her BACKPACK dejectedly and slides it over her 
               shoulder. She's about to walk away, when...

                                     BLEEKER
                         Wait, let me take that.

                                     JUNO
                         Huh?

                                     BLEEKER
                         You shouldn't be carrying that heavy 
                         bag. I'll take it.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh. It's fine. What's another ten 
                         pounds?

               She turns around, wipes TEARS off her cheek (making sure no 
               one sees) and continues down the hallway.

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - PREVIA - DAY

               Juno climbs ungracefully into the van. She starts the engine, 
               then pauses to dig through her backpack for something. She 
               produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview 
               mirror, examining herself self-consciously. She puts on some 
               Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker and backs out of the driveway.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - MARK'S SPECIAL ROOM - DAY

               Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie 
               website. He has the blank expression of a bored obsessive. 
               The doorbell rings.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY

               Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly 
               knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. Mark breaks into a 
               grin.

                                     MARK
                         Wow. That shirt is working hard.

                                     JUNO
                              (furtive)
                         Is Vanessa here?

                                     MARK
                         Nope. We're safe.

               He and Juno smile conspiratorially.

                                     JUNO
                         Cool.

                                     MARK
                         Come on, I have something for you.

               He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

               The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and 
               unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain 
               to illuminate a bare bulb.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? 
                         It's beautiful!

                                     MARK
                         Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my 
                         old comics down here, and I want to 
                         show you one of them.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh God, you're one of those guys...

                                     MARK
                         You're gonna like this, I promise.

               Mark RUMMAGES through a cardboard box in the corner.

                                     MARK
                              (extracting a bagged 
                              COMIC from the box)
                         Here it is.

               He shows the COMIC to Juno. It's called "Most Fruitful Yuki." 
               It depicts a pregnant JAPANESE GIRL kicking ass and taking 
               names.

                                     JUNO
                         "Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh 
                         my god, she's a pregnant superhero!

                                     MARK
                         Isn't that great? I got it when I 
                         was in Japan with my band. She reminds 
                         me of you.

               Juno examines the comic. "Most Fruitful Yuki" does resemble 
               her.

                                     JUNO
                         Wow, I actually feel like less of a 
                         fat dork now.

                                     MARK
                         Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. 
                         You should be proud to be the same 
                         condition.

               She throws a KARATE KICK in Mark's direction with a KEE-YA!

               Juno is sincerely pleased.

                                     JUNO
                         Okay, how about some tunes?

               There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno 
               kneels down and pops in one of the discs.

                                     JUNO
                         Now this first one is kinda slow. 
                         But it's Mott the Hoople so it's 
                         still totally rad and hardcore.

               Juno puts in the CD and "All The Young Dudes" fills the room.

               Mark Laughs.

                                     JUNO
                         What?

                                     MARK
                         I actually know this one.

                                     JUNO
                         You do?

                                     MARK
                         Yeah, this song's older than me, if 
                         you can believe that. I danced to it 
                         at my senior prom.

                                     JUNO
                         That's almost interesting, Mark. Who 
                         did you dance with?

                                     MARK
                         Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she 
                         was a good dance partner. Even let 
                         me put my hands on her butt.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh man, I can just picture you slow 
                         dancing like a dork!

               She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves 
               back and forth stiffly.

                                     MARK
                         No, I put my hands on your waist. 
                         Then you put your arms around my 
                         neck. That's how we did it in '88.

               Mark puts his hands on what remains of Juno's waist. She 
               drapes her arms around his neck self-consciously.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh, okay. Like this.

                                     MARK
                         You've never been to a dance, have 
                         you?

                                     JUNO
                              (casually defensive)
                         Only squares and nerds go to dances.

                                     MARK
                         What are you?

                                     JUNO
                         I don't know.

               They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against 
               Mark.

                                     MARK
                         I feel like there's something between 
                         us.

               They laugh.

               Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence 
               for a few moments, then stop moving. Mark pulls Juno as close 
               as he possibly can, given her expanding girth.

                                     MARK
                         I'm leaving Vanessa.

                                     JUNO
                              (quiet at first)
                         What?

                                     MARK
                         It's just not working out, but I'm 
                         getting my own place in the city... 
                         and I've got it all planned out. 
                         It's something I've wanted to do for 
                         a long time...

               Juno backs away.

                                     JUNO
                              (growing)
                         No.

                                     MARK
                         No?

                                     JUNO
                         No. No, you definitely cannot do 
                         that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack 
                         of no!

                                     MARK
                         What's the matter?

                                     JUNO
                         This isn't what we agreed on. You 
                         guys have to take care of... this! 
                         You are the chosen custodians of the 
                         big-ass bump!

               She GESTURES wildly to her belly. Suddenly, something matters 
               to her far more than the approval of an older guy.

                                     MARK
                         But I thought you'd be cool if...

                                     JUNO
                              (interrupting)
                         I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. 
                         I wanted everything to be perfect. 
                         Not shitty and broken like everyone 
                         else's family. Listen, once I have 
                         the baby, Vanessa is going to finally 
                         be happy, and everything will be all 
                         right. Believe me on this one!

                                     MARK
                         A baby is not going to fix everything. 
                         Besides, I don't know if I'm ready 
                         to be a father.

                                     JUNO
                              (aghast)
                         But you're old!

                                     MARK
                         I... How do you think of me, Juno? 
                         Why are you here?

                                     JUNO
                         I don't know. I just liked being 
                         your friend. I sort of liked becoming 
                         furniture in your weird life.

                                     MARK
                         This...
                              (he gestures to the 
                              dank surrounding 
                              room)
                         ...this is what my life has become. 
                         Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. 
                         Is that so appealing to you?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? 
                         Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?

                                     MARK
                         That's not the point. We're just not 
                         in love anymore.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa 
                         when you married her? If you love 
                         someone once, you can love them again, 
                         I know it. My friend Leah has gone 
                         out with the same guy, like, four 
                         times. You're just not trying.

               Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl.

                                     MARK
                         I'm such an idiot. I can't believe 
                         what an idiot I am.

               He paces over to the wall and KICKS it softly.

                                     JUNO
                         Please don't get a divorce! God, 
                         Mark, just do me a solid and stay 
                         with your wife.

                                     MARK
                         God, you're so young.

                                     JUNO
                         Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old 
                         enough to tell when people are acting 
                         like total a-holes!

               Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at 
               Mark.

                                     JUNO
                         Oh and by the way, I bought another 
                         Sonic Youth album and it's the worst 
                         thing I've ever heard! It's just 
                         noise, man!

               She bolts up the stairs, sobbing.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the 
               front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning 
               home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased 
               NURSING PILLOW. They nearly collide.

                                     VANESSA
                         Juno? What's going on?

                                     JUNO
                         Nothing.

               It's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's 
               lying. Vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries 
               her hardest to seem serene and "together" in front of Juno.

                                     VANESSA
                              (pretending to be 
                              calm)
                         Mark? Why is Juno crying?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine 
                         home furnishings. See you later.

               She rushes toward the door.

                                     VANESSA
                         Hold on.

               Juno halts.

                                     VANESSA
                         Juno, what's the matter?

                                     MARK
                         She's hormonal. Right, June? It's 
                         just part of the whole process.

               Juno looks totally betrayed. She doesn't respond. Vanessa 
               looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying.

                                     VANESSA
                         What did you do?

                                     MARK
                         I didn't do anything... I just... 
                         I've just been thinking.

                                     VANESSA
                              (you've been thinking?)
                         What?

                                     MARK
                         Just thinking if this is really the 
                         right thing for us.

                                     VANESSA
                         What are you referring to?

               She knows exactly to what he's referring.

                                     MARK
                         I've been just wondering if we're, 
                         you know, ready.

                                     VANESSA
                         Of course we're ready. We've taken 
                         all the classes. The nursery. The 
                         books --

                                     MARK
                         I know we're prepared. I just don't 
                         know if... I'm ready.

               Juno's face continues to fall. Vanessa notices.

                                     VANESSA
                              (to Juno)
                         Juno, don't worry about this. He 
                         just has cold feet. That's how boys 
                         are. The books all say the same thing. 
                         A woman becomes a mother when she 
                         gets pregnant. A man becomes a father 
                         when he sees his baby. He's going to 
                         get there. He'll get there.

               Juno ain't buying it.

                                     VANESSA
                              (to Mark)
                         Why don't we let Juno go home and we 
                         can discuss this later on, okay?

                                     MARK
                         It all just happened so fast. We put 
                         that ad in the paper. I thought it 
                         would take months if, you know, ever 
                         and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, 
                         she's in our living room.

                                     VANESSA
                              (quietly)
                         She answered our prayers.

                                     MARK
                              (ignores the comment)
                         Ever since, it's just been like a 
                         ticking clock.

               This stops Vanessa. Juno looks offended.

                                     VANESSA
                         What are you saying?

               A long hideous beat.

                                     MARK
                         It just feels a little like bad 
                         timing.

               Another hideous beat.

                                     VANESSA
                         What would be a good time for you?

                                     MARK
                         I don't know. There's just things I 
                         still want to do.

                                     VANESSA
                         Like what? Be a rock star?

                                     MARK
                         Don't mock me.

               Vanessa sighs. It's done.

                                     VANESSA
                         You're trying to do something that's 
                         never going to happen. And you know 
                         what? Your shirt is stupid. Grow up. 
                         If I have to wait for you to become 
                         Kurt Cobain, I'm never going to be a 
                         mother.

               Vanessa looks defeated.

                                     MARK
                         I never said I'd be a great father.

               We hear the front door closing. Vanessa and Mark look over 
               and notice that Juno has escaped the conflict.

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - AFTERNOON

               Juno runs up to her car sobbing. She struggles with the keys, 
               but finally makes it into the Previa and drives off.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

               The Previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the 
               shoulder.

               INT. PREVIA - AFTERNOON

               Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for 
               the first time since she became pregnant.

               After a beat, she begins to gather herself.

               INT. BLEEKER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar. 
               He's playing a theme that we will soon recognise.

               EXT. CORNER STORE - NIGHT

               Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. 
               We push in close... when she gets an idea.

               She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she 
               finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and 
               pulls out a pen, ready to write something... a note?

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - NIGHT

               It's quiet after the storm. Inside, we see Vanessa sitting 
               alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of 
               wine.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events 
               sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join 
               her.

                                     MARK
                         I called Gerta Rauss. She says she 
                         can represent both of us. They call 
                         it "collaborative divorce." It's 
                         apparently all the rage right now. 
                         And it's easy because we don't have 
                         children.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, it's fine. Thanks for making the 
                         call, I guess.

               Mark nods and sits down.

                                     VANESSA
                         We're actually, finally doing this?

                                     MARK
                         Looks like it, yeah.

                                     VANESSA
                         Have you found a place to stay?

                                     MARK
                         Yeah, downtown.

                                     VANESSA
                         A hotel?

                                     MARK
                         It's a loft.

                                     VANESSA
                              (lightly teasing)
                         Aren't you the cool guy?

               They STARE at the wall, speechless and defeated.

                                     VANESSA
                         I wanted a baby so bad. So bad.

               She buries her head in her hands.

                                     MARK
                         I know you did.

               There's a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.

               EXT. LORING HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT

               Mark opens the door. There's a folded piece of paper sitting 
               on the doormat. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the 
               van.

               Mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper -- it takes a minute 
               because of Juno's proficiency in "teen girl origami." He 
               holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back.

                                     MARK
                         It looks like a bill from Jiffy-Lube.

               Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, 
               examining it.

                                     VANESSA
                         It's for me.

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - NIGHT

               Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. A porch light's 
               been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         I never realize how much I like being 
                         home unless I've been somewhere really 
                         different for a while.

               She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch 
               and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly 
               with it. Then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family 
               finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes.

               Juno enters.

                                     JUNO
                         Hi Dad.

                                     MAC
                         Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. 
                         Where have you been?

                                     JUNO
                         Dealing with stuff way beyond my 
                         maturity level. Where is everyone?

                                     MAC
                         Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot 
                         ice skating class.

                                     JUNO
                         Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. 
                         Liberty Bell's still getting the 
                         hang of stairs.

                                     MAC
                         No, but you know Bren. She dreams 
                         big.

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, she does.

                                     MAC
                         You look a little morose, honey. 
                         What's eating you?

                                     JUNO
                         I'm losing my faith in humanity.

                                     MAC
                         Think you can narrow it down for me.

                                     JUNO
                         I guess I wonder sometimes if people 
                         ever stay together for good.

                                     MAC
                         You mean like couples?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah, like people in love.

                                     MAC
                         Are you having boy trouble? I gotta 
                         be honest; I don't much approve of 
                         you dating in your condition, 
                         'cause... well, that's kind of messed 
                         up.

                                     JUNO
                         Dad, no!

                                     MAC
                         Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't 
                         that what you girls call it? Skanky? 
                         Skeevy?

                                     JUNO
                         Please stop now.

                                     MAC
                              (persisting)
                         Tore up from the floor up?

                                     JUNO
                         Dad, it's not about that. I just 
                         need to know that it's possible for 
                         two people to stay happy together 
                         forever. Or at least for a few years.

                                     MAC
                         It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, 
                         I may not have the best track record 
                         in the world, but I have been with 
                         your stepmother for ten years now, 
                         and I'm proud to say that we're very 
                         happy.

               Juno nods in agreement.

                                     MAC
                         In my opinion, the best thing you 
                         can do is to find a person who loves 
                         you for exactly what you are. Good 
                         mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, 
                         handsome, what have you, the right 
                         person will still think that the sun 
                         shines out your ass. That's the kind 
                         of person that's worth sticking with.

               A wave of REALIZATION crosses Juno's face.

                                     JUNO
                         I sort of already have.

                                     MAC
                         Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You 
                         know I'll always be there to love 
                         and support you, no matter what kind 
                         of pickle you're in.

               He nods toward her belly.

                                     MAC
                         Obviously.

               Juno laughs and hugs her father, planting a smooch on his 
               cheek.

                                     JUNO
                         I need to go out somewhere for just 
                         a little while. I don't have any 
                         homework, and I swear I'll be back 
                         by ten.

               She salutes and dashes out of the kitchen.

                                     MAC
                         You were talking about me, right?

               MONTAGE:

               INT. BLEEKER HOUSE - BLEEKER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               We push in over Bleeker sleeping in his car-bed towards the 
               window. We look out onto the lawn to find Juno and Leah 
               running back to the Previa, hopping in, and screeching off.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - MORNING

               Bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early-morning 
               run. He looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the 
               stoop: "BLEEKER -- CHECK THE MAIL."

               He walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch 
               on the mailbox.

               At least one hundred containers of ORANGE TIC TACS come 
               pouring out in an colorful deluge. They spill out onto the 
               driveway. Bleeker smiles.

               EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - MORNING

               Juno waddles toward the field. The guys on the track team, 
               ridiculously arrayed as usual, are doing hurdler stretches. 
               They stare at her quizzically. Bleeker spots Juno approaching 
               and jogs up to the chainlink fence.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Did you put like a hundred things of 
                         Tic Tacs in my mailbox?

                                     JUNO
                         Yeah. That was me.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Why?

                                     JUNO
                              (blushes)
                         Because they're your fave. And you 
                         can never have too much of your 
                         favorite one-calorie breath mint.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty 
                         much set until college on the Tic 
                         Tac front.

                                     JUNO
                         You know, I've been thinking. I'm 
                         really sorry I was such a huge bitch 
                         to you. You didn't deserve that. You 
                         never deserve any of the poo I unload 
                         on you.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You know it's okay.

                                     JUNO
                         Also, I think I'm in love with you.

                                     BLEEKER
                         What, you mean as friends?

                                     JUNO
                         No, for real. I think you are the 
                         coolest person I've ever met. And 
                         you don't even have to try.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I try really hard, actually...

                                     JUNO
                         No, you're naturally smart. You always 
                         think of the funniest things to do. 
                         Remember when you passed me that 
                         postcard during Spanish class, and 
                         it was addressed like, "Junebug 
                         MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the 
                         Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having 
                         fun in Barcelona -- wish you were 
                         here"? That was hilarious.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I was just bored. I only think school 
                         is awesome like, 80% of the time.

                                     JUNO
                         Plus, you're the only person who 
                         doesn't stare at my stomach all the 
                         fucking time. You actually look at 
                         my face. And every time I look at 
                         you, the baby starts kicking me super 
                         hard.

                                     BLEEKER
                         It does?

               Juno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Wizard!

                                     JUNO
                         I think it's because my heart starts 
                         pounding when I see you.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Mine too.

                                     JUNO
                         Basically, I'm completely smitten 
                         with you, and I don't care if I'm 
                         making an ass out of myself right 
                         now, because you've seen me make an 
                         ass out of myself a million times, 
                         and you still want to be my friend.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Well, yeah. You're the best friend 
                         I've ever had, even when you're being 
                         kind of evil.

                                     JUNO
                         That's all I need from you. That's 
                         more than I could ever ask for. You're 
                         just golden, dude.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Can we make out now?

                                     JUNO
                         Okay.

               Bleeker and Juno KISS, oblivious to the gawking track team 
               guys in the background.

               In the distance, near the school entrance, we see STEVE 
               RENDAZO (the kid who always TORMENTS Juno) regarding the 
               makeout session with a sad, envious expression.

               LEAH passes by, does a double take, then hurries up to the 
               fence, rolling her eyes.

                                     LEAH
                              (disgusted)
                         You know, you can go into early labor 
                         sucking face like that!

               Juno gives her the FINGER, not breaking the clinch with 
               Bleeker.

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - JUNO'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Juno is lying on her back on the bed, staring at the ceiling. 
               She's more pregnant than we've ever seen her. She revs a 
               Matchbox car against the slope of her belly and lets it roll. 
               Juno suddenly sits up, looking thoroughly freaked. She pats 
               her lap frantically and jumps off the bed.

                                     JUNO
                         Dad!

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. MACGUFF HOUSE - MAC'S WORK DESK - SAME

               Mac looks up from the lure he's working on.

                                     MAC (O.S.)
                         What?!

                                     JUNO
                         Either I just pissed my pants or...

                                     MAC (O.S.)
                         Or...

                                     JUNO
                         Thundercats are go!

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY

               Mac, Bren and Liberty Bell rush out of the house. They pile 
               into the Previa at breakneck speed. Juno waddles behind them, 
               protesting.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               CU of Juno wearing a puffy surgical cap. She's being pushed 
               down the hospital corridor in a wheelchair. She bursts into 
               giggles. Pull back to reveal her that Leah is pushing her 
               rather aggressively. Leah jokingly steers the wheelchair 
               into a wall. Juno feigns whiplash.

               Bren appears behind them and orders Juno out of the 
               wheelchair, exasperated. She pulls off Juno's surgical cap. 
               Leah and Juno snicker.

               INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY

               We see Juno is in a BIRTHING SUITE at the hospital, pacing 
               impatiently, bent over in obvious discomfort. She's wearing 
               her Chuck Taylors and knee socks with her hospital gown. 
               Leah and Bren stand nearby.

               Juno doubles over in pain.

                                     JUNO
                              (panicked)
                         Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I 
                         get that Spinal Tap thing?

                                     BREN
                         It's called a spinal block, and you 
                         can't have it yet, honey. The doctor 
                         said you're not dilated enough.

                                     JUNO
                         You mean I have to wait for it to 
                         get even worse? Why can't they just 
                         give it to me now?

                                     BREN
                         Well, honey, doctors are sadists who 
                         like to play God and watch lesser 
                         people scream.

               Juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain.

                                     BREN
                              (checking her watch)
                         Shit.
                              (To the doctor)
                         Hey, can we give my kid the damn 
                         spinal tap already?

               INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - LATER

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         It really didn't hurt that bad having 
                         him.

               We see Juno in the process of delivery, from her POV. Leah 
               holds one of Juno's feet and Bren holds the other.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         The best part was when I peed on 
                         Leah during labor.

               We see Leah holding Juno's FOOT, which is shaking. Leah's 
               shirt is soaked. She rolls her eyes and mouths "Fuck you" at 
               Juno. Juno's raised MIDDLE FINGER enters the frame.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         And then, out of nowhere, there it 
                         was...

               The doctor reveals JUNO'S BABY BOY above the sheet.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         There he was.

               Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to 
               flutter... and she passes out.

               EXT. DANCING ELK SCHOOL - TRACK - AFTERNOON

               Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him 
               on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the 
               bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate 
               Vijay looks on. Bleeker's mom is seated near Vijay, holding 
               a video camera.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         I decided to not call Bleeker to 
                         tell him that I was having the baby. 
                         He had a big meet against Manteno 
                         and I didn't want him to get all 
                         worried about me and choke.

               Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. The fifteen or so 
               people in attendance cheer.

                                     VIJAY
                              (admiringly)
                         His legs are as swift as his seed.

                                     MRS. BLEEKER
                         What did you say?

               Bleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         P. Bleeker has just broken a district 
                         record in the 400.

               Bleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno.

               She's not there.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         But he figured it out anyway.

               Bleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without 
               stopping to explain. His mother stands up, confused.

               INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - DAY

               A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and 
               gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby.

               The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator.

                                     NURSE
                         Would you like to meet your son?

               Pull back to reveal she's speaking to VANESSA, who stands, 
               paralyzed, several feet away.

                                     VANESSA
                         I have a son?

                                     NURSE
                              (amused)
                         You are the adoptive mother?

                                     VANESSA
                         I have a son.

                                     NURSE
                         Healthy kid, too. Didn't waste any 
                         time getting out.

               Vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in 
               her eyes. She spends a few moments just looking at him.

               She feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a Bren 
               leaning against the doorway.

               Vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously.

                                     VANESSA
                         How do I look?

                                     BREN
                              (gently)
                         Like a mom. Scared shitless.

               Vanessa laughs.

               INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY

               Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth 
               is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and 
               accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared 
               out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's 
               not sure what to say.

               He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game, 
               but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His 
               expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained.

                                     MAC
                         Someday, you'll be back here, honey. 
                         On your terms.

               Juno nods and swallows.

               Over Mac's shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway. 
               It's Bleeker in his track uniform.

               Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. Mac glances 
               at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac clears his 
               throat, gets up and leaves the room.

               Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his 
               arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for 
               the first time in months.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BIRTHING SUITE - EVENING

               Juno lies on the bed. She looks rested and relaxed compared 
               to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and 
               swollen. Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track 
               uniform and spikes.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         Bleeker decided he didn't want to 
                         see the baby. Neither did I, really. 
                         He didn't feel like ours.

               INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING

               We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her 
               eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         I think he was always hers.

               INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY

               The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa's immaculate 
               taste. Nothing looks as though it's been touched. We see the 
               antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         It ended with a chair.

               We pan past the wall Vanessa had said "needed something." 
               There's a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was 
               handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it 
               says: "Vanessa -- If you're still in, I'm still in. Juno."

               We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We 
               see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her 
               shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa 
               looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There 
               are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed 
               close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the 
               baby for a single moment.

               The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb. Vanessa glows 
               with an expression of pure bliss.

               EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY

               It's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle 
               out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who 
               is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost 
               as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby.

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY

               Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar 
               is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not 
               pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older.

                                     JUNO (V.O.)
                         As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is 
                         totally boss. He is the cheese to my 
                         macaroni. I know people are supposed 
                         to fall in love before they reproduce, 
                         but normalcy's not really our style.

               As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she 
               passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in 
               outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.

               Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning 
               his guitar.

               EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAY

               Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles 
               and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and 
               pulls the pick out of the strings.

                                     JUNO
                         Ready?

               Bleeker nods.

               Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "Anyone Else 
               But You," by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first 
               their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You're a part time lover and a 
                         fulltime friend. The monkey on your 
                         back is the latest trend. I don't 
                         see what anyone can see, in anyone 
                         else but you.

                                     JUNO
                         Here is the church and here is the 
                         steeple. We sure are cute for two 
                         ugly people. I don't see what anyone 
                         can see, in anyone else but you.

                                     BLEEKER
                         We both have shiny happy fits of 
                         rage. You want more fans, I want 
                         more stage. I don't see what anyone 
                         can see, in anyone else but you.

                                     JUNO
                         You are always trying to keep it 
                         real. I'm in love with how you feel. 
                         I don't see what anyone can see, in 
                         anyone else but you.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I kiss you on the brain in the shadow 
                         of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, 
                         my body's swinging from side to side. 
                         I don't see what anyone can see, in 
                         anyone else but you.

                                     JUNO
                         The pebbles forgive me, the trees 
                         forgive me. So why can't you forgive 
                         me? I don't see what anyone can see, 
                         in anyone else but you.

                                     JUNO AND BLEEKER TOGETHER
                         Du du du du du du dudu. Du du du du 
                         du du dudu. I don't see what anyone 
                         can see, in anyone else but you.

               She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile 
               ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.

               Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with 
               life and summer activity.

               FADE IN:

               INT. VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY

               CLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15.

               The credits begin to roll.

               Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in 
               preparation for a formal reception.

               Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier.

               Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery.

               Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Kitchen clock strikes 2:15.

               Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere.

               Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with 
               decorative garnish.

               Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting 
               enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey, 
               pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and 
               flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering, 
               sour look.

               The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared 
               silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet 
               throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing 
               a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The 
               valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt.

               The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK.

               Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, 
               selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From 
               beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A 
               weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit.

               EXT. ESTATE - DAY

               The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a 
               dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon, 
               he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He 
               sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.

               In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the 
               estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows.

               INT. HALLWAY - EVENING

               Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly 
               scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. 
               Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling 
               the staff to clean up the mess.

               SERIES OF CLOSE UPS

               Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations.

               A bird sits listless in a gilded cage.

               Hot water is poured into a bath.

               Carriages begin to arrive.

               Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play.

               Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror.

               He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat 
               of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens 
               a corset around his mid-section from behind.

               Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored.

               He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver 
               saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch 
               himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry.

               He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet 
               sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold 
               thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and 
               saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror.

               Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his 
               hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.

               CLOSE UP

               Fine linen undervest slides over his head.

               Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist.

               The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar.

               A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand.

               A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck.

               An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails 
               to the knees is fitted to his torso.

               His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted.

               His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb.

               His cheeks are pinched.

               A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel.

               Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He 
               raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a 
               waffle:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You dance like a herd of cattle, 
                         Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman 
                         who lights up the room... simply by 
                         leaving it.

               He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO, 
               a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold 
               in the looking glass.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join 
                         us downstairs after completing this 
                         one-sided flash of wit?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle 
                         Otto. No one really listens to anyone 
                         else. If you attempt it, you will 
                         see why.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         You judge everything too severely. I 
                         wonder what would happen if you were 
                         to cast that critical eye inward?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You do not wonder at all. You merely 
                         ask in order to state your own 
                         opinion.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         We are all concerned about you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Ahh, here it comes.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         Your life does not seem to have any 
                         direction. At the age of 25 a man is 
                         too young to do anything well. At 35 
                         he is too old. Now is your time to 
                         take action. Tell me, what is it you 
                         want to DO with your life?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (wearily)
                         I do not know.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                              (just as weary)
                         Your ignorance cramps my conversation.
                              (he slaps Leopold's 
                              face twice rather 
                              quickly)
                         Wake up! This is your one and only 
                         life. Every man has the chance to 
                         make a difference. DO something!

               Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I am most grateful for your 
                         surveillance and for your sympathy. 
                         I assure you there is no need for 
                         concern. I am as effectual and 
                         attentive... as my position allows.

                                     UNCLE OTTO
                         Life is not position, Leopold. It is 
                         action.
                              (he straightens 
                              Leopold's tie)
                         I will see you downstairs promptly. 
                         In the appropriate frame of mind.

               He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. 
               The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. 
               Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher.

               Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He 
               hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally...

                                     THE VALET
                              (grandly)
                         Go spread joy.

               Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.

               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

               Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian 
               society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance 
               card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is 
               MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting 
               God.

               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

               A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically 
               into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly 
               SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking.

               Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing 
               suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out 
               of frame.

               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

               Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of 
               19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away 
               shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows 
               into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams 
               up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky 
               teeth.

               Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.

               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

               Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of 
               immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he 
               maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except 
               her enormous bosom.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You dance like an angel, Miss 
                         Fairchild. You light up the room. I 
                         thank you.

               Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card, 
               sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders.

               He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She 
               scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. 
               Hiding his dance card, he saunters over.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good evening. I do not believe I 
                         have had the pleasure.

               The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes 
               he is addressing her. She puts her pad away.

                                     CARLSON
                         ...Julia Carlson.

               Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.

                                     CARLSON
                         I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (slightly tipsy)
                         You are not from the area, are you?

                                     CARLSON
                              (smiles and shakes 
                              her head "No")
                         Are you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is my estate.

                                     CARLSON
                         Really?
                              (looking around the 
                              room)
                         Well it's not home but it's much...

               Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There 
               is a hubbub amongst the guests.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.

                                     CARLSON
                         The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't 
                         it?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is a scandal nonetheless.

               Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss Carlson, do me the honor?

                                     CARLSON
                         I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (smiling seductively)
                         Truly I would be in your debt. Any 
                         admonition would be erased simply by 
                         presenting a partner as lovely as 
                         yourself.

                                     CARLSON
                         No, no. Really, I...

               Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck, 
               takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor.

               They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing "TA-RA-RA-
               BOOM-DE-AY." Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson, 
               shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I suppose we really ought to sing 
                         along.

                                     CARLSON
                              (embarrassed)
                         Oh, golly.

               They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their 
               emphasis on "BOOM." Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes 
               freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:

                                     CARLSON
                              (breathless)
                         Thank you for the dance. It was 
                         lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful 
                         for you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Not at all. It was most enlightening.

               There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes 
               midnight.

                                     CARLSON
                         I really must be going.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I won't hear of it.

                                     CARLSON
                              (moving away from him)
                         No, I'm quite late as it is.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I shall see you to the door...

                                     CARLSON
                              (stopping him 
                              resolutely)
                         You're very sweet. I had a wonderful 
                         time.
                              (she watches him, 
                              memorizing his face. 
                              Then firmly)
                         Goodbye.

               Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He 
               watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard 
               door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her.

               EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT

               Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the 
               dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes 
               back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She 
               is once again writing in her notebook.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss Carlson?

               Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS. 
               Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, 
               MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting 
               a weird glow.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good God...

                                     CARLSON
                         What are you...? You frightened me.

               Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch 
               it...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What sort of mechanism is this?

               Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Answer me!

                                     CARLSON
                         It's perfectly all right. It's...

               Leopold carefully examines the apparatus, stepping inside. 
               Carlson FREEZES.

                                     CARLSON
                              (carefully, 
                              deliberately)
                         Listen to me. Please. Move very 
                         slowly. Step out of the machine. 
                         Step out and I'll explain whatever 
                         you want to know.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is this? Who are you?

               His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.

                                     CARLSON
                         Oh, God.

               She YANKS on his arm. Instinctively he pulls away, 
               accidentally thrusting the lever into action. Carlson falls 
               from the machine.

                                     CARLSON
                              (suddenly frantic)
                         Get out of there! Get out now!

               The machine LIGHTS UP.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss Carlson... I...

                                     CARLSON
                         No!!!

               The compartment door snaps shut.

                                     CARLSON
                         Shit!!

               There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Blackness fills the screen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. N.Y.C. LABORATORY - 1995 DAY

               The compartment door slides OPEN revealing DR. KAU, 30's, an 
               Asian doctor with a THICK BROOKLYN ACCENT. Her face full of 
               enthusiasm drops as she sees the unconscious Leopold.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!!

               She turns to her co-workers, warning them.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!!

               She looks back at Leopold.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!!

               Her co-workers, DR. PLODDER, austere, authoritative, DR. 
               DRAKE, muddled and timid, peer inside the compartment door.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Good God!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Everybody stay calm... Lock the front 
                         door.

               Dr. Drake and Kau make a move to inspect an unconscious 
               Leopold.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         No, no, no. You mustn't touch him. 
                         The consequences could be 
                         catastrophic.

                                     DR. KAU
                         He could be hurt, or even dead.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         ...All right. Touch him.

               They approach Leopold. Dr. Kau finds Carlson's note pad on 
               the ground next to Leopold. She reads the last entry.

                                     DR. KAU
                         ...But I'm stuck and it's only a 
                         dance and he IS the seventh Duke of 
                         Albany...

               They all look at one another, then back at Leopold.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Carlson...!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                              (racing from the room)
                         Give me a minute...

                                     DR. KAU
                         Shit!

               INT. LAB - KATE'S OFFICE - DAY

               KATHERINE COLES, a radiant workaholic, types frenetically 
               into the computer while talking on the phone, trying hard 
               not to sound upset.

                                     KATE
                         Who's upset? People fall in love, 
                         they have to climb back out.
                              (she laughs but she 
                              is not smiling)
                         So, what? We'll just be friends now, 
                         Right?

               She stops typing and listens for a while. She runs her hand 
               through her hair.

                                     KATE
                         I see. Well I appreciate your honesty.
                              (using her middle 
                              finger she pushes up 
                              her glasses)
                         No. I'll just think of this as 
                         surviving another dating accident. 
                         Take care or good luck or whatever 
                         I'm supposed to...

               The line goes dead.

                                     KATE
                         ...say... Goodbye.

               Dr. Plodder bursts in. Kate sees his distress and instantly 
               becomes very centered.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         She's back.

                                     KATE
                              (rising)
                         That's impossible! She wasn't supposed 
                         to return until...

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Kate. It's Carlson. Something went 
                         wrong.

               He hands her Carlson's note pad. Slowly, she sits down.

                                     KATE
                         ...The 7th Duke...

               INT. LAB - DAY

                                     KATE
                              (all business, reading 
                              from a printout)
                         ...of Albany. He was the... IS the 
                         son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no 
                         actual importance until he vanished 
                         at the turn of the century without a 
                         trace. It was a sensation. In the 
                         30's they even made a movie about 
                         him. "The Tenuous Duke" with Ronald 
                         Coleman.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                              (absently)
                         I love Ronald Coleman.

                                     KATE
                         Despite much speculation and a nation 
                         wide investigation, a body was never 
                         found. He was never heard from again.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Until now.

               There is a stunned silence. They stare at Leopold in awe.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         We've altered the course of history.

                                     DR. KAU
                         We never should have started this...

                                     KATE
                         Calm down.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         What are we going to do? We can't 
                         keep him here. Imagine if anyone 
                         found out!

                                     KATE
                         Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now, 
                         no one would believe such a stupid 
                         mistake could be made because no one 
                         would believe any of this is possible. 
                         So. We fix this. We keep this to 
                         ourselves and we fix it. Fast.

               They all nod in agreement.

                                     KATE
                         Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st 
                         priority: Locate Carlson. Drake, 
                         determine the reciprocal correlation's 
                         connected to the 19th century. Work 
                         24 hours a day if necessary. In the 
                         meantime... one of us will have to 
                         take charge of him.

               She forces back panic. Only the tremor in her voice gives 
               her away.

                                     KATE
                         This is a major scientific 
                         opportunity. It doesn't get any better 
                         than this. Imagine. Researching the 
                         behavior, the physical and emotional 
                         characteristics of a century ago! 
                         Utilizing technology available to us 
                         today... He's a gold mine!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig.

                                     KATE
                         And while he's here, he's ours. Any 
                         volunteers?

               No one moves.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked 
                         will be responsible. Agreed?

               They nod reluctantly. Drake writes out names and throws them 
               in a cup. The silence becomes deafening. Finally:

                                     DR. KAU
                         I'll do it.

               All the scientists face her.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         You'll look after him?

                                     DR. KAU
                         No, I meant I'll pick the name.

               She reaches in. They wait with mounting suspense. Finally 
               SHE TURNS TO KATE. The scientists follow her gaze. A beat.

                                     KATE
                         Fine.

               Leopold stirs. He blinks at the group.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Where...? What has happened?!

               The doctors, caught off guard, SMILE BENIGNLY. They surround 
               Leopold as a group, not knowing where to begin. Finally:

                                     KATE
                         Your Grace... Um... Hello... Weee 
                         aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge 
                         research team. A project funded by 
                         the government of the United States.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (regarding their 
                              appearance with 
                              distaste)
                         Oh. Americans. I see...

                                     KATE
                         Yes, um... For the past six and a 
                         half years we've been conducting 
                         scientific experiments on density 
                         and flexibility in the dimensions of 
                         time and space.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came 
                         upon a formula utilizing Tachyons... 
                         particles traveling faster than the 
                         speed of light, which allowed us 
                         to... fold time so to speak.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Yes. Bend it between the cracks of 
                         the dimensions.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Yes.

               They all laugh nervously. Leopold does not.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Now, while that wasn't the original 
                         purpose of our experiment, we opted 
                         to pursue it, well, privately, on 
                         our own.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Borrowing funds already provided.

                                     KATE
                         We journeyed to your time because it 
                         was the quickest path to follow. We 
                         debated long and hard whether we 
                         should use this knowledge at all. 
                         Believe me, it was never our intent 
                         to disturb the past...

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Merely to discover if the expedition 
                         were possible. As your presence here 
                         confirms... we are very disturbed.

               Leopold nods at them as if they are insane.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         The problem facing us is not only 
                         HOW to get you back, but WHEN, you 
                         see?

                                     KATE
                         We certainly don't want to 
                         miscalculate. Send you to a different 
                         era entirely.

               Leopold starts to speak.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Rest assured, no harm will come to 
                         you. You'll be well looked after by 
                         Dr. Coles.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles...? I do not follow. What 
                         do you mean, get me back home?... 
                         Where am I?

               Awkward pause. Leopold looks carefully around the room for 
               the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting 
               and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting. 
               The doctors are silent.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Answer me!...
                              (slowly)
                         Would you have me believe... I am 
                         being detained, at present in the 
                         HEREAFTER?... The time to come?

                                     DR. PLODDER
                              (carefully)
                         It is the year nineteen hundred and 
                         ninety-five.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         ...19...?

               Leopold leaps up. The doctors follow him around the room.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're insane! All of you! This is 
                         impossible!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Leopold, calm down!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A voyage through time! What do you 
                         take me for? Did you bring me here 
                         by force?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         We're scientist, not seditionists.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (truly panicked)
                         Let me out of here! I won't stand 
                         for this another moment!

               He's out the door.

               INT. UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - DAY

               Leopold moves quickly, fearfully through the darkly lit 
               hallway, the doctors close behind.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, wait!

                                     DR. KAU
                         You don't know what you're doing.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Just listen to what we have to say!

               It is too late. Leopold throws open the door and runs 
               upstairs.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Blinding sunlight. Skyscrapers. Automobiles. Traffic lights. 
               Road construction. Modern day pedestrians. Helicopters. Car 
               alarms. Leopold stands frozen, overwhelmed, taking it all 
               in.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         19...?

               The doctors reach him. He collapses to the ground.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - DAY

               Kate and Dr. Kau talk quietly. Leopold, tightly holding onto 
               his seat and the back door, gazes out the window in utter 
               disbelief.

                                     KATE
                         Squab.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Squab?

                                     KATE
                         I remember reading they ate a lot of 
                         squab.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Squab... Do you have a squab?

                                     KATE
                              (quietly. On the verge 
                              of panic)
                         I don't know!

                                     DR. KAU
                         Pull yourself together!
                              (turning to Leopold)
                         Are you all right back there?

               Leopold, trembling, gapes at the sights, every day sounds, 
               magnified. Perspiration runs down the side of his face. Kate 
               watches him in her rear view mirror.

                                     KATE
                         You're going to be fine you know. 
                         There's nothing to worry about. I 
                         have everything under control.

               Dr. Kau stares at Kate in concerned silence.

                                     KATE
                              (quietly to Dr. Kau)
                         We'll never get away with this.

               INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

               Leopold awakens alone in his room. He sits up with a jolt. 
               His stomach sinks as he realizes THIS IS NO DREAM. He slowly 
               rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out 
               on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe. He makes 
               his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob.

               There is a KNOCK on the door.

               Leopold JUMPS back and runs to the bed: The picture of 
               dignity.

                                     KATE
                         How are you feeling?
                              (no response)
                         I thought you might like some tea.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I insist on being returned home 
                         immediately.

                                     KATE
                         I understand. We're doing our best.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I wish to speak with your employer, 
                         Dr. Coles.

                                     KATE
                         You're speaking to him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You are not suggesting that you are 
                         Dr. Coles?

               She smiles.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Miss... uh?

                                     KATE
                         Dr. Coles. If you like, you could 
                         call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's 
                         too much, how about just plain Kate?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (coldly)
                         A WOMAN of science?

                                     KATE
                         Hard to believe?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But a woman's brain cannot obtain 
                         enough knowledge to posses a truly 
                         scientific mind.

                                     KATE
                              (jotting this down)
                         Interesting. Nevertheless, we've 
                         come a long way baby.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (confused)
                         Are you attempting to be humorous?

                                     KATE
                         I'm attempting to be informative 
                         it's just coming out humorous.

               Leopold regards her dubiously.

                                     KATE
                              (clinically)
                         Look, modern social science clearly 
                         states that a woman's place in society 
                         marks the level of that civilization. 
                         A science career for a woman is now 
                         almost as acceptable as being a... 
                         a... waitress. Cream and sugar?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Young lady, I... Surely it is not 
                         expected that I remain here with you 
                         indefinitely... Unchaperoned?

                                     KATE
                              (pen poised)
                         Does that make you nervous?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Certainly not!

                                     KATE
                              (writing)
                         Then what are you getting so red 
                         about? It's a very large apartment... 
                         with locks on all the doors.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The idea! My dear Miss Coles...

                                     KATE
                         Dr. Coles.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Honey...

                                     KATE
                              (she puts the pad 
                              down)
                         Let's get one thing straight right 
                         now. My name is Kate or Katherine or 
                         if you insist Dr. Coles.
                              (she rises)
                         Take a good long look, Leopold. I am 
                         a 20th century American woman with a 
                         Doctorate and a commission and 
                         independence. I am not your "young 
                         lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your 
                         "honey." Is that clear?

               Leopold watches her with great interest. Finally:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Honey... For the tea.

                                     KATE
                         ...I'll get it for you.

               Kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room.

               INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

               Kate rummages through every drawer, shelf and cupboard 
               searching for the honey. Finally, she spots the honeybear 
               and squeezes honey A TAD TO VIOLENTLY into the tea. She tries 
               posing "confidently" then checks her reflection in the 
               toaster.

               INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

               Kate returns "confidently" with the tea and a plastic smile.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you... Has it been decided 
                         what it is I am to do while I am 
                         being held here?

                                     KATE
                         Oh, just some laundry, the cooking, 
                         a little light housework...

               Leopold doesn't react.

                                     KATE
                              (clearing her throat)
                         I took the liberty of preparing a 
                         simple schedule to efficiently utilize 
                         your time while incorporating you 
                         into my routine.
                              (she hands him a 
                              schedule)
                         As you can see, my day begins with 
                         meditation and yoga from 6:30 to 
                         7:00.

               She moves in close to him, making Leopold uncomfortable.

                                     KATE
                         YOU will arise at 6:45, shower and 
                         change and at 7:15, we breakfast 
                         together. 7:45 we begin the days 
                         work. At 10:45 Dr. Kau arrives to 
                         observe you in your natural routine 
                         as I research the data that will 
                         enable you to return home. At 1:15 
                         we lunch together. 2:15 you answer a 
                         daily questionnaire, I type up my 
                         notes. At precisely 6:15 you will 
                         enjoy 15 minutes of FREE TIME, then, 
                         at 6:30, I listen to Tom Brokaw while 
                         making dinner as YOU write down any 
                         questions that come up during your 
                         day. At 7:00, we dine together. If 
                         you need me at any time you may ring 
                         this bell.

               She rings a tiny dinner bell. He is about to speak.

                                     KATE
                         Now, Mondays and Wednesdays I have 
                         computer science class, Tuesdays I 
                         have therapy. IF I have a date, I'm 
                         usually home by 9:15. During these 
                         periods you may read any of the books 
                         I've picked out for you in your room. 
                         I organize my next days work at 10:30, 
                         11:35, David Letterman, 12:40 I'm in 
                         bed.
                              (she takes a breath, 
                              smiles at him)
                         Next day we begin again. Simple?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (after a beat, with 
                              great dignity)
                         ...At what time shall I WEE and POOH?

               Kate is forced into a stunned silence.

                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                         Kate? I'm home.

                                     KATE
                         Oh. Yes. Our chaperone is here.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Your father?

                                     KATE
                         Sort of. My brother.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Visiting?

                                     KATE
                         For the past two years. Charlie can 
                         never know about this project. We'll 
                         tell him you are a... overly 
                         distinguished colleague staying here 
                         as our guest. From Canada. Which 
                         would explain your lack of familiarity 
                         with our customs and so forth

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (aghast)
                         A CANADIAN?

                                     KATE
                         Make yourself comfortable. I'll check 
                         in on you later. I think this is 
                         going very well, don't you?

               Leopold looks at her blankly.

                                     KATE
                         Okay. If you need anything, just 
                         ring.

               Kate tinkles the bell, fumbles for the knob and heads out. 
               P.O.V. still on Leopold.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                              (shouting)
                         Charlie!

               Leopold reacts.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                              (screaming just as 
                              loud)
                         What?

                                     KATE
                              (still shouting)
                         Come here I wanna talk to you.

               Leopold listens at the door. He slowly opens it, takes two 
               steps out, peers around the corner, then quickly steps back 
               in. He takes a DEEP FRIGHTENED BREATH and slowly deflates.

               INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - MORNING

               Charlie sits on the couch smoking a cigarette surrounded by 
               his paintings. He is a likable twentysomething with a big 
               mouth.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What did I do?

                                     KATE
                              (removing his coffee 
                              from the table, 
                              setting it on a 
                              coaster)
                         RINGS! And what did I say about you 
                         smoking in the house?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You were against it.

                                     KATE
                         Correct. You're back early.
                              (She takes away his 
                              cigarette)

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey!... Are you all right? You look 
                         funny.

                                     KATE
                         Funny ha ha or funny odd?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Both.

                                     KATE
                         That all depends. How was your trip?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why?

                                     KATE
                         If it was good I'll tell you the 
                         truth. If it was rotten I'll have to 
                         butter you up first.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Butter me up.

                                     KATE
                         Have you been working out? No, I'm 
                         really starting to see results. Are 
                         you comfortable there on the couch?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Very.

                                     KATE
                         Good. Cause you'll be sleeping there 
                         the next few nights.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate!

                                     KATE
                         You have to be out of here by 8 and 
                         you can't be back before 6. We have 
                         an important man working with us 
                         with very unusual needs. The company 
                         is insisting he stay here.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What about a hotel?

                                     KATE
                         This man requires around the clock 
                         attention.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I meant for me.

                                     KATE
                         Thank you, Charlie.
                              (she kisses his 
                              forehead)
                         I owe you one.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You owe me nine. What am I supposed 
                         to do all day?

                                     KATE
                              (as if having an 
                              epiphany)
                         You could get a job!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, the entire point of being an 
                         artist is that I don't have to work. 
                         Who is this guy?

                                     KATE
                         Well, I can't tell you much because...

                                     KATE AND CHARLIE
                         I'm not allowed to discuss what goes 
                         on at the office.

                                     KATE
                         Well I'm not. Anyway, it might be 
                         interesting to have someone else to 
                         talk to. It gets so quiet around 
                         here sometimes I feel like I've gone 
                         deaf.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Does he have a label?

                                     KATE
                         Leopold.

                                     CHARLIE
                         LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his 
                         name?

                                     KATE
                         He's exactly like his name.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Then you owe me ten.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Leopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room. 
               Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up 
               to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright 
               fashionable furniture. Leopold recoils. His eyes come to 
               rest on the television set. The ON OFF buttons loom large. 
               He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button 
               ON.

               Instantly, REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other before 
               an excited crowd.

               Leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of 
               him as if shooing away a bee. He quickly, yet cautiously, 
               slams the power OFF.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Horrible!

               He quickly scurries out the hallway.

               He stops abruptly. He remains very still. Composing himself, 
               he turns and deliberately faces the room. After a moment, he 
               purposefully steps back inside.

               He makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted 
               by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that. 
               He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly 
               examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room.

               He looks at the lights then back at the switch. He flicks 
               the lights ON and OFF, trying to figure out the precise moment 
               in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself.

               Kate and Charlie enter. They watch Leopold flicking the 
               lights, laughing like a madman. Charlie gives Kate a look.

                                     KATE
                              (explaining)
                         He's from Canada...

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold sits at the head of the table, Kate and Charlie 
               banished to either side. Leopold chews his dinner incessantly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (finally)
                         What is this?

                                     KATE
                         It's called Hamburger Helper.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is beyond help. Please serve the 
                         next course.

               He pushes his plate away.

                                     KATE
                         I'm afraid there is no next course. 
                         If you make a list of the foods you 
                         like, I'll pick them up at the store 
                         for you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is all food here this... textured?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Mine's good.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Please understand, I am used to a 
                         different sort of preparation. Where 
                         I come from a proper meal is the 
                         result of reflection and study. A 
                         recipe is merely a theme which an 
                         intelligent cook can plan each time 
                         with variation.

               Charlie gives Kate a look.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Several courses are served. Menus 
                         are often prepared days in advance, 
                         timed to perfection. It is said, 
                         without the culinary art, the 
                         crudeness of reality would make life 
                         unbearable.

                                     CHARLIE
                         In Canada?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (after a beat. Firmly)
                         In Canada.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We have a saying here. "Shake and 
                         shake the catsup bottle, none will 
                         come and then a lot'll."

               He pours catsup on his dinner.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How interesting.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Since you're such an expert on fine 
                         cuisine, why don't you make dinner 
                         tomorrow night?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It should be obvious to you that I 
                         am NOT a domestic. You may take my 
                         plate.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I have my own, thank you.

                                     KATE
                         Charlie...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who died and made me Cinderella?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Young man, there is a distinct 
                         impertinence to your voice.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's part of my charm.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Suppress it.

                                     KATE
                              (changing the subject)
                         Leopold... Since you're our guest 
                         here, there are several cultural 
                         events you might enjoy seeing. Charlie 
                         has season tickets to the ball game. 
                         Perhaps you'd like to take that in?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What is it??

                                     KATE
                         Or the Opera or the Ballet?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What is it??

                                     KATE
                         Charlie, there's no rule that says 
                         everyone has to be interested in 
                         baseball.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, but I believe there is a rule 
                         that says everyone has to have HEARD 
                         of it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles, your brother Charles 
                         attitude and demeanor are 
                         unacceptable. If I am to stay on 
                         here you must have a serious talk 
                         with him regarding respect and 
                         civility.

                                     KATE
                         CHARLES, could you help me with the 
                         dessert in the kitchen?

                                     CHARLIE
                         In the kitchen?

                                     KATE
                         IN the kitchen. Excuse us.

               Kate and Charlie leave. The camera remains on Leopold, sitting 
               alone, calmly sipping his wine. VOICE OVER FROM THE KITCHEN:

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't believe this guy!

                                     KATE
                         Try to be nice to him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm always NICE!

                                     KATE
                         Please Charlie, as a favor to me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He gives me the creeps.

               Leopold reacts. He listens self-consciously.

                                     KATE
                         He's different that's all.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What was that crack about domestics?

                                     KATE
                         Charlie, this is important to me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're not going out with him, are 
                         you?

                                     KATE
                         Eeuuu! I may be desperate but I'm 
                         not a lost cause.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, this is me. I've seen the guys 
                         you bring home.

                                     KATE
                         I've done countless favors for you! 
                         Now I'm asking for just one little 
                         thing...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (overlapping)
                         Oh, all right! All right! All right!

               They emerge from the kitchen, beaming.

                                     KATE
                              (after a beat)
                         We forgot the dessert.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know,... I don't know if I 
                         mentioned it... but that is one fine 
                         looking suit.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - 6:30 A. M.

               Radio alarm clock -- 7:45 a.m. Louis Armstrong begins to 
               sing, "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off." Dressed in yoga 
               clothes Kate sits on her bed in the lotus position. She bangs 
               the gong and closes her eyes. A bell rings. Kate flinches 
               but does not open her eyes.

                                     KATE
                              (too sweetly)
                         What is it, Leopold?

               The bell rings louder, interrupting Kate's routine.

                                     KATE
                              (eyes closed, screaming 
                              like a fishwife)
                         WHAT IS IT, LEOPOLD?!

               Leopold's bell rings with determination. Kate is off the bed 
               and out of the room.

               INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

               Kate enters and stops short. Leopold sits at the table ringing 
               a BELL. The dishwasher is open and SPRAYING WILDLY, the 
               blender has spread breakfast shake EVERYWHERE, water is 
               BOILING OVER on the stove, refrigerator, freezer, and every 
               cupboard door is OPEN. Garbage disposal runs FULL BLAST.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (calmly amidst the 
                              chaos)
                         I cannot seem to find the tea...

               CLOSE UP: Leopold's hand rings a bell with irritation.

               INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - EVENING

               Leopold, Kate, and Charlie stand in front of Charlie's open 
               closet. Leopold selects clothes from Charlie's wardrobe.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No... No... No. Good God, no!... 
                         Perhaps...

               He tosses them aside carelessly as Charlie seethes.

               CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell.

               INT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING

               Kate and Charlie form a line to the bathroom. Kate checks 
               her schedule and bangs on the door.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, your time is up! What's he 
                         got, a girl in there?

               INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING

               Leopold Luxuriates in the bathtub wearing a "Whitecap" 
               marveling at the whirlpool and the instant hot water. He 
               picks up a can of shaving cream and inspects it in wonder. 
               It SPRAYS.

               CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell. Nothing happens. He 
               discovers the clapper has been stolen.

               INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON

               Kate types, talks and researches simultaneously. She looks 
               up and stops suddenly.

               Leopold appears wearing MANY oddly assorted layers of 
               Charlie's clothes, a bandanna bow tie, Irish woolen cap, 
               bicycle gloves, aluminum baseball bat walking stick. He poses 
               foppishly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I should like to read about modern 
                         currency during my bath tonight. See 
                         that the tub and basin are scrubbed 
                         up. Remnants remain of this afternoons 
                         shave.

               Kate nods at him stupefied. Due to the many layers of 
               clothing, he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing 
               skis.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold rings a BIG NEW COWBELL. No one responds.

               INT. CHARLIE'S WORKROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

               He discovers Kate at her computer, Charlie reading a book. 
               Each are wearing a walkman.

               He stands in front of them and rings his cowbell furiously 
               until they look up.

               INT. STUDY - DAY

               Leopold studies his questionnaire, Kate researches Victorian 
               customs. They simultaneously look up and gaze at the other. 
               A beat.

               Embarrassed, Kate dons her glasses and Leopold shuffles 
               papers. They look up again. Then down. Then get back to work.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Kate sits on her bed with her laptop watching David Letterman. 
               She glances up, laughs out loud. She looks at the dark empty 
               room. No one is there to share it with. Closing her computer, 
               she holds her pillow close to her. She slowly moves to the 
               window and looks out.

               INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A text book with Leopold's picture inside. Leopold reads the 
               brief summary of his life with heartbreaking astonishment. 
               He moves to the window and looks out.

               EXT. N.Y.C. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Kate and Leopold gaze out of their windows. The camera slowly 
               pulls back until they are swallowed up by the city.

               INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON

               Kate scans her notes as Leopold paces dully about the room.

                                     KATE
                         In our last session you intimated 
                         there was a symmetrical system 
                         regulating the social order of 
                         conformity spanning your era. I found 
                         this particularly intriguing If I 
                         can just find it in my notes...

               A fire engine races by. Leopold dashes to the window then 
               turns back, excited.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The fire brigade!

               Kate stares at him blankly. She munches RICE CAKES and drinks 
               water FROM THE BOTTLE. A beat. She returns to her notes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is insufferable! I refuse to be 
                         spied upon, skipped over, or shuffled 
                         about any longer. I have yet to 
                         venture outside this cell. Before I 
                         go mad a more suitable arrangement 
                         must be found.

                                     KATE
                         Found it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (startled)
                         A resolution?

                                     KATE
                         No I meant I found my notes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles! Changes are in order.

                                     KATE
                         I can hear you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (under control now)
                         Miss Coles, as we are to remain here 
                         together, there are certain conditions 
                         I insist are met and maintained. I 
                         no longer wish to be peeped at, 
                         mocked...

                                     KATE
                         I never...

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (calmly)
                         Or interrupted. Jot this down. 
                         Breakfast at 12. Luncheon at 4. Diner 
                         at 8. A horse should be made available 
                         from 1 to 3.

                                     KATE
                         A horse? In New York City?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes. Also, I feel very strongly about 
                         your style of dress. I do not care 
                         for it.
                              (Kate looks up)
                         I cannot believe it is the prevailing 
                         taste for women to appear masculine 
                         and unkempt. If this is the fashion, 
                         have it altered.

               Kate rises.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         That is all for the present.

               He grandly hands her a napkin.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         CRUMBS, my dear!

                                     KATE
                              (infuriated)
                         Thank you!

               Brushing herself off, she heads to the door.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles. I have been acquainted 
                         with many women in my time, yet I am 
                         compelled to say that the modern 
                         woman is by far the least attractive 
                         I have ever encountered.

                                     KATE
                              (rising to the occasion)
                         And I have a news flash of my own.

               Leopold waits.

                                     KATE
                         You sir, are no Ronald Coleman!

               She storms out.

               INT. LAB - EARLY MORNING

               Dr. Drake enters Dr. Kau's office with two pints of Haagen 
               Dazs.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough 
                         Swirl or Peach?

                                     DR. KAU
                         Peach.

               They dig in.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Any luck?

                                     DR. KAU
                         Yea. Lots of luck. All bad. No 
                         information exists detailing what 
                         happened to Carlson. I've been working 
                         for weeks and I'm not any closer 
                         than when I began... How are you 
                         doing?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         My cholesterol level is up 70 points.

               Kate enters, exhausted, deposits an armful of papers on Dr. 
               Drake's desk. Kate has pencils tucked behind her ear, through 
               her hair, and in her mouth.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Thank you, Kate... How're you managing 
                         with Leopold?

                                     KATE
                         Fine. Fine... Why? What did you hear?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Nothing. I was just asking.

                                     KATE
                         Oh. Well, it's fine. He's a delight. 
                         Everything's under control.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Keep up the good work.
                              (after she's gone)
                         She seemed a little scattered. Do 
                         you think everything's all right?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Katherine Coles is the most capable 
                         person we have on this project. If 
                         anyone can handle the delicacy of 
                         this situation, Kate can.

                                     DR. KAU
                         So there's nothing to worry about?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Absolutely not.

               INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - EARLY EVENING

                                     KATE
                         GONE? GONE WHERE?!
                              (Charlie shrugs)
                         Charlie we've got to find him!

                                     CHARLIE
                              (working on a VERY 
                              STERN portrait of 
                              Kate at her computer)
                         Are you crazy? This is the first 
                         time all week my eyes aren't darting 
                         to the top of my sockets every five 
                         minutes.

                                     KATE
                         When did he leave?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't know. An hour ago? He said 
                         he wanted to take a walk.

                                     KATE
                         And you let him?? He's not allowed 
                         to go outside!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is he being punished?

                                     KATE
                         We've got to find him! You stay here 
                         in case he finds his way back. And 
                         while you wait you'd better pray 
                         he's all right. If anything happens 
                         to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING 
                         we've worked for will have been 
                         destroyed.

               She heads out the door. Charlie follows.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, calm down.

                                     KATE
                         And YOU'LL be responsible. Understand?
                              (she grabs her coat 
                              and purse)

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's the big deal? Who is this 
                         guy?

               Kate takes a LONG pause.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold... is not really from Canada.

               EXT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON

               Peaceful. The sun sets. Pigeons rest on window sills. 
               Suddenly:

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         OH MY GOD!!!

               The pigeons take flight.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - EVENING

               Leopold leaves Central Park profoundly lost. Looking both 
               ways in the wrong direction, he crosses the street. SCREECHING 
               brakes, HONKING horns, FURIOUS shouts with Leopold, horrified, 
               caught in the middle. He makes it across shaking and dazed. 
               A motorist pulls along side of him.

                                     WOMAN MOTORIST
                         You stupid fucking son of a bitch. 
                         Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron.

               Leopold GAPES, appalled. A Hansom carriage slowly treads 
               into Central Park. Leopold watches until it disappears.

               INT. KATE'S GREEN A.M.C. PACER - NIGHT

               Kate drives slowly, searching for Leopold. Cars honk with 
               mounting anger.

                                     CABBY
                         What're ya waiting for lady? An 
                         invitation?

                                     KATE
                         I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

               She continues searching, trying hard to remain calm.

               EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

               Huge buildings. Neon lights flashing. Garbage in bundles. 
               Calvin Klein Ads. In the center of it all, Leopold, jostled 
               BADLY by the crowd, tipping his hat to all the ladies. He 
               enters a deli.

               INT. DELI - NIGHT

               Leopold, appalled by the prices searches for money. He has 
               none.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to the counter man)
                         $7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct?

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         You gotta problem with that?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It seems rather pricey to me.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         So don't buy one.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I shan't.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         So shan't!

               He moves on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes, I... I would be happy to sample 
                         one however I'm afraid I haven't the 
                         finance with me just now. If I could 
                         establish a credit with you, I will 
                         have someone come round with the 
                         funds tomorrow.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a 
                         hamburger today, is that it?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (a little confused)
                         I believe so. Yes.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Get the fuck outta here.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Get out. Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         May I remind you, merchant, that I 
                         am the customer in this establishment 
                         and as such require your attention 
                         and the utmost respect. I do not 
                         accept this modern convention of 
                         desecrating one's patrons with such 
                         contemptuous disregard.

                                     YUPPIE WOMAN
                         You tell him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Need I add that without our patronage 
                         you would not own that unwashed 
                         counter behind which you spew your 
                         filthy mouth?

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Where do you get off? You don't even 
                         have any money.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Don't be irrelevant... I'm browsing.

                                     COUNTER MAN
                         Not in my store you're not.

               He comes out from behind the counter. He's big.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (very superior)
                         Do you intend to physically escort 
                         me out...?

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Leopold is thrown out of the store and on to the street.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Did you see what he did? Did you see 
                         that?

               No one responds. Leopold is left sprawled on the street. 
               Thunder is heard.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - NIGHT

               Gargoyles at New York City Library, The Dakota, the Bowery, 
               Alphabet City.

               EXT. CLAIRMOUNT STABLES - 4 A.M.

               Pouring rain. Leopold stands in front of the stables beaten 
               and drenched. A car drives by, screeches to a stop, and 
               hastily backs up along side Leopold.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold! Leopold, get in.

               Leopold stares at the car. Kate runs out, opens the door and 
               helps him in. She dashes back into the drivers seat.

               INT. CAR - 4 A.M.

                                     KATE
                              (nearly in tears, 
                              trying to dry him 
                              off)
                         Leopold! Oh, Leopold thank God you're 
                         all right. I didn't think I'd ever 
                         find you. You had us all so worried. 
                         Oh, Leopold!

               She hits him hard.

                                     KATE
                         Don't you ever go out again without 
                         my permission, do you hear me? I was 
                         frantic. You could have been killed 
                         a hundred times over. I never would 
                         have known.

               She rests her head on the steering wheel, exhausted. She 
               pulls herself together and looks at him.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, are you all right?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (looking deep into 
                              her eyes for the 
                              first time)
                         I wish to go home.

                                     KATE
                         Okay. I'll get you home in a jiffy.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (badly shaken)
                         No... I wish to go home.

               Kate gently observes Leopold who stares rigidly straight 
               ahead.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                                     CHARLIE
                              (on the phone)
                         I don't know. It's just Leopold. 
                         Like Cher. Or Goofy.

               Kate and Leopold walk in wet and exhausted.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Never mind they just walked in. Jesus. 
                         You look horrible.

                                     KATE
                         Charlie, don't start. I haven't been 
                         this angry at you since you got me 
                         into that pyramid thing last year. 
                         If you make a wisecrack I'm going to 
                         burst into flame.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It wasn't a wisecrack. You do look 
                         horrible.

                                     KATE
                         I'm too tired for this now. I'll 
                         just save it up and kill you tomorrow. 
                         Help Leopold out of his things and 
                         lets get him to bed.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I've something to say. To the both 
                         of you. I... Nothing is what it seems. 
                         After witnessing mere weeks of this 
                         age it is painfully apparent I am 
                         outside of my acquaintance... I don't 
                         know how to proceed. I frankly... am 
                         in need of assistance. I'm sorry. 
                         I'm not very good at this. In the 
                         event you have missed it, I am 
                         apologizing.

               There is a long pause.

                                     CHARLIE
                         About time.
                              (he shakes Leopold's 
                              hand reluctantly)
                         Welcome back.
                              (he leaves)

                                     KATE
                         Don't mind him. His heart would be 
                         in the right place if he had a heart. 
                         Surliness runs in my family.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand. It practically races 
                         through mine.

                                     KATE
                              (shocked)
                         Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one 
                         that's not at my expense. That's 
                         good.

               They look at each other just a second too long.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         We'd better get to bed... That is...

                                     KATE
                         Yes... I start work...
                              (she looks at her 
                              watch)
                         in three and a half hours.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh, dear.

               They self-consciously head to their respective rooms.

                                     KATE
                         It's fine. I'm used to it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You mustn't get too used to it. You'll 
                         find life passes you by awfully 
                         quickly.

               Kate is struck by his vulnerability for the first time and 
               is moved. She catches herself quickly however.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you for...

                                     KATE
                              (waving it away)
                         Oh!

               They stand at their bedroom doors.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Well, goodnight then.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?... I don't have a clear 
                         handle on this. Perhaps I was wrong 
                         keeping you confined to the apartment 
                         all this time. I don't know when 
                         you'll be able return home... Tomorrow 
                         I'll start preparing you for the 
                         outside world. And... We'll find 
                         your way back. I promise.

               Leopold smiles, still shaken. A beat. They slowly close the 
               doors to their respective rooms.

               INT. HALLWAY - BRIGHT SUNNY MORNING

               Leopold, dressed for an outing knocks on Kate's bedroom door.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         Yes?

               Leopold enters. Kate stands in a slip calmly looking at 
               Leopold. Leopold immediately turns, facing the door.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was 
                         merely... I didn't...

                                     KATE
                         Is there something you want, Leopold?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I merely wanted to see... that is, 
                         inquire, on your availability, for 
                         an outing... My assimilation and so 
                         forth.

                                     KATE
                         Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of 
                         us. I'll be out in a minute.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes, of course. Splendid.

               He reaches around behind his back and fumbles for the knob. 
               He finally finds it and goes out.

               Kate smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller 
               Center, 5th Avenue.

               EXT. 5TH AVENUE - DAY

               Kate and Leopold exit The Gap. Leopold awkwardly wears hip 
               Gap casual clothes, a baseball cap on his head.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Are you certain this is correct?

               Kate places the cap backwards on his head. She nods 
               approvingly.

                                     KATE
                         Certainly I'm certain.

               Leopold watches himself in store windows. He CAN'T comprehend 
               it. Kate leads him into Barney's.

               INT. BARNEY'S - DAY

               Leopold stands before the mirror wearing a classic dark suit. 
               He looks FANTASTIC. A fact that is not lost on Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Now really. Isn't this better?

               Kate nods back begrudgingly, her breath taken away.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, Gristedes.

               INT. GRISTEDES MARKET - DAY

               Kate selects a shopping cart, begins to push it.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Allow me.

               Kate walks ahead. Leopold, maneuvering a cart with a broken 
               wheel, hasn't the knack and bangs into everyone and everything 
               in the aisle.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Sorry. Oops! Careful there. So sorry.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE UPS: Leopold scrutinizing vegetables in cans, cereals 
               for kids, bottled water, instant soup, feminine hygiene 
               supplies.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The check out line. As their groceries are being rung up, 
               Leopold spots The Sun, a newspaper with the headline: Woman 
               Sees Satan in her Microwave Oven. Leopold eagerly shows Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Have you seen today's paper?

                                     KATE
                         Put it back.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But...

                                     KATE
                         Back!

               Leopold reads the paper totally enthralled.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Kate and Leopold walk down the street, a bag in each arm. 
               Leopold eyes Kate suspiciously.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles, why is it you are not 
                         married?

                                     KATE
                         Women are longer defined by the men 
                         they're married to, Leopold. I have 
                         a career. I haven't found a man who 
                         fits in with that yet.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yet people still marry?

                                     KATE
                              (defensively)
                         I've heard of cases.

               They continue to walk, Leopold noticeably studies Kate. 
               Finally:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I suspect there is something wrong 
                         with you.

                                     KATE
                         There's nothing wrong with me!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps it is the way you present 
                         yourself.

                                     KATE
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         There is some sort of problem when a 
                         woman reaches thirty and insists on 
                         remaining single.

                                     KATE
                         You think I'm THIRTY?!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What?

                                     KATE
                         Do I look THIRTY to you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It was an arbitrary number.

                                     KATE
                         You chose it specifically opposed to 
                         a lower number.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I didn't mean it.

                                     KATE
                         ...Thirty!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I apologize... How old are you?

                                     KATE
                              (sharply)
                         I'm thirty! But you're the first 
                         person whoever told me I looked it!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm sorry.

               Leopold spots a formal dress in a store window. He takes a 
               good long look at Kate, smiles, then quickly walks inside. 
               Kate continues down the block.

                                     KATE
                         And it's not that I insist on 
                         remaining single. Believe me. Everyone 
                         dreams of finding somebody to share 
                         their life with. To give someone all 
                         the love they've been hoarding since 
                         they were a kid. I'm no different. 
                         But one has to be sensible. I have a 
                         career and a life that's filled 
                         with...

               She looks around. Leopold is gone.

                                     KATE
                         Not again...

               She starts off down the street, stops, and enters ROBERTA'S, 
               an upscale boutique.

               INT. ROBERTA'S - DAY

               Kate races in. Leopold talks with a saleslady.

                                     KATE
                         What do I have to do? Put a leash 
                         around your neck?

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to the saleslady)
                         She is the woman to whom I was 
                         referring. You see the problem?

                                     SALESLADY
                              (giving Kate the once 
                              over)
                         Yep.

                                     KATE
                              (staring down at her 
                              clothes then back at 
                              the two of them)
                         What?... What?

               INT. ROBERTA'S - DAY

               From behind the dressing room door, Kate shouts to the others 
               with irritation.

                                     KATE
                         This is ridiculous. I don't have 
                         time to...
                              (she shrieks)
                         Do you know what this dress costs? 
                         Let's get this over with. I'm coming 
                         out. Nobody laugh.

               Kate leaves the dressing room in a huff COMPLETELY UNAWARE 
               that she is STUNNING.

                                     KATE
                         Satisfied?

               Leopold and the saleslady stare at her with pleasure.

                                     KATE
                         ...What?

               She turns and looks at herself in the mirror. Leopold stands 
               behind her, pulls back her hair, brushes away her bangs.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You have a lovely face.

               Even Kate cannot deny that she is lovely. She stares at 
               herself for a long while.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (quietly)
                         We'll take the dress.

               They become aware of their close proximity. They nervously 
               part.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Kate sits Leopold down on the sofa. She turns on the TV and 
               hands him the remote control.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is this?

                                     KATE
                         The drug of the 20th century.

               She aims the remote at the TV, changing channels. He's 
               spellbound.

               INT. DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Dinner is served. Kate waits patiently for Leopold who sits 
               on the sofa watching the TV.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, your dinner's getting cold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm coming.

               He does not move a muscle.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kate and Leopold sit on the sofa eating their dinner and 
               watching TV. On the screen, a Looney Tune. Leopold enjoys 
               this especially. Kate reaches for the remote but Leopold 
               grabs it territorially, refusing to relinquish it.

                                     KATE
                              (making notes)
                         It's a guy thing.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control. 
               Kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over Leopold. 
               She glances around the room, then slowly bends down close to 
               capture a better look at his face.

               After a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand 
               and sits down at her computer. She opens her notes and types. 
               Her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop. She 
               looks up at Leopold lost in thought. She smiles.

               Reaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to 
               the floor. In a SMASHED frame, Kate and CARLSON drunkenly 
               mug for the camera. Kate pales noticeably.

               She looks from the picture to Leopold. Slowly, she begins 
               pecking away at the keys. She does not look up again.

               INT. LAB - LATE AFTERNOON

               Kate gives Leopold a tour of the lab stopping by Dr. Drakes 
               area. Hidden behind chalk boards, calculator paper, and 
               several empty Haagen Dazs containers, Dr. Drake searches for 
               solutions.

                                     KATE
                         ...Now within that astronomical 
                         structure, Dr. Drake here is searching 
                         for a pathway between your time and 
                         the present. He'll find it too if 
                         his arteries don't harden first.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Astounding.

                                     KATE
                         Once that is discovered, the search 
                         begins for the exact time and date 
                         travel will be possible.

               They move to Dr. Kau's area.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to Dr. Kau)
                         How are you proceeding?

               Dr. Kau merely grunts. Leopold looks at Kate.

                                     KATE
                         Don't take it personally. Once Dr. 
                         Kau starts working, you just have to 
                         wait until her batteries run down. 
                         We're all pretty much like that.

               They head into Kate's office.

               INT. KATE'S OFFICE - DAY

               Kate gathers her belongings, Leopold snoops at her notes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The complexity of this equation is 
                         astonishing? Can you really comprehend 
                         all that?

                                     KATE
                              (simply. Almost 
                              apologetically)
                         I'm a genius.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're quite exceptional Dr. Coles.
                              (a beat)
                         That is to say, you all are.

                                     KATE
                         Thank you. And may I say that 
                         sometimes, in DIM light, you're not 
                         so bad yourself.

               They stand together, Leopold grinning sheepishly.

                                     KATE
                         Oh my God! Is that the time? I'm 
                         late. Therapy. Every Tuesday night.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         May I accompany you?

                                     KATE
                         You mayn't.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I am not certain I understand therapy.

                                     KATE
                         No one does. That's why therapists 
                         can charge so much.

               As she gathers her belongings, Leopold spots a very high 
               heeled red shoe in Kate's bag.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What exactly transpires during 
                         therapy?

                                     KATE
                         Leopold. A gentleman does not ask 
                         those questions. Come on, we'll get 
                         you home.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I am perfectly able to travel homeward 
                         myself.

               Kate looks at him skeptically.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Really! I have finance and our 
                         address. I shall take a cabbie.

               Kate hesitates.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You are late. I insist. I am NOT a 
                         child. Dr. Coles.

                                     KATE
                         All right. Don't bite my head off.

               She shakes her head and walks out the door.

               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

               Kate heads down the stairs of a subway station. A few feet 
               behind, Leopold cautiously follows.

               INT. SUBWAY STATION - RUSH HOUR

               Kate waits in line at the turnstile. Leopold, a ways back, 
               grimaces noticeably at the smell.

               Kate heads through. Leopold follows banging painfully into 
               the bar. A NUN hurriedly bumps into him from behind.

               He tries pushing the bar but it doesn't budge. He turns around 
               to step out of line but it is already too long. He stands 
               NOSE to NOSE with the nun.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I can't seem to...

                                     NUN
                              (impatiently)
                         Oh, for heaven's sake...

               The nun deposits her token and SQUEEZES them both through as 
               the train arrives at a deafening pitch, startling Leopold.

               He spots Kate entering the train and jumps into the car in 
               the nick of time. The train departs, Leopold pressed awkwardly 
               against the glass.

               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - EARLY EVENING

               Kate races from the subway station, entering the Arthur Murray 
               Dance Studio. Leopold, thoroughly disheveled, follows at a 
               distance.

               INT. DANCE STUDIO - EVENING

               Elderly Blue haired couples chat amongst themselves, men on 
               the right, women on the left. Kate, in dance clothes, out of 
               breath, stumbles in, making a b-line for the women's side.

                                     MRS. PINCUS
                         I was worried. I thought you weren't 
                         going to make it.

                                     KATE
                              (smiling happily)
                         Miss my lesson? This is the only 
                         thing I have to look forward to all 
                         week. Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus?

               Mrs. Pincus executes a fancy spin, proudly showing off her 
               purchase. Across the room, MR. Pincus beams in anticipation.

               An elderly, overly made up dance instructor enters. She claps 
               her hands together loudly.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         All right, kids. Pair up!

               The men slick back their hair. The women straighten their 
               gowns. Kate stands to the side, self-consciously studying 
               the floor.

               The men take their places on the dance floor. They flick 
               their hand twice, inviting their women to dance. Cooly, 
               elegantly, the women approach their partners. After a while 
               Kate looks up, relieved. She stands alone. Ballroom music 
               plays.

               The couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns. Kate 
               dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a 
               beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated YEARNING 
               look spread across her face.

               The instructor approaches with a look of resignation.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Don't think so much, Katie. FEEL the 
                         music.

                                     KATE
                              (sweating)
                         I am!

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Dancing should not be work. It should 
                         be a vacation the body takes from 
                         the mind. Let the music wash over 
                         you.

                                     KATE
                              (frustrated)
                         It is!

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Repeat after me: I've got the muusic 
                         in me.

                                     KATE
                         I've got the muusic in me.

                                     INSTRUCTOR & KATE
                              (overlapping)
                         I've got the muusic in me!

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Keep telling yourself that.

               Kate does. Her instructor shakes her head and moves away.

               Across the room, through the window, Leopold watches, moved.

               LEOPOLD'S P.O.V. -- Over the music, beyond the swirling 
               couples, Kate remains in the corner, dancing with her 
               imaginary partner, fighting valiantly for the right steps, 
               muttering to herself, dancing alone.

               INT. LAB - MORNING

               Dr. Kau SLAMS a large book on Dr. Plodder's desk startling 
               him.

                                     DR. KAU
                         I've located her.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         You didn't! Is she all right?

                                     DR. KAU
                         No. She's really not.

               Photograph of a SWEATSHOP 1896. The conditions are APPALLING. 
               Positioned among the workers, Julia Carlson, thin, ragged, 
               worn out, stares helplessly into the camera.

                                     DR. KAU
                         It was taken a year after she arrived. 
                         Look at her face! We have to get her 
                         back.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Christine, this morning I spoke with 
                         the head of funding. They're talking 
                         about canceling the project.

                                     DR. KAU
                         What?! They can't do that!

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         There's still time. Nothing has 
                         happened yet that can't be undone. 
                         We'll get her back. We'll put this 
                         behind us and we'll get her back.

               The doctors stare at the photograph. Powerless.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - DAY

               Charlie and Leopold work at their easels. Leopold sighs 
               HEAVILY.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is there something on your mind?

               There is a pause.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is rather difficult for me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         ...Uh huh...?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I have been in the salon contemplating 
                         the reception I have received by the 
                         various tradesmen I have visited. 
                         I've determined I am lacking the 
                         dexterity of modern intercourse.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Of what??

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Social skills.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I realize our association has been 
                         rather distant and I bear you no ill 
                         will.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can imagine my relief.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The fact is... I need help.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why not ask Kate?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I would appreciate the masculine 
                         point of view.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why not ask Kate?... That was a joke.

               Leopold looks worried. Charlie puts down his brush.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well? Let's see... I guess we could 
                         start by removing that great big 
                         stick from up your... Let's start 
                         with your walk.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         My walk?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You don't walk right.
                              (gently)
                         You strut.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (very defensive)
                         STRUT?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Strut strut strut. You walk into the 
                         bathroom it's like I'm watching a 
                         parade. Walk across the room.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will not.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know you won't. You'll STRUT. You 
                         asked for my help. Trust me on this.

               As Leopold struts across the room Charlie shakes his head 
               and spontaneously begins to hum Sousa's Stars and Stripes 
               March. Leopold becomes more and more agitated. As the song 
               crescendos:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         That's enough! Really! You walk.

               Charlie hops up, casually walks around the room and begins 
               to hum a more relaxed version of Stars and Stripes.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (between choruses)
                         See? Easy. Relaxed. You try.

               Leopold begins humming the more casual version of the song 
               and mimics Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's better. Now, try to enjoy 
                         your walk. It's a beautiful day. The 
                         sun is shining, the peasants are 
                         singing.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               VOICE OVER: Charlie and Leopold joyously singing The Stars 
               and Stripes. As the song builds:

               Charlie enters leading Leopold throughout the room. Leopold 
               matches Charlie EXACTLY step by step so tightly they appear 
               to be one person marching happily about.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Chinatown, Little Italy, chess in Washington Square Park.

               EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY

               Leopold and Charlie explore the city. Leopold works diligently 
               on his walk. A beautiful woman walks by in a revealing outfit. 
               Charlie catches Leopold watching her and smiles broadly.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Interesting?

               Leopold, caught leering, turns away sheepishly and smiles. 
               Charlie pats Leopold on the back. Stops. Pats his back again.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What the hell is that?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Leopold, are you wearing a corset?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Naturally.

               Cracking up, Charlie good-naturedly puts an arm around 
               Leopold's shoulder. Leopold attempts the same pulls away.

               INT. BLOCKBUSTER RECORDS - NIGHT

               With a headset on, Charlie listens to music. Leopold watches.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What'd ya say was the name of this 
                         number?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Tchaikovsky. Waltz of the Flowers.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (deadpan)
                         Pretty.

               Charlie stops the music and places a headset over Leopold's 
               ears. Leopold watches calmly. Charlie selects a song. 
               Instantly, Leopold's shoulders rise up to his ears. His mouth 
               opens wide.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Megadeath. High Speed Dirt.

               After a bit, Charlie turns the music off. Leopold's shoulders 
               go down but his mouth stays wide open. Astonished.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Charlie and Leopold walk through the park. A rubber softball 
               hits Leopold squarely on the head.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What in the world...?

               A couple race over. The man is BLACK. The woman is WHITE. 
               Their child, ELIZABETH, 7, follows wide eyed and apprehensive.

                                     MAN
                         Sorry! We're so sorry. Are you hurt?

                                     WOMAN
                         She's another Babe Ruth. We had no 
                         idea. Are you okay?

               Leopold regards them curiously.

                                     WOMAN
                         What do you have to say for yourself, 
                         Elizabeth?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I'm sorry!

               Leopold stares hard at the modern familial scene. He doesn't 
               speak. After a long moment:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is this your child?

                                     MAN
                         Yes.

               Charlie braces for the worst. The little girl stares at 
               Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     WOMAN
                         C'mon honey, lets go.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I want my ball.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Just a moment!
                              (bending down to 
                              Elizabeth, firmly)
                         Pick a hand.

               She picks his right hand. Nothing. She picks his left. 
               Nothing. Leopold looks surprised then pulls the ball from 
               his ear. She takes the ball and smiles at him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         My mother's name was Elizabeth.
                              (then to her parents)
                         She's a beautiful child. You're very 
                         lucky.

                                     MAN
                         What do you say, Elizabeth?

               Elizabeth makes an embarrassed face.

                                     MAN
                         Thank you.

               Charlie and Leopold continue through the park, Leopold lost 
               in thought. Charlie watches him in surprise. They walk on.

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold talks animatedly. On the table -- Pumpkin pies, pizza 
               pies, and pot pies.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand pumpkin pies, pizza 
                         pies, and pot pies. But I wish someone 
                         would explain Eskimo pies.

               He eats a large spoonful of pudding. Kate and Charlie exchange 
               a worried look.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You smoke Camel's, you wear Old 
                         Spices, and you drink Mountains Dew. 
                         It's revolting.
                              (to Kate)
                         The pudding tonight is excellent. 
                         Another thing I've noticed, everyone 
                         is in a great rush today. Instant 
                         Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick, 
                         Minute Maid. You'll find there's 
                         much to be said for moderation and 
                         languor.

               He eats another spoonful.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Mmmm. Is it tapioca?

                                     KATE
                         It's margarine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (taking the spoon out 
                              of his mouth)
                         It's marvelous.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well, I'm off.

                                     KATE
                         Me too. Work to do. Where are you 
                         going?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine. 
                         It's this coffee house we go to.

                                     KATE
                         Say hello to Dennis for me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Who is that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dennis is this really good looking 
                         friend of mine who doesn't know Kate's 
                         alive because SHE doesn't know how 
                         to flirt.

                                     KATE
                         As a rule I don't like to associate 
                         with really good looking people. It 
                         makes me feel really... I don't 
                         know... Smart. But Dennis is a nice 
                         guy.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And he always picks up the check.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Sounds enjoyable. I shall join you.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What?

                                     KATE
                         That's a wonderful idea! Leopold 
                         mentioned how he wanted to meet... 
                         People of quality was it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ahhhhh?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         If you'd rather I didn't go...

                                     KATE
                         Nonsense! Charlie, you don't want to 
                         hurt Leopold's feelings. He's going 
                         to think you don't want him to go.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh it's not that. It's just that 
                         it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all. 
                         I'm not sure you'd have such a good 
                         time.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A little ribald humor? I'm not as 
                         big a stick in the mud as you might 
                         think! I'd enjoy a gay night out, 
                         kicking up my heels.

               There is an awkward pause. Leopold is so enthusiastic and 
               sincere that despite a feeling of disaster Charlie relents.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Finish off your Parquet and we'll 
                         go.

               Charlie gives Kate a look of death as we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

               Charlie and Leopold approach Caffeine, a trendy coffee house. 
               Charlie looks in the window.

                                     CHARLIE
                         There they all are. Now one more 
                         thing. Throw the words "like" and 
                         "you know" into a sentence whenever 
                         possible. It's how people talk today.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Proper speech does not cease to exist 
                         simply because it is ignored.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Please?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Charles, you needn't fret. I have 
                         the walk down pat. I will not give 
                         myself away. Like.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (looking in the window)
                         Oh shit!
                              (correcting himself)
                         Shoot.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What is it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Patrice. See that girl? The blonde 
                         one? She's so inconceivably hot.

               INT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

               Patrice, a tall blonde sits at a large round table, talking. 
               She is very beautiful.

               EXT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

                                     LEOPOLD
                         She's very pretty.

                                     CHARLIE
                         She's mine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Congratulations.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ok not exactly mine. But I saw her 
                         first.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Okay. I guess we should go in. I 
                         don't suppose we could tell everyone 
                         you don't speak English?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Of course not. Let's go inside.

               Leopold walks his casual walk inside, followed by a very 
               reluctant Charlie.

               INT. CAFFEINE - NIGHT

               Charlie's friends are sitting at a table talking. They are a 
               relaxed and friendly group. Charlie and Leopold approach.

                                     ALL
                              (ad lib greetings)
                         Charlie! Where've you been? etc.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi. Uh everyone, this is my friend, 
                         Leo.

                                     BILL
                         Hey.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Hey.

                                     DENNIS
                         Waz up?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Waz up?

                                     PATRICE
                         How are ya?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How are ya?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (after a beat)
                         Leo's staying with us for a while.

               Charlie pulls out a chair for Leopold but Leopold sits next 
               to Patrice instead. Patrice takes out her cigarettes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         May I?

                                     PATRICE
                         Help yourself.

               Leopold takes a cigarette, lights one for Patrice, then his 
               own.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you, my dear.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (at a loss)
                         Um?...
                              (all look at Charlie)
                         ...I have nothing to say.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You did not tell the truth about 
                         Patrice, Charles.

                                     DENNIS AND BILL
                         CHARLES??

                                     CHARLIE
                         What did I tell you, LEO?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         He informed me you were inconceivably 
                         HOT, but I think you're lovely. 
                         Exceptionally lovely.

                                     PATRICE
                         Thank you, Leo.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to the waitress)
                         Check please.

               INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

               The subway car is inhabited solely by Leopold, Charlie, and 
               the oldest Ukrainian woman in New York City. Despite the 
               fact that the train is empty, they are all seated on the 
               same bench.

               Charlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at 
               Leopold. The Ukrainian woman hangs on every word.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Just drop it Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But Charles, it is so ridiculous. I 
                         am not interested in her.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hah!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         In any case the problem is not with 
                         me but with you.
                              (quietly)
                         You have no idea what it takes to go 
                         about courting a woman. From what 
                         I've witnessed tonight, it is 
                         symptomatic of your entire generation.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (almost speechless)
                         You are some piece of work, Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Now I do not wish to get personal...

               Charlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the old 
               woman. She rolls her eyes.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But you have been of great assistance 
                         to me and I feel this is one area 
                         where I can be of some real help.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm fascinated. Go on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Now, why was I successful with this 
                         young lady and why did you so 
                         miserably fail?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What makes you think she likes you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Well she gave me the number of her 
                         telephone and I assumed it meant...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Go on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         As I see it, the girl hasn't an 
                         inkling of your intentions. And it's 
                         no wonder. You, Charles, are a Merry 
                         Andrew.

                                     CHARLIE
                         A what?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A Merry Andrew.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I am not!!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Everything plays like a farce to 
                         you. The more wit, the less courage. 
                         I believe the modern woman desires 
                         passion, protection, sensitivity. No 
                         woman wants to be romanced by a 
                         buffoon.
                              (the old woman shakes 
                              her head)
                         Banter and repartee are fine but you 
                         must add to that a different sort of 
                         playfulness.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You think I should pounce?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm saying you must treat her with 
                         respect. Any oaf can attempt a crude 
                         pass. A woman of Kate's stature would 
                         never respond to an artificial tactic.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You said Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I did not.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes you did. Didn't he say Kate?

               The old woman nods.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         We are discussing your problem.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not anymore. You like my sister.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Charles...

                                     CHARLIE
                         She has trouble with men, you know.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps she has not met the right 
                         one.

                                     CHARLIE
                         She has met the right one. HUNDREDS 
                         of times. But she pulls back. She 
                         cuts herself off. You turn around 
                         and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         One never can tell.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Does Kate know how you feel?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Have you made your intentions known 
                         to her?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who's the Merry Andrew now?! I think 
                         you're all talk and no action. What 
                         are you waiting for?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I do not know if there is a future 
                         in it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well Leopold, no one ever does...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Kate enters with an arm load of Leopold's discarded clothes. 
               She drops them on his bed and begins to hang them in his 
               closet.

               A notebook falls from his pants pocket. She puts it on the 
               bureau. A beat. She quickly picks it up, sits on the edge of 
               the bed and starts to read.

                                     KATE
                              (reading out loud)
                         Royal family -- Uncouth. Making Out -- 
                         slow soulful kissing... Woman as 
                         equals??

               She flips a page.

                                     KATE
                         Who drove the Chevy to the levy and 
                         why was it dry?

               Kate smiles. She flips the page.

                                     KATE
                         Eyes shine when she talks about... 
                         science. Raises her voice when she 
                         knows she's wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY, 
                         BOSSY. Lose my train of thought when 
                         I see her smile. Most beautiful when 
                         she's angry. Honorable heart... 
                         Peasant feet.

               The front door is heard slamming. Kate, alarmed, stuffs the 
               notebook back in Leopold's pocket. She races to the door; 
               glances back at the notebook, turns off the light and scurries 
               from the room.

               INT. HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

               The corridor is darkly lit. Kate leaves the bathroom as 
               Leopold enters. They collide and separate but remain close 
               together. Both are dressed in pajamas and speak softly.

                                     KATE
                         Ooops. Bread and butter.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What's that?

                                     KATE
                         Bread and butter. It's an old 
                         saying... Well not to you I guess. 
                         You say it when you pass someone in 
                         a cramped space. As close as bread 
                         and butter.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     KATE
                         So. Did you have a good time last 
                         night?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It was very interesting.

                                     KATE
                         Did you find that person of quality?

               Leopold looks at her a moment.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes. I did.

                                     KATE
                         Well... fine.
                              (there is a pause)
                         I guess it's time to turn in.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes.

                                     KATE
                         Goodnight.

               She reaches her door. Leopold stops her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate?

               She turns. Leopold grasps for the words but the habit of 
               inaction returns.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Goodnight.
                              (he slowly closes the 
                              door)

               INT. PATRICE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Charlie stands at Patrice's door with a large painting. He 
               looks over at Leopold hiding the next doorway over. Charlie 
               knocks. She opens the door.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi. I brought you some flowers.

               He hands her the flower filled painting.

                                     PATRICE
                         Charlie!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Miss Wochuchowski? I was wondering 
                         if you would do me the great honor 
                         of accompanying me to the cinema 
                         tonight. And allowing me the privilege 
                         of escorting you to dinner afterwards.

               Patrice shyly studies the painting.

                                     PATRICE
                         It's beautiful.

               Charlie quickly looks at Leopold pleadingly. He really does 
               not want to say this next part. Leopold, however, is adamant.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (deadpan)
                         Gracing me with your conversation 
                         and company would mean the world to 
                         me.

               There is a long pause. Patrice watches Charlie in disbelief.

                                     PATRICE
                         Um... 7:00?

                                     CHARLIE
                         7:00 is fine. I'll call for you then.

               They smile at each other for a long moment.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (silently mouthing)
                         Goodbye.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Goodbye.
                              (she closes the door)
                         It worked!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Of course it did.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Leopold, I... I'm... I have no idea 
                         what to do next!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Charles. Leave everything to me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not so fast, buddy. You're next.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Kate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time 
               and space. Leopold enters. He is suddenly embarrassed and 
               doesn't know how to proceed.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good morning.

                                     KATE
                         Good morning. You're up early.

               She moves to her computer on the other side of the room. 
               Leopold follows. Before she can sit down, Leopold pulls out 
               her chair. She falls to the ground. He rushes to her side 
               immediately.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm terribly sorry!!

                                     KATE
                         Happens all the time...

               She opens a reference book and slowly begins typing at her 
               computer. There is a pause.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles?... ah, Kate? I was 
                         wondering...

               She stops working and looks at Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         What it is you're working on.

                                     KATE
                         Oh. It's my computer.

               She resumes her work.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see. Actually I meant the work 
                         itself.

                                     KATE
                         I'm researching the correlations 
                         between your time and the present.

               Leopold stares blankly.

                                     KATE
                         I'm TRYING to get you home, Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh.

               Charlie peaks in, signaling Leopold, spurring him on.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I have never seen a woman work as 
                         diligently and extensively before.

                                     KATE
                         It's made me the man I am today.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It's quite a beautiful day, have you 
                         noticed? Perhaps you would permit 
                         yourself some time off and grant me 
                         the privilege of escorting you around 
                         the city this fine Spring afternoon.

                                     KATE
                         Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I've 
                         got too much work to do. Ask Charlie 
                         though. He'll go with you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the 
                         same. It is YOUR company I am seeking.

               Surprised, Kate turns around and looks at Leopold.

                                     KATE
                              (gently)
                         Oh, Leopold. I'm so sorry. I can't.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see. Some other time then.

                                     KATE
                         Yes... Thank you.

               Leopold sits at the far end of the room. Kate takes a moment 
               then resumes typing. She STOPS and sits back in her chair. 
               After a long moment, she subtly unplugs the computer with 
               her foot and starts banging on the top of it.

                                     KATE
                         Oh for crying out loud. Would you 
                         look at this? Leopold? The computer's 
                         on the blink again.
                              (she bangs harder)
                         Cheap piece of equipment. I can't...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Maybe if you...

                                     KATE
                         NO, no, it does this all the time. 
                         Just have to wait it out.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     KATE
                         Darn.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         ...Perhaps it is a sign?

                                     KATE
                         Oh, you think?
                              (she smiles at Leopold)

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Leopold trots his horse expertly along the horse path. Kate 
               follows, clutching the horses neck, bouncing like a clown.

                                     KATE
                         I... I must have gotten a funny 
                         horse...

               Leopold turns and rides around Kate.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Allow me.

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

               Bethesda fountain. Boats on Central Park Lake. Couples in 
               Sheeps Meadow.

               Holding the reins of Kate's horse in one hand, Leopold grasps 
               Kate's waist with the other as they ride a single horse 
               through the greenery of Central Park.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - THE THALIA - DAY

               A revival house. On the Marquee: "The Tenuous Duke" starring 
               Ronald Coleman.

               INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

               Kate and Leopold eat popcorn, Milk Duds, M & M's, and large 
               drinks. The lights go down and the movie begins.

               The enormity of the medium strikes Leopold at once. He 
               involuntarily leans back in his chair grabbing Kate's 
               shoulder, watching attentively. After a bit:

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is that supposed to be my hair? Do 
                         you see how they think my hair looks?

               Kate looks over at Leopold and nods. Through his eyes, she 
               too experiences movies for the first time. She moves close 
               to him.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Grammercy Park, The Guggenheim Museum, Central Park Plaza, 
               The Metropolitan Museum.

               EXT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM - DAY

               Kate and Leopold bound up the steps, entering the museum.

               INT. MUSEUM - DAY

               Modern art exhibit. Leopold stares blankly at an empty white 
               canvas. He turns to Kate questioningly.

                                     KATE
                         That's simplicity in it's purest 
                         form. It speaks volumes in it's 
                         nothingness. Whiteness representing 
                         emptiness. Hopelessness. It's bleak. 
                         Bleak!

               Leopold eyes the painting skeptically. They move to the next 
               object d'art. A toilet.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Aaand this represents...?

               They burst into giddy laughter.

                                     KATE
                         Absolutely nothing.

               They round the corner, moving to the next room. Leopold's 
               smile fades.

               CLOSE UP: A painting of privileged Victorian society.

               Shaken, he gazes at a painting in a dream-like state.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (very quietly)
                         I'd almost forgotten how beautiful 
                         it was. Truly. Beautiful.

               Kate smiles sadly at Leopold. They slowly walk out.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               We hear keys in the lock and laughter outside as Kate and 
               Leopold enter.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (laughing)
                         M & M's, CBS, FBI.

                                     KATE
                         VIP, VHS, VCR.

               They collapse on the couch.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ.

                                     KATE
                         I don't know. K.D. Lang.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I don't know how you keep up with 
                         it. I'm exhausted.

                                     KATE
                         So am I.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'll tell you what. Why don't I 
                         prepare dinner tomorrow night? I 
                         never have before. I mean even before 
                         I hit town. "Hit town" How's that? I 
                         can't imagine what it'll taste like, 
                         but I don't think it will be any 
                         worse than your cooking.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I see.

                                     KATE
                         A blind date.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh, I'm so sorry.

                                     KATE
                         No, that just means I haven't met 
                         him before. It was set up through 
                         friends.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Ah!

                                     KATE
                         A hazard of single life... I'm turning 
                         in.

               Kate gets up. Leopold automatically stands.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Another time then.

                                     KATE
                         I'm sorry.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It's quite all right.

               As she gets to the door, she stops.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold? I had a wonderful time today. 
                         I can't remember the last time I 
                         took the day off and just played. 
                         I'd forgotten how beautiful this 
                         city can be... I want to thank you 
                         for that.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The pleasure was mine.

               Kate smiles at Leopold and goes out.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlie, in a tie, is standing with Leopold at the dining 
               room table. Kate wearing too much makeup for her date, runs 
               into the bathroom in a BRIGHT RED DRESS.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold. 
                         Are you sure you can teach me 
                         everything there is to know?

                                     KATE
                              (from the bathroom)
                         Just don't swipe the silverware and 
                         give yourself away.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Nobody's talking to you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is very simple. I will be your 
                         date. Just behave as you normally 
                         would and I'll correct you along the 
                         way. Now, escort me in.

               Charlie and Leopold move across the room. After a beat, 
               Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first. 
               Leopold gives his approval. Kate rushes out of the bathroom 
               in a tight BLACK dress.

               Leopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table. Charlie 
               sits down, pleased. Leopold remains standing, incensed.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now what?

               Leopold takes a cloth napkin, hits Charlie upside the head. 
               Hard.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Pull the chair for a lady! Clod.

                                     KATE (V.O.)
                         No name calling.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to Kate)
                         Well, really!

               Charlie stands up and pulls out the chair. As Leopold sits, 
               Charlie pushes the chair in to hard.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're not shoveling coal into a 
                         furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in 
                         gently. Gently. Try it again.

               Charlie gently glides Leopold to the table. He remains 
               standing, not sure what to do next.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Well, sit down!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now don't burst a vein or anything, 
                         but there are quite a few knives and 
                         forks here. How do I know what each 
                         one's for?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Merely start from the outside and 
                         work your way in.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What kind of beer should I order?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Beer!

                                     CHARLIE
                         I WAS KIDDING!

                                     KATE
                         How do I look?

               Leopold and Charlie stand. Kate poses in the gown picked out 
               by Leopold. Leopold smiles brightly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You look exquisite, Katherine.

                                     KATE
                              (almost sadly)
                         Thank you, Leopold.

               She looks at Leopold not knowing what to say. Finally

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is a tie I'm wearing.

                                     KATE
                         You look very nice, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes. I know.

               The doorbell rings.

                                     KATE
                         That must be him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Your bland date?

                                     KATE
                         Blind date.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Remember to breathe, Kate. And don't 
                         use to many big words. You'll scare 
                         the poor slob away.

                                     KATE
                              (moving to the door)
                         This is always the scary part.
                              (she sings)
                         "Open the door to my, Mystery Date."

               She opens the door and looks straight up. Leopold and Charlie 
               peer in closer to get a better look. In the doorway stands 
               LARRY, great looking, very tall, a winner.

                                     LARRY
                         Hi. Kate?

                                     KATE
                         Larry?

               Kate turns back to the others with a frozen smile.

                                     KATE
                         Well, I'm off.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (giving Larry the 
                              once over)
                         Kate, may I have a word with you?

                                     KATE
                         Now?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes.
                              (as they cross the 
                              room)
                         I DON'T like the look of him.

                                     KATE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Cad. I can spot one a mile away.
                              (he helps her with 
                              her coat)
                         I shall escort you out myself. I 
                         will act as your chaperone.

                                     KATE
                         That isn't necessary. I'll be fine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is no trouble.

                                     KATE
                         Goodnight, Leopold.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         But...

                                     KATE
                         Goodnight.

               She is gone. Leopold stares after her, dejected.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               Kate and Larry are led to their table. Larry sits down. Kate 
               remains standing.

                                     LARRY
                              (friendly)
                         Sit down.

                                     KATE
                              (sighs)
                         Thank you.
                              (she sits)

                                     LARRY
                         So. How am I doing?

                                     KATE
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     LARRY
                         How am I doing? First date. You 
                         pleased? You disappointed?

                                     KATE
                         Undecided.

                                     LARRY
                         I see.

               He snaps his fingers to get the waiters attention startling 
               Kate. She laughs nervously.

                                     LARRY
                         So. What did Jeannie say about me?

                                     KATE
                         About you? Ah, she said you were 
                         tall.

                                     LARRY
                         6'3.

                                     KATE
                         And nice looking.

                                     LARRY
                         Thank you.

                                     KATE
                         Thank her. And that you persevere 
                         ardently on Wall Street.

                                     LARRY
                         Well, I work there...

                                     KATE
                              (after a beat)
                         That must be very interesting.

                                     LARRY
                              (laughing)
                         You've obviously never worked on 
                         Wall Street.

                                     KATE
                              (laughing along for 
                              the hell of it)
                         No.

               Their laughter subsides. After a beat:

                                     LARRY
                         What else did Jeannie say about me?

               INT. THE FOUR SEASONS - NIGHT

               The Maitre d' of this very fancy restaurant shows Charlie 
               and Patrice to their seats. Charlie motions Patrice to go 
               first just as Leopold has instructed.

               The Maitre de pulls out Patrice's chair. Charlie gives him a 
               look to back off. Charlie effortlessly glides Patrice to the 
               table and takes his seat.

                                     PATRICE
                         Have I told you how much I liked 
                         your painting?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (beaming)
                         Twice.

                                     PATRICE
                         If you get tired of hearing about 
                         it, let me know. I have to admit I 
                         was sort of surprised when you called. 
                         I didn't think you liked me, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         When I first saw you, I thought...
                              (he makes his jaw 
                              drop down to the 
                              floor)

                                     PATRICE
                         What do you think now?

               Charlie smiles and places her hand over his heart. Then he 
               makes his jaw drop again. Patrice laughs happily.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               Kate and Larry are eating their dinner.

                                     KATE
                         Aaand that's about all Jeannie said. 
                         What did Jeannie say about me?

                                     LARRY
                              (smiling)
                         She said you were enormously sexy, 
                         had a great body, but you don't put 
                         out.

                                     KATE
                         Quite a compelling portrait.

                                     LARRY
                              (turning on the charm)
                         Would you say it's an accurate 
                         portrait?

                                     KATE
                              (leaning into Larry)
                         A masterpiece.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold slowly carries a dinner tray to the dinning room 
               table. He moves to the window and looks out. After a while 
               he pours a glass of wine.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               As they eat their dinner Larry drones on.

                                     LARRY
                         So this guy wants to invest $50,000 
                         in a stock that's no good. Here's 
                         what I do...

               Kate stares absentmindedly at Larry, her mind somewhere else. 
               She looks down at the fork in her hand. She switches to the 
               proper one, reflecting on Leopold's etiquette. She notices 
               her napkin lying flat on the table. She reaches for it.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap. He begins 
               to eat his dinner. Slowly. Elegantly. Alone.

               INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

               Kate places the napkin on her lap. She stares at it a long 
               while. Finally she looks up at Larry.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP OF LARRY

                                     LARRY
                         I'm telling you the guy was a DICK! 
                         A total ASSHOLE!

                                     KATE
                              (jarred awake)
                         Who?

                                     LARRY
                         Jeff Murray. The guy I've been talking 
                         about. Hello?

                                     KATE
                              (realizing her feelings 
                              for Leopold, smiling 
                              radiantly at Larry)
                         Goodbye.

               Then as she leaves, a parting shot.

                                     KATE
                         Don't get up.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Sound of keys in the lock, then Kate bursts through the door.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?

               The living room is dark and empty. She goes through the living 
               room, past the hallway, into the bedroom.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?

               His bedroom is empty. He is not there.

                                     KATE
                         Oh, Leopold...

               She runs into Charlie's studio and stops short.

               Next to Charlie's stern paintings, Leopold's portrait of 
               Kate shines in the moonlight. She wears an antique dress. 
               She is lovely. Kate sees herself as Leopold sees her and is 
               touched. She turns and collides head on with Leopold.

                                     KATE
                         Oh!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Bread and butter.

               He is wearing gloves and an apron. He rubs his bruised head, 
               inadvertently leaving a trail of suds along his face.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You're back early. Did you enjoy 
                         your date?

                                     KATE
                              (happily)
                         No.

               She moves in close, trying to remove the soap from his face.

                                     KATE
                         Here, you've got some...

               He wipes his face making it much worse.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is it gone?

                                     KATE
                              (laughing)
                         No.

               She uses the apron to wipe away the soap. They gaze at each 
               other and become serious.

                                     KATE
                              (softly)
                         A funny thing happened to me on my 
                         bland date this evening, Leopold. I 
                         really can't explain it. This puffed-
                         up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn 
                         kept popping into my mind all night 
                         long at the most inopportune times. 
                         I couldn't get rid of him.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How inconsiderate.

                                     KATE
                         Yeah, it was. The harder I tried, 
                         the more persistent he became. He's 
                         conceited and inflated and unseasoned 
                         and it doesn't seem to matter... 
                         He's 134 years old but I can't get 
                         him out of my head.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is he there right now?

                                     KATE
                         Right here. Larger than life.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'll protect you...

               They kiss. A long romantic passionate kiss.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Dr. Coles, would you grant me license 
                         to dine with you tomorrow evening at 
                         eight o'clock?

                                     KATE
                         Permission granted.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Until tomorrow, then.

               They separate. A beat. Leopold gestures for Kate to go first. 
               They head down the hallway together into their separate rooms.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               The table clock chimes eight times. Leopold enters from the 
               kitchen dressed perfectly in the most UP TO DATE style. He 
               carries a casserole dish.

               A second later Kate enters from the hallway. She is wearing 
               an OLD FASHIONED, ANTIQUE DRESS. She looks lovely.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (a little startled)
                         You look beautiful.

                                     KATE
                         YOU do. What have you got there?

               Leopold opens the casserole dish.

                                     KATE
                         Hamburger Helper!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I know you like it.

               Kate smiles. She looks behind him into the kitchen. A COLOSSAL 
               MESS. Leopold lights the candles and pulls out her chair. 
               This time she's prepared. He slides her chair to the table.

               INT. LIVING ROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT

               The candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow 
               throughout the apartment. Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful 
               World" plays. Kate and Leopold sit on the couch sipping wine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Tell me more.

                                     KATE
                         Um, where was I? So after my father 
                         died I had to go to work.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Have you had many jobs?

                                     KATE
                         Many. I got fired from all of them. 
                         I'm the most unskilled person I know. 
                         But they were just survival jobs 
                         while I was still in school. I always 
                         knew I wanted to go into science 
                         like my father. And I did.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Do you miss him?

                                     KATE
                         I think about him every day. He was 
                         courtly, just like you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I think you are a remarkable woman 
                         Katherine Coles.

                                     KATE
                         You just don't get out much. You'd 
                         be surprised how remarkable I'm not.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No, it is you who would be surprised.

               They kiss. Anxiously they stare into each other's eyes. They 
               kiss again. Slowly, Kate leads him to her bedroom door. They 
               look at each other, deciding.

               Deliberately, cautiously, Kate opens the door.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate...

               Kate puts her fingers over Leopold's lips. Gently she leads 
               him inside. They slowly embrace as the door closes.

               INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

               Sunlight floods the room. Clothes are scattered about. Two 
               figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed. One of the 
               figures rolls around. The covers are pulled back revealing:

                                     CHARLIE
                         Good morning.

                                     PATRICE
                         Morning.

               They kiss.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

               Leopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee. The table is 
               set for a huge breakfast. Kate also in a robe enters from 
               the hallway. There is a moment of awkwardness as they see 
               each other for the first time.

                                     KATE
                         Morning.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good morning.

               They kiss shyly. Kate notices the feast.

                                     KATE
                         Look what you've done!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It's nothing.

                                     KATE
                         Nothing? My own mother never made me 
                         a breakfast like this.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will have to have a talk with her.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate...

                                     KATE
                         About last night...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Please sit down.

               He pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate, I had never before been a 
                         considerate man. I had, with 
                         astonishing complacency, squandered 
                         my life, waiting for some incentive 
                         to force me into action. You have 
                         made me see how rare our time here 
                         really is. I am most beholden to you 
                         Kate. And always will be.

                                     KATE
                         I sense the word "BUT" entering into 
                         this any minute now.

               Leopold takes her hands in his. She looks at him defensively, 
               bracing for worst.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming 
                         my wife.

               Kate lets out a very girlish, high pitched scream

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Shall I take that as a "yes"?

                                     KATE
                         Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry 
                         you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I love you, Kate.

                                     KATE
                         That's entirely beside the point... 
                         You're moving way too fast here. 
                         Shouldn't we date first? I mean it's 
                         obvious the first one went well...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Where I come from that's pretty much 
                         the way it works.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, even though last night we... 
                         loved each other, that doesn't mean 
                         this morning we're engaged. It just 
                         doesn't work that way now.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (taking a ring off 
                              his fingers and 
                              placing it on hers)
                         I have loved you since I first set 
                         eyes on you. I cannot imagine my 
                         life without you beside me. I want 
                         to marry you, Kate and make an honest 
                         woman of you.

                                     KATE
                         Oh Leopold, sit down.

               They switch places. Leopold sits and Kate kneels beside him.

                                     KATE
                         Relationships these days are much 
                         more complicated than that. Women 
                         today have certain freedoms that men 
                         have been taking advantage of for 
                         centuries. You must have been aware 
                         of that. If you think about it 
                         clearly, it should be obvious to you 
                         that marriage between us is out of 
                         the question.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Do you not love me Kate?

                                     KATE
                              (almost inaudible)
                         Don't ever think that...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Then consider my proposal.

                                     KATE
                         I'll think it over but I can tell 
                         you now the answer is...

               He kisses her. It's impressive.

                                     KATE
                              (out of breath)
                         Possibly.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (a knowing smile)
                         I need you beside me. I will not 
                         give up easily.

                                     KATE
                              (smiling)
                         Do what you have to do...

               Charlie enters. Kate and Leopold become extremely 
               selfconscious.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Morning.

                                     LEOPOLD AND KATE
                              (too casual and too 
                              chipper)
                         Morning!

               Charlie is immediately aware that something is not quite 
               right. He studies the two of them and nonchalant sits at the 
               table. Kate and Leopold serve themselves breakfast.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (to Kate)
                         Coffee?

               Kate nods. As Leopold pours, they look at each other shyly.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (after a pause)
                         I would like some coffee.

                                     KATE
                         Of course. Say when.

               She pours Charlie's coffee until it overflows.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (deadpan)
                         When.

                                     KATE
                         Sorry.

               As Kate wipes up the table, Charlie notices her ring. He 
               eyes Leopold suspiciously. Leopold concentrates on his plate.

               Charlie gives Kate a questioning glance. She smiles at him, 
               looking both innocent and guilty at the same time. After a 
               beat:

                                     CHARLIE
                         Uh huh.

               All smile privately and sip their coffee without another 
               word.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - NIGHT

               Buried behind open books and crumpled up paper, Kate labors 
               in earnest.

               She stops suddenly, almost violently, and studies the notes 
               in front of her. The coffee cup falls from her hand and 
               breaks.

                                     DR. KAY
                              (calling from her 
                              office)
                         Kate, are you all right?

                                     KATE
                         Fine! I'm fine.

               She covers her papers and self consciously cleans up her 
               mess. She sits down slowly and peeks at her notes. She has 
               SOLVED THE PUZZLE that will send Leopold back.

               She looks up in disbelief and glances through her window 
               around the lab. Everyone is hard at work. Helplessly, she 
               stares back at the paper on her desk.

               She pulls open her drawer and takes out the picture of 
               Carlson. She stares at it for a long time. She opens her 
               mouth to call for the others, stops, and looks at the photo.

               Slowly, with great indecision, Kate crumples up the paper. 
               She returns the picture to the drawer. After a long moment, 
               she opens a book, feigning research, her mind a million miles 
               away.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Leopold and Kate sit on her bed watching David Lettering. 
               Kate clutches her pillow close to her. She looks over at 
               Leopold concentrating on the TV with furrowed brow. She smiles 
               sadly. She takes her pillow and flings it off her bed. She 
               snuggles up to Leopold. They watch TV. Together.

               EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY

               Central Park in full bloom, Botanical Gardens, The Frock 
               Museum.

               INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

               Leopold and Kate eat lunch. Leopold scans a newspaper. On 
               the TV over the bar, Bob Dole is speaking out against gun 
               control.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Public office is apparently still 
                         the last refuge for the incompetent. 
                         Show me a man who does not want his 
                         gun registered and I'll show you a 
                         man who should not own a gun. What 
                         is a pee-pee girl?

                                     KATE
                         What are you reading?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The Village Voice. After much 
                         consideration, I have decided it is 
                         time I join the work force.

                                     KATE
                         As a pee-pee girl?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps not that, but I am determined 
                         to acquire honest employment.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold, I don't know if that's such 
                         a good idea.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate, my life back home was beneficial 
                         to no one. I want my new life to 
                         have value. I won't make the same 
                         mistakes twice.

                                     KATE
                         You have to be patient.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I could conceivably wait my whole 
                         life away.

                                     KATE
                         You're awfully cute when you get 
                         causey.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will not waste any more time. I 
                         must make a difference.

               INT. BLOOMINGDALES - DAY

               Customers fill the aisles. In the center of it all, Leopold 
               is hard at work. He holds a bottle of perfume.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Try our fragrance? Would you like to 
                         try our new fragrance today?

                                     RICH CUSTOMER
                         What is it?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is called, POISON.

               He squirts some at her.

                                     RICH CUSTOMER
                         Oh! I don't think so. Have you got 
                         PASSION?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     RICH CUSTOMER
                         Elizabeth Taylor's Passion?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Next aisle over.

               She leaves. Leopold looks after her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (after a beat)
                         Give your mother-in-law what she 
                         really deserves this season. Give 
                         her some POISON.

               INT. KATE'S LABORATORY OFFICE - MORNING

               The doctors enter Kate's office and closes the door.

                                     KATE
                         Hi.
                              (the doctors remain 
                              silent)
                         What's the matter?

               There is a long pause. Slowly Kate realizes the doctors are 
               on to her. She puts down her pen.

                                     KATE
                         So you know.

                                     DR. KAU
                         We had to go through your computer 
                         to access information. Your 
                         calculations have been verified and 
                         the final course has been set. Leopold 
                         goes back a week from Friday 1:17 
                         a.m.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         How long were you going to keep it a 
                         secret, Kate?

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Were you even going to tell us at 
                         all?

                                     KATE
                         I'm not sure.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Not sure? What can you be thinking? 
                         You can't alter the course of history 
                         and assume everything will be okay. 
                         It won't be. He has his own destiny 
                         to fulfill in his own time.

                                     KATE
                              (quietly)
                         You don't understand.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                              (gently)
                         He's going back, Kate.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         It's over.

               Kate nods. The doctors slowly leave the room and close the 
               door. Just the sound of the clock ticking.

               Kate sits at her desk very still.

                                     KATE
                         No... No, no, no.

               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

               Charlie knocks and enters.

                                     CHARLIE
                         There you are. I've only been 
                         hollering for the last...

               He sees her face. Kate's eyes are red and swollen. She lays 
               out Leopold's belongings.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate? What is it? What happened?

                                     KATE
                              (very detached)
                         It's time. Leopold's going back.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate...

                                     KATE
                         Yup. I'll get his things together. 
                         Tell him tonight.

               He goes to her.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Are you all right?

                                     KATE
                              (pulling away)
                         I'm fine.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You don't look so fine.

                                     KATE
                         Well I am. It was wonderful having 
                         him here, Charlie. He was of 
                         invaluable assistance to the project.
                              (she shrugs)
                         I'll miss him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You'll miss him?

                                     KATE
                         I will.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Goddamnit Kate, you love the guy!

               Kate remains silent.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Kate, don't do this. Please. It's 
                         not right.

                                     KATE
                         What am I supposed to DO, Charlie?? 
                         I can't go back. He can't stay. I 
                         can't let him go. I'm not equipped 
                         to deal with this, Charlie. I don't 
                         know how.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Listen to me, Kate. Don't! Don't be 
                         the ice princess.

                                     KATE
                              (beginning to tear up)
                         I'm not!

                                     CHARLIE
                         You are. You can't live your whole 
                         life under a microscope. You've got 
                         to tell him how you feel.

                                     KATE
                              (breaking down in his 
                              arms)
                         It's too much, Charlie. It's just 
                         too much.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You owe it to him.

                                     KATE
                         I didn't know I could feel like this. 
                         I really didn't know.

               INT. FANCY FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

                                     LEOPOLD
                         So I looked him right in the eye and 
                         said, 'Ego is nature's compensation 
                         for mediocrity.' I turned and I 
                         walked. He never said a word... He 
                         probably didn't understand it... 
                         Kate?

                                     KATE
                              (cold)
                         What?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Are you all right? You're awfully 
                         quiet.

                                     KATE
                         I'm fine.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         How was your day?

                                     KATE
                              (taking a long pause)
                         It's time.

               Leopold looks at her.

                                     KATE
                         We're sending you back.

                                     LEOPOLD
                              (slowly pushing his 
                              plate away)
                         When?

                                     KATE
                         A week from Friday, early morning.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         No!

                                     KATE
                         It was a mistake, Leopold. It's out 
                         of our hands. We can't POCKET people 
                         from history like stolen jewels. We 
                         haven't the right... I'm sorry. We'll 
                         miss you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is that all?

                                     KATE
                         What do you want me to do, fall apart? 
                         You'd still be leaving. It wouldn't 
                         solve anything.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Who is this woman sitting across 
                         from me?

                                     KATE
                         What do you want me to say, Leopold?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Tell me that you love me as I love 
                         you. Let me hear you say it.

               Kate remains silent. Leopold abruptly throws money on the 
               table.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will not do this. I'm sorry.

               We starts out.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold!

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Leopold walks out of the restaurant trying to remain calm. 
               His emotions get the best of him. Finally, exhausted, he 
               winds up walking along Central Park South.

               Hansom Carriages wait to be taken out. He approaches slowly. 
               He stops along side one of the cabs and strokes the horse's 
               head.

               He looks at the horse for a long time. Then he looks at the 
               skyscrapers surrounding him, deciding what to do. He lays 
               his face against the horse's head, torn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

               Kate sits at the dinning room table behind empty Sara Lee 
               boxes, pints of ice cream, beer bottles, and is working her 
               way through the cookie dough. Leopold enters through the 
               front door, DISHEVELED.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Good God. Look at you. You look awful.

                                     KATE
                         You should see what I'm looking at.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I went back to the restaurant. They 
                         told me you went out looking for me 
                         right after I left.

                                     KATE
                         That was pound cakes ago. Where were 
                         you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I had a lot to think over.

                                     KATE
                         Such as?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Just where I stand around here.

               There is a long pause.

                                     KATE
                              (quietly)
                         We should have come up with something 
                         together. I might have been spared 
                         ten or seventy pounds.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Is that an apology?

                                     KATE
                         I'm sorry for what I said.

               Leopold goes to her. He gently prys cookie dough from her 
               hands.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm not going anywhere.

                                     KATE
                         Yes you are...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'm not going. I'm staying here with 
                         you.

                                     KATE
                         But? You can't! We have no right 
                         to...

                                     LEOPOLD
                         It is my destiny. It is my decision.

                                     KATE
                         Have you thought about what you'd be 
                         sacrificing? Your influence? Your 
                         authority?

               They kiss.

                                     KATE
                         Your family, your whole way of life, 
                         everything?

               They kiss.

                                     KATE
                         You're not just feeling sorry for me 
                         because I ate the contents of the 
                         refrigerator, are you?

               They kiss.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I love you, Kate. The single most 
                         miraculous event in my life was not 
                         how I arrived here, but that when I 
                         did, I found you.

                                     KATE
                              (overwhelmed)
                         Here comes the mushy part!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         After much consideration I've come 
                         to the conclusion I no longer desire 
                         a large estate with a full staff and 
                         ornate grounds.

                                     KATE
                         That's good, because if you're staying 
                         I'll probably get fired again. What 
                         do you desire?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         A beautiful wife, a small home in 
                         the middle of nowhere, lots of 
                         children, and fine schools with PMS 
                         meetings every other Sunday.

                                     KATE
                         ...PTA?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         PTA.

                                     KATE
                         I love you too. I do, Leopold. I 
                         love you, too.

               They kiss.

               INT. LABORATORY - DAY

               Leopold and Kate sit calm and resolute. The doctors are in 
               an uproar.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         This is outrageous! I won't allow 
                         it!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The decision is not yours to make.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         Do you realize what you're saying? 
                         You're tampering with fate, 
                         preordinance, and God himself.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         We do that every day, doctor. It is 
                         called CHOICE.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Dr. Carlson is still over there. You 
                         can't simply abandon her. We have to 
                         get her back.

                                     KATE
                         Do you think I'm not aware of that? 
                         Do you think a minute goes by that I 
                         don't feel responsible for her? But 
                         SOMEONE ELSE CAN GO.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Only one person can return. The 
                         capsule accommodates only one person. 
                         Leopold has to find her.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Perhaps she does not wish to return. 
                         Perhaps she's found greater happiness 
                         in her new life. It happened to me.

                                     KATE
                         Maybe this is her destiny. Maybe 
                         she's of more important use back 
                         there.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Julia Carlson died in the Center 
                         Factory fire of 1897, two years after 
                         she arrived. She was 37 years old.

               There is a stunned silence.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Dear lord.

                                     DR. KAU
                         She was a friend, Kate. She was never 
                         expected to sacrifice her life for 
                         this experiment. I won't be a party 
                         to it. I know what I'm asking... 
                         There's no way we can force you to 
                         go. Just think it over.

               INT. BEDROOM - 2:30 A.M.

               A clock is ticking loudly. Kate and Leopold lie back to back.

                                     KATE
                         You're going back aren't you?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I keep seeing that poor woman's face. 
                         She was terrified.

                                     KATE
                         You said you wouldn't leave me... 
                         I've never been lucky. Not one time.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Six months ago I wouldn't have given 
                         it another thought. I wouldn't have 
                         lost a moment's sleep. You've changed 
                         me, Kate. There is no turning back.

                                     KATE
                         I wouldn't WANT you to change. That's 
                         what's tearing me up inside. Either 
                         way I lose... You've changed me too. 
                         I can't go back to my old life 
                         anymore. I can't live like that again. 
                         God my heart is pounding like a drum. 
                         I've never been so scared in my life. 
                         Take me with you, Leopold. God. Take 
                         me with you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You don't realize what you're saying! 
                         You don't understand the kind of 
                         life you'd lead. What you'd be giving 
                         up.

                                     KATE
                         I'd be with you.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I can't ask that of you.

                                     KATE
                         Just ask me... Just ask.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Come back with me.

               She slowly turns. She embraces him.

                                     KATE
                         Yes!

               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - NIGHT

               Dressed to the nines, Leopold leads a blindfolded Kate through 
               the street. She is clumsier than usual.

                                     KATE
                         Where are you taking me?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This is something I've wanted to do 
                         for a long time.

               She takes off her blindfold and looks up at the sign: 
               ROSELAND.

                                     KATE
                         Leopold?

                                     LEOPOLD
                         This will be very therapeutic.

               He takes her arm and escorts her in.

               INT. ROSELAND - NIGHT

               Leopold leads Kate to the dance floor. He opens his arms and 
               Kate steps in the way she was taught in class. Leopold pulls 
               her close.

               This time there is no pretending. Partnered together, they 
               shine. They move beautifully, effortlessly. It's almost more 
               than they can bear. As the music plays, they stop. Leopold 
               holds Kate tightly. They look at each other for the longest 
               time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LABORATORY - EARLY MORNING

               Large screen computers are working overtime. Kate, Leopold, 
               and Charlie accompany the doctors to the capsule. It is nearly 
               time.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         The time tables have been set. Just 
                         strap yourself in and you'll be fine.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         You have only a twenty four hour 
                         leeway before the machine is set to 
                         return to us. You must find Carlson 
                         within that time frame and get her 
                         on board or there will be little 
                         chance of her finding a way back.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I understand.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         It's been a real pleasure. You have 
                         a much nicer smile than Ronald 
                         Coleman.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         The privilege was mine.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Goodbye Leopold, and thank you.
                              (she gives him a kiss)

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Oh, my.

                                     DR. KAU
                         Don't worry. We'll send Kate to you... 
                         as soon as possible. I'll see to it 
                         myself.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         See that you do.

                                     DR. KAU
                         You have my word on it.

               The doctors leave.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         Four minutes and counting.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well? I'll make this quick. Goodbye.

               He sticks out his hand.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Goodbye.
                              (impulsively Leopold 
                              embraces Charlie)
                         I shall miss you Charles, more than 
                         you know.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'll miss you too, Leopold... You're 
                         the only one who knows how to program 
                         the VCR... Take care of my sister.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will.

                                     CARLSON
                         You better. Take care of yourself 
                         too while you're at it... So long.

                                     KATE
                         I don't have any words for this.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I will see you soon.

                                     KATE
                         I know.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         You'll be with me all the time.

                                     KATE
                         I know. I brought you something.

               She takes out a ring and slips it on his finger.

                                     KATE
                         So you wouldn't forget me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Kate...

                                     KATE
                         So you wouldn't think this was all a 
                         dream.

               They kiss.

                                     KATE
                         Don't forget about me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I love you, Kate.

                                     KATE
                         Wait for me.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         For as long as it takes.

                                     KATE
                         I will come back to you! I will!

                                     LEOPOLD
                         I'll be waiting.

               They kiss again for the last time.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         It's time Leopold.

               Leopold holds Kate's face in his hands. Very slowly they 
               part.

               Leopold takes his place in the machine and straps himself 
               in. He places one hand on the red lever and the other against 
               the glass pane on the door. Kate comes over and places her 
               hand over his. Wordlessly, they say goodbye.

               After a moment, Dr. Kau gently moves Kate away. Dr. Plodder 
               silently raises his arm, signaling Leopold.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         9 8 7 6 5 4...

               Leopold shifts in his seat, his eyes never leaving Kate's, 
               his hand still against the glass.

               Kate smiles tenderly at Leopold.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         3 2 1!

               Dr. Plodder drops his arm signaling Leopold. Leopold pulls 
               the lever, still gazing at Kate. There is a blinding FLASH 
               of light, then darkness.

               INT. LAB - MONTHS LATER

               Kate raises her head. She sits at her desk surrounded by the 
               doctors.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         I cannot in good conscience let you 
                         go. It's out of the question.

                                     DR. DRAKE
                         I can't be a part of it either Kate. 
                         I'm sorry.

                                     DR. KAU
                         It's too big a risk.

               Kate rises and moves to the window. She is a full NINE MONTHS 
               PREGNANT.

                                     DR. PLODDER
                         We cannot guarantee your child's 
                         safety. It's that simple.

                                     KATE
                         He's waiting for me. I can feel it. 
                         Oh, Leopold...

               She gazes out the window, searching the horizon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A SMALL FARM HOUSE - EVENING

               Down from the horizon, a farm house. LEO COLES, 5 years old, 
               rocks on his front porch swing. Using his bare hands as 
               puppets he carries on a conversation. JULIA CARLSON pulls up 
               in her car.

                                     CARLSON
                         Hi. Does Katherine Coles live here?

                                     LEO
                         Yeah.
                              (yelling inside)
                         MOM??

                                     CARLSON
                         You're Leo aren't you? You don't 
                         remember me but I knew you when you 
                         were yea big.
                              (she holds her hands 
                              an inch apart)

                                     LEO
                         Yeah.

                                     CARLSON
                         I'm Julia. I'm an old friend of your 
                         mothers.

                                     LEO
                              (proudly)
                         We had spaghetti at our house 4 times 
                         this week.

               Kate comes out on the porch. She looks lovely.

                                     KATE
                         Leo you don't have to holler like 
                         that. I'm not deaf...

                                     CARLSON
                         Kate?

                                     KATE
                         ...Carlson?!

               The two women scream, run to each other and embrace.

                                     KATE
                         Carlson, I don't believe it. It's 
                         been... I don't know how many years. 
                         What are you doing here.

                                     CARLSON
                         I came to see you, sweetie.

                                     KATE
                         You remember my son, Leo?

                                     CARLSON
                         We've just been getting acquainted.

                                     KATE
                         Well, come inside. Come inside.

               INT. KATE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kate heads straight for the kitchen. Carlson scans the living 
               room before joining her.

               Although rustic on the outside, the inside of the house is 
               furnished with antiques and is Victorian in style.

                                     KATE
                              (covering her agitation)
                         Would you like some tea? I wish you 
                         had called before you come over. It 
                         would have given me a chance to 
                         straighten up the house... myself... 
                         my life. Tell me what you've been up 
                         to. Catch me up on everyone. I heard 
                         you received some big endowment or 
                         something. I was going to write, 
                         then call, but...

               She picks up the cup and saucer but it shakes so violently 
               she has to put it down.

                                     CARLSON
                         It's all right, Kate. I understand.

               There is a LONG PAUSE. Carlson gets the tea ready. Finally:

                                     CARLSON
                         You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a 
                         lot of time to get your affairs in 
                         order... And I warn you, it's nearly 
                         impossible for an intelligent woman 
                         back there.

               Kate stands by the back door, looking out at Leo.

                                     CARLSON
                         He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would 
                         be proud. We're aware of your 
                         situation but we felt when the time 
                         came, you deserved the option.

               Kate nods, trembling slightly.

               INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kate stands in the doorway as Carlson drives off.

                                     LEO
                         Who was that lady?

                                     KATE
                         Just an old friend.

                                     LEO
                         What she want?

                                     KATE
                              (she looks at Leo)
                         Nothing important. You brush your 
                         teeth?

               Leo shows off his teeth.

                                     KATE
                         Then give your old mom a hug and go 
                         to bed.
                              (Leo gives her a hug 
                              and a kiss)
                         Good night, cookie.

                                     LEO
                         Good night.

               Kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the 
               house turning off the lights. It is very guiet. All we hear 
               are Kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking.

               She makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room. She sits 
               down by the window at her desk. She sits a long time lost in 
               thought.

               She slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls 
               out an old photo album. She opens it and begins to look 
               through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE PHOTO ALBUM

               Inside, old black and white photographs, newspaper clippings, 
               magazine articles trace Leopold throughout his life.

               A photograph of Leopold looking as he did the night he 
               departed this world. He stands stiffly beside his family for 
               a formal portrait. Very discreetly, he points to a ring. It 
               is the same ring Kate gave him.

               A newspaper article shows Leopold donating $100,000 to 
               establish a scientific center researching studies in time 
               and space.

               A magazine picture shows Leopold, the sole male figure, 
               marching to give women the vote.

               A photograph of a large formal wedding. Leopold, around FIFTY, 
               stands alone in the wedding party, surreptitiously pointing 
               to his ring.

               A magazine article shows Leopold in his SIXTIES establishing 
               a scholarship program for studies in physics. He is surrounded 
               by academia and subtly points to his ring.

               A photograph of Leopold around SEVENTY shaking hands with 
               Albert Einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras.

               A professional photograph of Leopold at SEVENTY FIVE, sitting 
               regally in a chair. Beside him, an EMPTY chair. He rests one 
               hand on the back of the chair. The other he holds against 
               his chest, showing off the ring.

               An obituary with the headline, "Philanthropist, 80, dies in 
               bombings.

               A tear falls on the page.

               Kate cries silently, looking out the window. The camera 
               follows her gaze past her property...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BANQUET ROOM - YEARS LATER

               LEO, 24 and his BRIDE take to the floor for the first time 
               as husband and wife and are greeted with applause. Kate, 
               older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder.

               Charlie, standing with Patrice and their 6 blonde children, 
               approaches Kate and leads her to the dance floor.

                                     KATE
                         He's so YOUNG, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's old enough.

                                     KATE
                         Look at that idiotic expression on 
                         his face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's happy.

                                     KATE
                         Of course he's happy. All weddings 
                         are happy. It's the living together 
                         afterwards that causes all the 
                         trouble.

               Julia Carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet 
               hall. She stands at the back of the large room, searching.

               Couples fill the dance floor. Across the expansive room, 
               over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the 
               guests. Leo cuts in. As they spin, in the briefest of seconds, 
               Kate spots Carlson. She pales. They TURN.

               Kate peers over Leo's shoulder. Her eyes lock with Julia's. 
               Julia nods with purpose. Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not 
               wanting to let go. She buries her head in his chest.

                                     KATE
                         Oh, you're so young... I love you, 
                         Leo. Always remember that...

               From behind, her shoulders shake as she cries.

                                     LEO
                         Mom, we're only moving to Denver.

                                     KATE
                         I know, cookie. I know.

               INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT

               From behind a glass partition, Carlson works at her console. 
               A monitor counts away the seconds. 59, 58, 57... In the 
               darkened lab, Kate, dressed in early 1920s attire, straps 
               herself in and smiles tearfully. Their voices echo in the 
               lab.

                                     KATE
                         Well...

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know. Me too.

               They embrace each other for the last time.

                                     KATE
                         What will I do without you, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (softly)
                         Live happily ever after.

                                     CARLSON
                              (pushing the intercom 
                              button)
                         Kate, it's time.

                                     LEO
                              (emotionally)
                         Here. It's a letter for my father. 
                         Tell him about me and... um, tell 
                         him I love him. I want him to know 
                         me.

                                     KATE
                         Leo...

                                     LEO
                         Mom, I want you to go.

                                     KATE
                         But...

               He puts his finger to her lips. He looks to his wife then 
               back at Kate. He nods his head.

                                     LEO
                         Go.

               They force themselves to smile, trying to get through the 
               moment.

                                     CARLSON
                         Ready!

               Charlie, Leo and his new bride stand back. Inside the craft, 
               the only light comes from the glowing red lever. Carlson 
               raises her arm, signaling Kate. Then to her staff:

                                     CARLSON
                         9, 8, 7...

               Kate presses her hand against the glass as a final goodbye. 
               She grabs the lever with her other hand and turns away, 
               staring straight ahead. Charlie puts his arm around Leo.

                                     CARLSON
                         3, 2, 1!

               There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Kate is gone. The others stand 
               there motionless, stunned.

               The screen is BLACK.

               EXT. A LARGE VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1924 - NIGHT

               A FLASH of light illuminates the forest at the Albany estate. 
               A BEAT. Kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn, 
               stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansion's entrance.

               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

               Huge double doors open to reveal -- AN ORNATE BALLROOM. The 
               creme de la creme have gathered and dance. Kate overwhelmed, 
               rushes down an elaborate staircase. Half way down she looses 
               a shoe. She hesitates briefly then continues to the dance 
               floor.

               In the center of the floor, Leopold, looking very 
               distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young 
               woman. Try as she might, Leopold keeps her at a distance.

                                     FLIRT
                              (brushing his shirt 
                              front)
                         I just love a starched white shirt. 
                         It's so elegant.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Thank you.

                                     FLIRT
                         Skeeky.

                                     LEOPOLD
                         Yes. You dance like an angel Miss 
                         Beall. You light up the room around 
                         you. I thank you.

                                     FLIRT
                              (with a big smile)
                         Thank YOU.

               The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a 
               sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the 
               staircase.

               The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every 
               turn as Kate searches each male face.

               In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up 
               the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up 
               the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff, 
               flouncing down the stairs.

               Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks 
               for Leopold.

               Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs. 
               He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns 
               around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes.

               The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT.

               Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then 
               STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold 
               stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at 
               her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her 
               his hand.

               The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their 
               eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT 
               AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her 
               shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone. 
               They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment 
               of youth, when they fell in love.

               Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He 
               rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands 
               are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he 
               wraps his arms tightly around her.

               MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes 
               a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count 
               silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.

               THEY DANCE...

               An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest.

                                     LORD WHITEHEAD
                         Who is that dancing with Leopold?

                                     LADY WHITEHEAD
                         I've never seen her before.

               Kate and Leopold dance past. They are older. As they gaze 
               into each other's eyes, they twirl. THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS.

               At the center of the floor they stop dancing. THEY KISS. The 
               rest of the world dances around them.

               Over this background... THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO 
               SCREEN.

               The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate 
               and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly 
               point to their rings.

               Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for 
               studies in physics.

               The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to 
               include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera.

               The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It 
               shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching 
               chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly 
               into the camera, they show off their rings.

               SLOWLY the scrapbook closes...

               Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost 
               in the crowd. The clock CHIMES. Slowly we...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT

    FADE UP ON:
1                                                                  1

    The humming stillness of an American suburb on a summer's
    day: nannies push strollers, joggers jog, mailmen deliver,
    dogs are walked, kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways.

    On a quiet, tree-lined street we pick up two young athletic-
    looking boys riding bikes. LASER ALLGOOD (15) and his
    friend, CLAY (15).

    Like bats out of hell they pass block after block of
    charming, evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and
    drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house.

    They walk inside.   We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another
    room.

    INT. CLAY'S, BATHROOM - LATER
3                                                                  3

    Clay pounds on blue pills with a hammer, reducing them to
    powder. Laser watches.
                        LASER
              I don't know, dude.

    Clay cuts the powder into lines with a school ID card.
                        CLAY
              B minus in geometry, yo!   This
              shits the bomb!

    Clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort.   Then hands
    the rolled up bill to Laser.

                        CLAY (CONT'D)
              Add it up, son.
    Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line.


    INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY

    Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning
    against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD (18). It's her room.
    She pours over a game of Scrabble.

    Sitting next to Joni is her best girl friend, SASHA, (18).
    Sasha's checking out Joni's FACEBOOK PAGE.
                                                             2.

    Joni's best guy friend, JAI (18) sits across from her,
    calculating his next Scrabble move.

                        SASHA
              Oh my God, Joni, there are so many
              hotties in your class. You are so
              gonna hook up the first week.

                        JAI
              Just cause you're a 24 hour drive-
              thru doesn't mean everyone else has
              to be...

                        SASHA
              Hey, she worked her ass off! She
              deserves some hot jock sausage!
    Jai looks repulsed, and hurt.

                         SASHA (CONT'D)
                  (flip)
              Whatever. Why don't you guys just
              do it and get it over with?

    Joni and Jai blush. They're both too scared to admit their
    crush on each other.
                        SASHA (CONT'D)
              What? I'm just asking.

                        JAI
              Uh, maybe because we're friends...

                        SASHA
              Oh, really...?
    Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur.


    INT. CLAY'S HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER
5                                                                 5
    Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches
    a baseball game on TV. They bump into the couch. Clay's dad
    looks back, menacing.

                        CLAY'S FATHER
              Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch.

    The boys keep wrestling, wired from the pills. Again, they
    knock into the couch. Clay's dad spins around, pissed.
                        CLAY'S FATHER (CONT'D)
              What did I just say?!
                                                              3.

     The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the
     couch. He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face
     into his big fat sweaty armpit. Both Dad and Clay enjoy the
     brutal play. Clay laughs manically.

                             CLAY
                Let me go!

                          CLAY'S FATHER
                Don't do the crime if you can't do
                the time.
                          CLAY
                Dad, your pits smell like burnt
                ass! Get off me!
     As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son,
     we note a trace of longing on his face.

     Joni, Laser and JULES ALLGOOD (40's) fair-skinned,
     attractive, sit before well prepared dinner. Still buzzing,
     Laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table.
                           JONI
                Laser!   Knock it off!

                           LASER
                What?!   I'm not doing anything.

     NIC ALLGOOD (late 40's) pulls up into the driveway beside a
     beat up white TRUCK covered in AA slogan bumper stickers.

     Nic enters.   Drops her bag and heads for the table.

                           NIC
                Hi guys.   Sorry I'm late.
                                               4.

                    JULES
          Don't worry. We just started.

                    NIC
          27 fibroids. All in the lining.

She kisses Jules.

                    JULES
          Honey, that's disgusting.   We're
          eating.
                    JONI
          Did you do that laparoscopically?

                    NIC
          That's right, Smart Girl.   And we
          got `em all.

As Nic settles in...
                    NIC (CONT'D)
          Hey, whose truck is that?

                       JULES
          Mine.
                       NIC
          Yours?

                    JULES
          For the business.

                    NIC
          What business?..
              (getting edgy)
          The gardening?

                    JONI
              (protective)
          Isn't it landscaping.
                    JULES
          Yes, thank you very much.

                     NIC
              (strained)
          Okay...
              (then)
          Do we have any Cabarnet left?
                    JULES
          I didn't look, honey.
                                                             5.

Nic gets up and goes to the kitchen for wine.   Laser's cell
phone RINGS. He answers it.

                    LASER
          Hey, what's up?

Jules puts her hand on Laser's arm.

                    JULES
          Laser, no phone calls at the table.

                    LASER
              (into phone)
          Lemme hit you back.

Laser hangs up.   Nic re-enters with a large glass of red.
                    NIC
              (sitting down)
          Who was that?
                      LASER
          Nobody.    Clay.

Jules and Nic share a look. Jules starts making maternal
windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on Laser's arm.
                    JULES
          Can I ask you something?
          What do you get from your
          relationship with Clay?
                    LASER
          What do you mean, "get"?

Laser looks down at Jules' thumb on his arm.
                    JULES
          Do you feel like he's the kind of
          person who will help you grow?
                    LASER
          Mom, you're windshield wiping me.

                    NIC
          Hey, did you start on those thank-
          you notes for your birthday gifts?

                     JONI
          Not yet.   But I will...
                                                                 6.

                         NIC
               I just think it's easier to knock
               them out when it's fresh.
                         JONI
               Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight.

                         NIC
               Great...I mean, you don't want to
               have to start with an apology. You
               know? Then it's embarrassing.
                         JULES
               Okay, honey. She got it. Let it
               go.
                          NIC
               Okay, I'll let it go...
                   (then)
               I mean, if it was up to you, our
               kids wouldn't even write thank-you
               notes, they'd just send out good
               vibes.

     Nic takes another swig of vino and smiles at Joni through
     increasingly plum-stained teeth.
                         NIC (CONT'D)
               I can't believe my baby's 18.

                            JULES
               I know...

                         NIC
                   (devolving into baby talk)
               Big girl. You're a big girl...
                            JONI
               Mom...

     Joni mimes wiping her teeth.   Embarrassed, Nic starts licking
     at her stained teeth.

     As Joni cranks out thank-you notes, Laser enters.

                            JONI
               What?
     Laser looks nervous.
                                                                7.

                         LASER
               Have you thought any more about,
               you know, making that call...?
                          JONI
               Yeah.   I don't want to.

                         LASER
               Okay...I was just wondering if you
               changed your mind.

                            JONI
               I haven't.

     He starts to leave, but her answer bugs him.    He turns back.
                         LASER
               How can you not even be curious?

                          JONI
               Sorry, Laser. I just don't want
               to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I
               don't want to deal with that right
               now.
                    (co-dependent leak)
               And also, that could really hurt
               moms' feelings...

                         LASER
               God, why do you worry about them so
               much? They don't even have to know
               about it!

                         JONI
               Look, you can do it when you turn
               18, okay?
                         LASER
               I never ask you for anything.

     Laser walks out of the room.   Joni feels horrible.

     INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

     Nic and Jules lay in bed watching TV, unwinding from the day.
                         NIC
               I just don't understand why you
               bought the truck now.
                                                             8.

                    JULES
          Because if I'm starting this
          business I need something to haul
          my equipment in.

                    NIC
          Okay. It just seems a little
          cart before the horse.
                    JULES
          What does that mean?
                    NIC
          Sweetie, you don't even have any
          clients yet.
                    JULES
          Well you're the one who's always
          telling me to "act as if!"

                    NIC
              (back peddling)
          That's true. I do. You're right.

The women settle back.   Nic sees Jules feels bad.
                    NIC (CONT'D)
          Look, I'm sorry. It's good you
          bought the truck. Its proactive.

Nic caresses Jules' arm, wanting to make it better.
                      NIC (CONT'D)
          Hey...

Jules doesn't look at Nic.   She keeps her eyes on the T.V.

          Wanna watch a movie?

Jules perks up.    Nic immediately regrets her suggestion.
                    JULES
          A movie-movie?

                   NIC
          Yeah. We haven't done that in a
          while.

MINUTES LATER -- NIC AND JULES
are cozied up side-by-side facing the TV.
                                                                9.

     ANGLE ON - THE TV

     The volume is turned low on TWO NAKED MEN lying on a chaise
     longue. One guy fellating the other.

     Joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the
     mom's bedroom. She heads for the desk and stealthy opens a
     drawer. She rummages though with clear intention.
     She pulls out a FOLDER and studies the cover. We see the
     words: "Pacific Cryo Clinic: Bringing your dreams to life."

     ANGLE ON - THE BED

     We now only see Nic. Jules has slipped under the blanket,
     and is now between Nic's legs. We see Nic trying to get into
     it, but having a hard time.

                         NIC
               I don't like the guys in this one.
               They're too shaved.

                         JULES
               Don't focus on it.
                         NIC
               How about the one with the biker
               gang?

                         JULES
               We left it in Hawaii.

     Jules wrestles with the blankets.    Wants them out of her way.

                         NIC
                   (pulling them back up)
               I'm cold, honey.

                            JULES
               Sorry.     I couldn't breathe.
     Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner.
     The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top
     sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME
     CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full
     volume.
                                                               10.

               Shit!!     Where's the remote?!

                         MAN IN MOVIE
               I'm gonna fuck that tight ass!...
     Jules and Nic both dive for the remote. It's lost under the
     mass of bedding. They struggle to find it as the grunting
     and 70's disco music blares.

     Joni turns to the wall, confused.    She hears the porno music
     pulsing though.

     Nic finally recovers the remote and hits mute.

                         NIC
               Jesus Christ!
     Nic flops back, traumatized.

                         NIC (CONT'D)
               The whole neighborhood heard that!
                         JULES
               No, they didn't.

                         NIC
               Well, that was a vibe kill.

     Jules looks defeated.

     Joni turns back to the file on the desk. She flips though
     some pages of documents and stops. CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4
     YEAR-OLD BOY standing in a sandbox looking straight into a
     camera with a big, open grin.

     We see that boy, 35 years later, carrying a box of tomatoes
     and putting them in the back of a truck. This is PAUL, Joni
     and Laser's biological father.

     Paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. He approaches
     TANYA, (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess.
                         PAUL
               How you doing, foxy?

                         TANYA
               Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe.

                         PAUL
               Oh, sorry...
                         TANYA
               No, I like it. It's earthy.

                         PAUL
               What can I say. I've just been out
               there, you know...hoe-ing.
                   (looking at the seating
                    chart)
               How's it looking tonight?
     They stand close to each other, peering at the chart.

                         TANYA
               Gonna be tight.
                           PAUL
               Really...

     Paul's cell rings. He gives Tanya a hand squeeze and heads
     for the kitchen, answering.
                           PAUL (CONT'D)
               Hello.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
               Hi, is this Paul Hatfield?

                          PAUL
               It is.   Who's this?
                                                              12.

                         WOMAN'S VOICE
               My name is Wendy Minter. I'm
               calling from The Pacific Cryobank.
                          PAUL
               Okay.   What can I do for you?

                         WENDY
               I just need to confirm that you
               donated sperm with us between 1991
               and 1993.
     At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale.

                         PAUL
               Yeah...I did a little bit of that
               back then...

     Paul enters. The kitchen is humming with COOKS prepping for
     the dinner rush. He looks around for a quiet spot.

                         WENDY
               As you know the Cryobank has a
               confidentiality policy which
               prohibits us from releasing your
               identity without your consent.

     A cook, MARGO, approaches Paul to speak with him.   Paul nods:
     "Can't talk." Hands her the box of tomatoes.

                          PAUL
               Uh-huh.
     Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy.

     Paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner.

                         WENDY (O.S.)
               Well we've been contacted by a
               young woman conceived using your
               semen, and she's asked if you'd be
               open to having contact with her.

     Paul's speechless.

     Paul gets dressed while Tanya lays on her messy bed.
                         TANYA
               You must of figured you'd get a
               call at some point.

                         PAUL
               Not really. I mean I was 19 when I
               did it. It was so long ago...I
               just figured no one actually used
               my stuff.

     Tanya moves closer to him, flirty.
                            TANYA
               Why?     I'd use it.

                         PAUL
                   (ignoring the innuendo)
               This is so weird. I mean, a part
               of me's really curious...

                         TANYA
               So what are you gonna do?
                         PAUL
               I don't know.

     Joni and Jules play scrabble at the table. Joni's cell
     rings. She grabs it off the counter and answers.

     Paul anxiously paces his overgrown back-yard on his cell
     phone. He picks weeds as he talks. Conversation intercut.
                                                            14.

          Hi, I'm looking for Joni Allgood.

                    JONI
          This is she...

                    PAUL
          Hi.  This is Paul...
              (clearing his throat)
          Uh, your donor...?

                        JONI
          Oh!   Hi...

Joni shoots up out of her chair and starts leaving the room
to get some privacy away from her mom.
                    PAUL
          Is this a good time to talk?

                    JONI
              (flustered)
          Yeah...

                    JULES
          Where are you going?     It's your
          turn.

Joni doesn't answer.     She just walks out to her backyard.

                    PAUL
          So...
              (doesn't know what to say)
          How are you?

                        JONI
          I'm good.      How are you?

                    PAUL
          I'm well, thanks.
Banal, awkward pause.     Paul jumps in to fill the void.

                    PAUL (CONT'D)
          So, Wendy at the Cryobank said you
          call--
Joni cuts in, nervous and businesslike.
                                                                15.

                          JONI
                Actually, my brother   asked if I'd
                call you because I'm   18 and he's
                only 15 which is too   young to call--
                anyway, he'd like to   meet you...if
                you want to...

                          PAUL
                    (thrown)
                Your brother?

                          JONI
                Yeah. Well, technically my half-
                brother. Each of my moms had a
                kid, you know, with your sperm...
                           PAUL
                No.   I didn't know.

                             JONI
                Oh.
                          PAUL
                Both of them?

                             JONI
                Yeah.

                          PAUL
                Like in two?
                           JONI
                Uh huh.   Like in gay.

                             PAUL
                Good deal.     I love lesbians.
     Paul cringes at his lameness.     Joni doesn't know what to say.

     Joni and Laser get out of the car and head to the restaurant
     to meet Paul. They're both clearly nervous.

                          JONI
                I just don't want you to have big
                expectations.

               Will you quit saying that?    I don't
               have any expectations.
                         JONI
               Okay. I'm just saying he
               might be weird. I mean, he donated
               sperm...
                         LASER
               Well if he hadn't done it, you

     Paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance.   He nervously
     checks the door as customers enter.

     MINUTES LATER-
     Joni and Laser enter the restaurant.   They look nervous too.

     ANGLE ON PAUL

     He studies them for a beat, sees them looking around.
     Figures they must be "his kids." They look in his direction,
     spot him. He raises his hand, stands. They walk over.

     The moment is rife.    Paul holds out his hand to Joni.
                           PAUL
               Joni.    Hey. Nice to meet you.

                         JONI
               Nice to meet you too.
     Paul holds out a hand to Laser.

               And Laser, right?
                            LASER
               Right.

               Cool, I got a table set up for us

                         PAUL
               Listen, feel free and ask me
               anything you want, okay?
                   (off their stares)
               Or we can just hang out. That's
               fine too. Whatever you guys want.

                            LASER/JONI
               Okay.
     Paul presses on, trying to break the ice.

                         PAUL
               Anything you want to ask me, Laser?
                         LASER
               I...uh...I didn't really have any
               specific questions...
                         PAUL
                   (helping him out)
               That's fine. I'd love to know
               about you guys. What about you,
               Joni? What are you up to?
                         JONI
               Uh, well, I just graduated high
               school. I'm starting college in
               the fall.
                            PAUL
               Oh yeah?     Congratulations.
                                                18.

          Joni's the brains in the family.
          She won a National Merit
          Scholarship.

                    PAUL
          Shut the front door!

                    LASER
          Yeah. And she got like an 800 on
          her Verbal SAT.
                    JONI
          Okay, Laser...

                    LASER
          What? I'm just saying you're
          really smart.

                    JONI
          No, I just work harder than you.
                    PAUL
          Don't stress it, Laze. School
          wasn't my thing either and I turned
          out okay.
                    LASER
              (re: his name)
          Laser.
                     PAUL
          I'm sorry. Laser.
              (beat)
          So tell me about you, Laser. What
          are you into?
Laser freezes.   So his sister jumps in.

                    JONI
          Laser's an amazing athlete.
                     PAUL
          Oh yeah?

                    LASER
          Did you play any sports in school?

                    PAUL
          I played a little basketball in
          junior high.
                                                        19.

                       LASER
          That's it?

                    PAUL
          Pretty much. The whole "team"
          thing got on my nerves, you know
          like, "Hey, let's go kick some ass,
          man!" What about you?
                    LASER
          I play some Soccer. Basketball.
          Baseball. You know, team sports.

Paul realizes he's put his foot in his mouth.

                    PAUL
          Hey, I wasn't bagging teams in
          general. Teams are great. I'm
          just weird like that.

                    LASER
          Yeah, I like teams.

We can tell Laser is growing frustrated at his inability to
connect with Paul. Joni jumps in.
                    JONI
          So this is your place?

                    PAUL
          Yeah, I've been working on it for a
          while. I also have this organic co-
          op farm down the road. We use a
          lot of the stuff we grow there for
          the restaurant.
                    JONI
              (excited)
          That's so cool.      I'm totally into
          local.
                    LASER
              (busting her)
          You are?

                    JONI
          Uh, yeah Laser! I've been like
          trying to get moms to buy local for
          forever.

Laser tries again to reconnect.
                                                               20.

                         LASER
               So, like, do you raise pigs and
               stuff?
                          PAUL
               No.  No pigs...
                   (beat)
               But it's a great spot. You guys
               should come check it out sometime.

                         JONI
               Yeah...Definitely...

     Excited, Joni turns to Laser.    He seems uninterested.

     The kids and Paul exit the restaurant. Paul walks to a
     classic BMW motorcycle. Lasers tries to hide his awe.
                         LASER
               Is that yours?

                           PAUL
               Yeah.    You like motorcycles?
                         LASER
               Yeah, but...our moms are kind of
               anti-motorcycle.
                         JONI
               And by "kind of" he means they'd
               kill us if we ever rode one.

                         PAUL
               That's too bad.   They're fun.

     Time to say goodbye. Again, no one knows the protocol here.
     After an awkward beat, Paul holds out his arms for hugs.
                         PAUL (CONT'D)
               Well it was great to meet you guys.

     He and Joni hug.
                         PAUL (CONT'D)
               I hope this was okay.

                         JONI
               Yeah...totally...thank you.

     Now Paul and Laser share a somewhat awkward man-hug.
                                                            21.

                         PAUL
               Really nice to meet you, Laser.

                            LASER
               Yeah.

     Joni gives a quick wave to Paul. She turns to go and Laser
     follows. Paul watches them walk away. He looks stirred up
     by the meeting.

     Joni and Laser head back home.

                         JONI
               I just never pictured him that way.
               I just...I don't know...He was so
               cool and interesting. I can't
               believe that was him...He was so
               nice, you know?...

               Yeah...
                         JONI
               God, Laser! You're the one that
               wanted to meet him so bad!

                            LASER
               I know.

                         JONI
               Well what did you think of him?
                         LASER
               I don't know. He seemed kind of
               into himself.

     Nic and Jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch
     watching cable. They see Laser on his way out of the house.

                         JULES
               Hey bug, come here. We're watching
               "Locked Up Abroad: Uganda."
                           LASER
               I saw it.    It was gnarly.
                         NIC
               Where are you going?

                           LASER
               Clay's.

     Jules and Nic shoot each other a concerned look.

                         NIC
               Don't be back late, okay?

                           LASER
               I know.
                         JULES
               Can I have a hug before you go?

               Hug her.    That's what she's there
               for.

     Laser leaves.   Nic hits mute on the TV, looks at Jules.
                         NIC
               Ugh. Maybe we should just sit him
               down and ask him already.

                           JULES
               What?    "Are you and Clay fucking?"

                         NIC
               "Exploring" is the word I'd use...
                                                23.

                    JULES
          And what if he is "exploring?"
          This is the age for that. Why
          should we care?

                     NIC
          We shouldn't...
              (then)
          I just don't understand why he's
          exploring with that loser.

                    JULES
          Look, we don't even know what the
          deal is. We're jumping to
          conclusions.
                    NIC
          I feel like he has so much
          potential and he's just wasting it.

Nic's comment hits a nerve in Jules.
                    JULES
          What are you trying to say?

                    NIC
          What do you mean, what am I trying
          to say?

                    JULES
          It feels like there's some subtext
          here.

                    NIC
          What are you talking about?
                    JULES
          I don't know: Like mother like son?
          Is that it? Both of us aimless,
          wandering in the darkness, "wasting
          our potential?"
Nic won't go there.

                    NIC
          Okay, honey, you're on a whole
          other tangent and I have no idea
          what you're talking about.

                    JULES
          Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the
          plane of consciousness for you yet.
                                                             24.

                          PAUL
                Sweet. They were really good kids.
                The boy's kind of a sensitive jock
                and the girl's kind of innocent but
                whip-smart and super cute.

                          TANYA
                Sounds like you connected.
                          PAUL
                Yeah, we kinda did.

                          TANYA

                          PAUL
                We didn't really leave it anywhere.
     Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a
     basket of freshly-picked fruits.

                            BROOKE
                Hey Paul.
     Paul leans over the basket.

                          PAUL
                Whatcha got? Oh cool. First
                strawberries of the season.

                          BROOKE
                Don't they look awesome? I thought
                you should have the first taste.
     And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves.

                 "I thought you should have the
                 first taste...of my pussy."

     Clay rummages through the top drawer of Jules' dresser.
     Laser stands behind him, uncomfortable.

     grabs one of the DVDs and spins back around.

     Jules pulls her truck into the driveway, almost running over
     Laser's bike.

     INT. LASER'S ROOM - DAY

     Laser and Clay are still watching the porn...as Jules walks
     in the room.
                         JULES
               Laser, you left your bike out...

     Laser reflexively grabs for the remote. As he fumbles for
     it, Jules sees what they're watching. She looks mortified.

     INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING
41                                                             41

     We enter a family conference already in progress.
     Nic and Jules act calm but are inwardly mortified that their
     15-year-old son found their porn.

                         NIC
               Laser, your mom and I accept you
               and love you unconditionally? You
               know that, right?

                            LASER
               Yeah.

                         NIC
               And you know you can be open with
               us about anything.
                                                             27.

                    LASER
          Yeah, I know.

Jules steels herself for a frank discussion.

                    JULES
          Laser, is there anything you want
          to talk about?
                       LASER
          Like what?
                       NIC
          Anything.     Anything on your mind.

Laser cracks his knuckles.
                    LASER
          Well there is something.

Nic and Jules share a look.      "Here we go."
                    LASER (CONT'D)
          It's more of a question, really.

                    NIC
          That's okay.

                    JULES
          We won't judge you.
Laser looks at his moms.       Nic and Jules brace themselves.

                    LASER
          Why do you guys watch gay man-porn?
Nic and Jules look at each other, thrown.

                    NIC
          Well, first I have to say we rarely
          watch that movie--
Jules touches Nic's arm.

                       JULES
          Honey...
                    NIC
          And secondly, I really don't
          appreciate you snooping around our
          room. Was that Clay's idea? I
          have to say again, I don't like
          him. He seems untended...!
                                                28.

                    JULES
          Honey, that's not what he asked--

                     NIC
              (snapping)
          Fine. Do you want to answer his
          question?!

                     JULES
          Well, sweetie, human sexuality is
          complicated. And sometimes,
          people's desires can be...counter-
          intuitive...
              (soldiering on)
          For instance, since women's sexual
          responsiveness is mostly internal,
          sometimes it's exciting for us to
          see sexual responsiveness more, you
          know...
              (beat)
          ...externalized.
Laser looks at them, still baffled.

                    JULES (CONT'D)
          Like with a penis.
                    LASER
          But like, wouldn't you rather watch
          two women doing it?
                    JULES
          You would think that. But in most
          of those movies, they've hired two
          straight women to pretend and the
          inauthenticity is just unbeara--
                    NIC
          Okay, that's enough! Laser, your
          mom and I have a sense there's some
          other stuff going on in your life
          and we just want to be let in.

                    LASER
          What do you mean?
                    JULES
          Are you having a relationship with
          someone?

                    NIC
          You could tell us, honey. We'd
          understand and support you.
                                                                 29.

     Laser looks confused.   How did they find out about Paul?

                         LASER
               I just met him once.

     Nic and Jules share a worried look.

                         NIC
               What do you mean once?

                         JULES
               Did he find you on-line?!

                           LASER
               What?!
                         NIC
               Who did you meet once?

                           LASER
               Paul!    I met him with Joni.
                         NIC
               Who's Paul?!

                         JULES
               Why was Joni there?!

                         LASER
               She set it up.
                         NIC
               Forget the set-up!   Who is Paul?!!

                         LASER
               Our sperm donor.
     Jules and Nic go white.

                         LASER (CONT'D)
               Wait, did you guys think I was
               gay?!

     Joni has been pulled into the family conference. Nic and
     Jules are trying to remain as calm as possible. Nic slugs a
     gulp of wine.
                                                           30.

                          JULES
                Look, guys, we understand why you'd
                be curious about your biological
                father. That's totally natural.

                          NIC
                But why didn't you tell us?

                          JONI
                Because we knew you'd be upset.

                          NIC
                WE'RE NOT UPSET!!

     Jules calms her riled-up partner.
                          JULES
                Honey...
                    (to Joni; expressing her
                     upset more calmly)
                We just wish you'd have included us
                in your thinking. But what's done
                is done. You met him, and now you
                guys can move on--

                           JONI
                    (sheepish)
                Actually...
                    (beat)
                I want to see him again.
                 JULES                             LASER
     You do?!                         You do?!

                          JONI (CONT'D)
                    (to Laser)
                Yeah. I was gonna tell you.

                          NIC
                Whoa! Whoa! No. No way.
                    (regaining dominance)
                Nobody is seeing anyone until we
                meet him!

     Joni looks at Laser.   They knew this would happen.

     INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Nic and Jules do a post-mortem as they floss.
                                                             31.

                         NIC
               Yeah, I get it. He's their
               biological father and all that crap
               but it still feels really shitty.
               Like we're not enough or something,
               you know?

                         JULES
               Of course I know. I don't want to
               time-share our kids with someone.
               Especially when it's Joni's last
               summer home. No way.

     When Jules leaves the room Nic pulls a clump of long, wet red
     hair out of the sink.
                         NIC
               Jesus, Jules! The plumber was just
               here!

     Nic throws the clump of hair in the trash.

     INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

                         NIC
                   (getting tactical)
               Look, we need to be smart about
               this. If we act like grubby
               bitches, we're just gonna make it
               worse.
                           JULES
               I know...

                         NIC
               Let's just kill him with kindness
               and put it to bed.

                          JULES
               I'm with you, honey.
                   (then)
               We're gonna get through this, okay?

     Nic smiles.   She loves when Jules shows confidence.
                         NIC
               I love you, chicken.

     The women bump fists.   They have a plan.
                         JULES
               I love you too, pony.
                                                                32.

     Paul rides slowly down the street, checking addresses. He
     pulls over and cuts his engine in front of the Allgood house.

     Paul rings the bell. Waits. The door opens and Nic and
     Jules are there smiling with "kill him with kindness" faces.

                        NIC
               Paul! It is so great to meet you.
               I'm Nic. This is Jules.

     Paul shakes their hands.

                         PAUL
               Hi, great to meet you two.

                         JULES
               I hope the traffic wasn't too bad.
                         PAUL
               No, I've got my bike so...I just
               sort of weave through.

     Nic clocks the motorcycle, stifles the impulse to judge.
                          NIC
               Great.   Well, come on in.

     As they enter, Paul holds out a bottle of wine.
                         PAUL
               This is for you. I don't know if
               you guys like wine...
     Nic takes it.

                         NIC
               Are you kidding? We love it.
                   (checking the label)
               And a Petit Syrah. What a treat!
               Let me get some glasses.

     Nic leaves Paul by the stairs with Jules. Little silence.
     Jules steals a look at him, unable to contain her curiosity.
                                                             33.

                         PAUL
               Beautiful house.    How long you guys
               lived here?
                         JULES
               Almost ten years. Wait, has it
               been that long?
                   (rambling nervously)
               We moved right after Laser broke
               his leg, I remember that because we
               had a ramp for a while, so that
               would have been...ten, no, nine?
               No, ten years this fall.

     Paul nods, smiling at her nervousness.
                           PAUL
               Okay.

     Laser and Joni enter. Joni lights up when she sees Paul.
     Jules watches Paul hug her. Uncomfortable, she heads for
     THE KITCHEN --

     Jules finds Nic's pouring herself a sizable glass of wine.
                           JULES
               You okay?

                         NIC
                   (not okay)
               Yeah. Fine.

     Jules feels her inner co-dependent swelling in her chest.

                         JULES
               Go easy on the wine, hon.   It's day
               time.

                         NIC
               Okay. And same goes for the micro-
               managing...

     Everyone sits at the picnic table.

                         JULES
               I hope the food's okay. Joni told
               us you own a restaurant.
                                                        34.

                    PAUL
          The food's great. Can't go wrong
          with salmon and corn.
Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note.

                    NIC
          So Paul, did you always know you
          wanted to be in food-services
          industry?

Paul smiles at Nic, trying to disarm her.

                    PAUL
          Well, I always liked food.
                    NIC
          No, I was asking because I remember
          reading in your file, back when we
          were looking for, you know, sperm,
          anyway, you said you were studying
          international relations.

                    PAUL
          Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time
          ago. Yeah, I was considering it,
          but then I dropped out of school.

                    JONI
          You dropped out of college?
                    PAUL
          Yeah, it wasn't my thing.

                      NIC
                (squinching)
          No?    Why's that?

                    PAUL
          It just seemed like a massive waste
          of money after a while. I mean, I
          wasn't "doing" anything. I was
          just sitting on my ass listening to
          people spout off ideas I could've
          just as easily learned reading a
          book.
Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms.

                    PAUL (CONT'D)
          I'm not saying higher learning
          uniformly sucks. I mean, college
          is great for some people.

                                                35.
                     PAUL (CONT'D)
          Joni, I'm sure you're gonna love
          it. That's just me. I'm just
          weird that way.
              (beat)
          Which is probably why I ended up in
          the food-services industry.

                    LASER
          See what he did there, mom? You
          said "food-services industry," then
          he said "food-services industry..."
                    NIC
          Yeah, I got it, Laser. Thanks.
              (apropos of nothing)
          So, Paul, what about your social
          life?

                    PAUL
          My social life?
                    NIC
          You know, are you married,
          divorced, seeing anyone?

                     JONI
          Mom!

                     NIC
          What?   We're getting to know Paul.
                    PAUL
          No, never been married or divorced.
          I date a little, but I'm just kind
          of focused on my work right now.
                     NIC
          Oh.

Paul wants a break from the heat.
                    PAUL
          So, how'd you guys meet?

Jules smiles, embarrassed.   Nic jumps in.
                     NIC
          We met at UCLA. I was a resident
          in the ER and Jules had an
          emergency.
                    JULES
          My tongue went numb.
                                                         36.

                       PAUL
           Really?

THUD!   We turn to see Laser, pounding his head on the table.

                     JULES
           Laser, that's not nice.

                     LASER
           What's not nice is subjecting your
           kids to the same story 1000 times!
                     PAUL
               (ignoring Laser)
           What happened to your tongue?
                     JULES
           I don't know. I just lost all the
           feeling in my face and tongue and I
           thought I might gag and then, you
           know...
                       PAUL
           Choke?    Die?...

                     JULES
           Yeah...exactly...

                     NIC
           Well it was pretty clear to me she
           was just having an anxiety attack
           and she'd be fine.

                     PAUL
           So what'd you do for her?
                     NIC
           Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get
           her to relax, talk, move her tongue
           around.
                     LASER
           Mom, that's gross!

                     JULES
               (ignoring Laser, to Nic)
           Actually, she started teasing me
           and that really helped.

                     NIC
           I was trying to distract you.
                                                         37.

                    JULES
          I know. And it worked. You were
          really funny.
                    NIC
          You were really pretty.

Nic reaches over and caresses Jules' hand.   Joni rolls her
eyes, embarrassed.

                    JULES
          So that's it. My tongue started
          working again.

                    NIC
          And we've been glued at the hip
          ever since.

                    PAUL
          That's a great story.
                    JULES
              (beaming)
          We like it.

Laser and Joni share a look.
                    PAUL
          So Nic, I know you're a doctor.
          How `bout you, Jules? What do you
          do?
Jules never likes this question.

                    JULES
          Well, I, you know, I studied
          architecture in college...

                     PAUL
          Right...
                    JULES
          But I'm not an architect. I mean I
          was on my way to becoming one. But
          I quit before the kids were born.
                    PAUL
          Well, that happens...

                    JULES
          When they got a little older, I
          started a Balinese furniture import
          business...
                                                         38.

                      PAUL
          Right on.

                     JULES
          Yeah.   But that didn't work out.

                    PAUL
          Well, business aren't easy--
                    JULES
          Actually, I'm in the process of
          starting a new business.

                    PAUL
          Good for you. What kind?
                    JULES
          Landscape design...
              (before he can respond)
          But not like a gardener! I mean,
          yes, there's a gardening component
          to it, but the real work is to
          create unique, eco-friendly outdoor
          spaces that harmonize with the
          surrounding environment. Do you
          know what I mean?
                    PAUL
          Absolutely.

In Nic's mind, Jules is drowning in verbiage.   So she jumps
in to save her.

                    NIC
          Hey Paul, did Joni tell you about
          her graduation speech?
                    PAUL
          No, she didn't.

                    NIC
          It was incredible. So full of
          wisdom and hope...
              (turning to her Joni)
          Hon, go get it. I'm sure he'd love
          to hear it...
                    JONI
              (blushing)
          No, mom, I'm sure he wouldn't...
                                                       39.

                    NIC
          Sure he would.   Come on.   Go get
          it...
                    JONI
              (getting upset)
          No, it's okay...

                    NIC
          Sweetie, don't be embarrassed.

                    JONI
          I'm not embarrassed!   Jesus!     Give
          it a rest already!

This outburst stuns Nic into silence. Her daughter has never
spoken to her like this. Laser stands up.

                    LASER
          I'll get the ice-cream.
                    JONI
              (standing up)
          I'll help you.

Joni and Laser leave the room. Nic pours herself the last of
Paul's Petit Syrah. Jules smiles, covering her anxiety.

                    JULES
              (softly)
          Honey, that's your forth glass.
                    NIC
          Actually, it's my third.    But
          thanks for counting.
Paul turns to Jules, trying to revive the mood.

                    PAUL
          Hey, I was just thinking. You
          know, I bought this place last year
          and the backyard's a wreck. Would
          you be interested in working on it?

                    JULES
              (insecure)
          Oh, that's okay.

                    PAUL
          No, seriously. I don't have time
          to work on it myself.
                                                                40.

                          JULES
                Thank you. That's really sweet.
                Why don't you think about it.
                           PAUL
                Why?  I just did.
                    (then)
                I mean, if you're not up for it
                that's okay--

                          JULES
                    (jumping on it)
                No! I am!
                    (getting excited)
                I'm up for it!...
     Jules smiles at Nic: "Isn't this great?   My first client."
     Nic looks less than pleased.

     Nic pushes a cart piled high with gardening supplies. Jules
     grabs a couple BAGS of fertilizer, throws them on top.

                          NIC
                ...I'm just saying, the plan was to
                limit his involvement--
                          JULES
                You're unbelievable. You're all
                over me about getting clients, I
                finally get one and you're--
                          NIC
                He's not just a client, Jules.
                                      ,
                He's our sperm donor! Have you
                ever heard the phrase "Don't Shit
                Where You Eat?"

                          JULES
                Yes, and I think it's disgusting.
     The two separate, go down separate isles.     When they rejoin,
     Nic is contrite.

                          NIC
                I'm sorry. He just seemed sort
                of...self-satisfied to me.
                                                                41.

     Jules grabs the olive branch.

                         JULES
               Yeah, he was working the whole
               "alternative" thing pretty hard.

                         NIC
                   (mimicking)
               "I just need to get outside and
               `do' things, not sit on my ass and
               learn. But that's just me. I'm
               weird that way."

     They both laugh.    Nic's funny sometimes.

     Jules drives slowly up the hill looking for Paul's address.
     She sees the house and pulls in the driveway next to an old
     truck and a motorcycle.

     Jules and Paul walk through Paul's backyard, evaluating.
                          JULES
               ...We could do a kind of a Secret
               Garden thing with trellises and
               topiary...
                   (clocking his face)
               ...or something more Asian,
               minimal, with a rock garden feel.
               It's up to you...
                         PAUL
               What do you think?

                         JULES
               Personally, I'm tired of minimal.
               I'm into more is more. Let's not
               try to tame the space. I think it
               would look great all lush and
               overgrown and fecund...
                           PAUL
               Fecund?

               I'm sorry, you know, fertile...
                                                             42.

                         PAUL
               No, I love that word. You just
               don't hear it that often.
                   (thinking)
               More is more. Yeah. Let's do that.

     Jules is staring at Paul.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
               What?

                         JULES
               Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids
               in your expressions...

     Jules looks more intensely at Paul's face.
                         JULES (CONT'D)
               You and Laser have the same mouth.

                         PAUL
               You think so?

                          JULES
               Yeah.
     The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind
     of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected.

     Jules and Laser play Ping-Pong as Nic gets home with Chinese
     take-out for the family dinner.

                         JULES
               Pretty close.
     Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules.

                         LASER
               20-3...match point.
                         NIC
               So how'd it go today?

                          JULES
               Great.   We settled on a concept.

                         NIC
               What is it?

                         JULES
               It's hard to explain. You have to
               kind of see the space to get it.

                          NIC
                   (to Laser)
               Laser, did you write Pup-pup a Get
               Well card?
                   (off his silence)
               Laser! What do I have to do?! I
               bought you a card. I left it on
               your desk. All you had to do was--
                         LASER
               Mom, settle! I will...

                         NIC
               Don't tell me to settle, mister.

               to the Dodger game Saturday.

                         LASER
               Whatever, I have other plans
               anyway.

                         NIC
               What other plans?
                   (off his silence)
               I'm asking you a quest--

                         LASER
               I said I'd do something with Paul!
     Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He
     tosses the racquet on the table and leaves. Nic yells:

                         NIC
               You used to be so cute!

54                                                               54
     We cut onto Paul and Laser, looking out at something.   Laser
     is holding a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA.

                         PAUL
               This may not be a good idea.
                                                              44.

                         CLAY (O.S.)
               Are you filming?!

     We cut to Clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall.
     He's preparing to ride the ledge, jump a dumpster and land
     his board on the ground.

                         PAUL
                   (to Laser)
               He's not gonna make it.
                   (calling to Clay)
               Clay, you're not gonna make it!

                         LASER
               I think he may be right, dude.
               Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
                         CLAY
               Will you quit being a man-gina and
               run the camera! I'm only doing
               this once so keep my shit in frame!
     Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser,
     wondering why he puts up with this guy.

     VIDEO CAMERA'S POV: We watch as Clay psychs himself up   with
     an assortment of deep breaths and head-slaps. Finally,   he
     starts down the ledge. He starts his jump, catches air   and
     hits the edge of the dumpster and falls. We see him go   into
     the dumpster and land with a nauseating THUD. Paul and   Laser
     rush up and look over the edge.
                         PAUL/LASER
               ARE YOU OKAY?!

     There's Clay, his arm bent at a disturbing angle, in agony.
                         CLAY
               Did you get that?!

                         LASER
               Seriously, dude, are you okay?

                         CLAY
               I'm fucking fine! Fuck! Did you
               fucking get it?!

     EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CLAY'S HOUSE - LATER
55                                                              55

     Paul and Laser walk over to Paul's truck.
                                                          45.

                    PAUL
          Maybe next time we can hang out
          just you and me.
                    LASER
          Clay's cool. He's just gets a
          little amped sometimes.

                    PAUL
          That's not amped.    That's being a
          dick.
                    LASER
          He's not a dick, that's just his
          way.
                    PAUL
          Okay...I just didn't like the way
          he was talking to you.

                    LASER
              (defensive)
          Well, you don't know him.

                    PAUL
              (back-peddling)
          You're right...I don't...

                    LASER
          Hey, can I ask you a question?
                       PAUL
          Sure.

                    LASER
          Why'd you donate sperm?
                    PAUL
          Well, it's a lot more fun then
          donating blood.
Laser doesn't laugh.    Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a
"non-joke" answer.

                    PAUL (CONT'D)
          I don't know, I guess I thought,
          you know, if I can help somebody in
          need, somebody who wants a baby...

Laser's not really buying that.
                    LASER
          So you did it to help people?
                                                               46.

                         PAUL
               It was a long time ago...

                         LASER
               How much did you get paid?

                         PAUL
               Why do you want to know?
                         LASER
               I'm just curious.
                         PAUL
               I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop.

                            LASER
               That's it?

                         PAUL
               It was worth more back then.     You
               know. With inflation...
                   (off Laser's look)
               Hey, I'm glad I did it...

     Laser doesn't quite buy Paul's altruism.    He looks over at
     him, then away.

     INT. JONI'S ROOM - DAY
56                                                                  56

     Jai and Joni and Sasha play Scrabble.    Sasha checks out the
     photos of Paul on Joni's phone.

                         SASHA
               Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox.
                         JAI
               Must you take everything beautiful
               and make it dirty?

                         SASHA
               I'm just saying. Spermster's a
               hottie. Is he single?

                         JONI
               Okay, first of all, ewww. Second,
               he's a really good person and I'd
               prefer it if you didn't taint him
               with your whore juice.

     Sasha hops up, energized by the banter.
                                                                47.

                          SASHA
               Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta
               here. You love birds can split my
               letters...

     Sasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous
     tension.

                         JONI
               You want to keep playing?

                           JAI
               Sure.

     As Jai incorporates Sasha's tiles into his own, we see Joni
     gathering her nerve to make a move. Jai probably feels it
     but in his nervousness he can't look at Joni.

                         JAI (CONT'D)
               Sometimes I feel sorry for Sasha,
               you know...
                           JONI
               Yeah...

     Joni starts to move in, her face draws closer to Jai's, inch
     by inch.

     Somehow, deep down, Jai can sense her moving towards him
     which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same
     time. To the point where he lets slip...
                         JAI
               It's like she has to sexualize
               every experience, you know? It's
               just sad...
     That stops Joni in her tracks.

                         JONI
               Yeah, it is. It's really sad.
     Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it.


     INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT
57                                                                57
     Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin man-PJ's, sitting at
     the rim of a RUNNING BATH. There are candles burning.

                           JULES
               Wow.    What's this?
                                                              48.

                       NIC
          Come here.     Sit down.

Jules takes a seat beside her.       Nic holds her hand.

                    NIC (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry I've been such a bitch
          lately. I know I'm not being my
          highest self.

                    JULES
          Yeah, well...

                    NIC
          You've been really patient with me.
          I just want you to know that hasn't
          gone unrecognized.

Nic gives her a long, sweet kiss.      Jules is warming up.

                       NIC (CONT'D)
          Get in.

CUT TO - JULES

In the tub, revelling in the warm bubbly water.      Nic is
sitting on the ledge, massaging her feet.

                    JULES
          Oh god, chicken, that's the spot.
                    NIC
          How's the water?

                      JULES
          Perfect.    You wanna come in?
                       NIC
          In a bit.     You enjoy it first.

Nic goes deeper with the massage.      Jules' eyes roll back.
                    NIC (CONT'D)
          Oh, I forgot the lavender salts.

Nic starts to get up.    Jules grabs her hand.
                    JULES
          No, don't stop...

                    NIC
          No, I meant to put `em in....
                                                               49.

     Nic gets up and sashays to the door.

                            NIC (CONT'D)
                  Don't move...

     Nic exits.    Jules sinks back, wishing Nic had stayed.

     CUT TO JULES - MINUTES LATER
58                                                               58

     Still waiting.    Getting impatient and upset.
                            JULES
                  Nic?!!

     No response.
     CUT TO THE KITCHEN --
54                                                               54

     Nic is on her cell with a patient, a glass of wine in her
     hand. Jules walks in wearing a bathrobe. Nic turns. Raises
     a finger and mouths: "Sorry..."

                             NIC
                  No, we're planning on being here
                  through mid-August so...
                      (beat)
                  No, I promise, I'm not going
                  anywhere.

     Jules' face drops; she turns and leaves.

     OMITTED.
59                                                               59

     INT./EXT.    PAUL'S HOUSE - DAY
60                                                               60

     Paul watches Jules work in his backyard.    Luis hauls shrubs.

     INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER
61                                                               61

     Paul and Jules stand at the kitchen table, looking over her
     sketch for the yard.
                            JULES
                  Look, I'm gonna go to the nursery
                  in the morning so we should
                  probably make sure you're signed
                  off on the Bougainvillea...

     Jules looks over at a pan on the kitchen counter.
                                                           50.

                    JULES (CONT'D)
          What's that?

                     PAUL
          Strawberry rhubarb pie.      Fresh from
          my garden.

Paul hands her a fork and she takes a big bite.     Her eyes
roll back in her head.

                       PAUL (CONT'D)
          Good, huh?

                       JULES
          Oh my god.     That is criminal.
                       PAUL
          Have more.

                    JULES
          No, please, just take it away...
                    PAUL
          You had one bite.

                    JULES
          I have another you may as well just
          tape it to my ass cause that's
          where it'll end up.

                    PAUL
          Hey now, don't go negative on your
          ass.

Jules blushes at all this talk of her ass.
                    JULES
          So...you're good with the plants?
              (off his silence)
          Look, we don't have to do that. We
          could do go in a totally different
          direction if you--

                    PAUL
          No, I'm just thinking. Hang on.
              (covers his eyes)
          Yeah, I'm good with the plants.

                    JULES
          Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence
          for criticism.
                                                          51.

                    PAUL
          I wasn't criticizing you.

                     JULES
          No, I know...I just...
              (beat)
          Sometimes Nic can be a little
          critical, you know. She's a
          perfectionist.

                    PAUL
          That doesn't mean you have to be
          negative.

Jules looks away.    We HEAR a knock from the back.
                    LUIS (O.S.)
          Excuse me, Senora? Hello?

Jules turns, sees Luis standing at the glass door.
                       JULES
          What's up?

                       LUIS
          5 o'clock.
                       JULES
          Yeah.     Okay.

Jules wants Luis to leave her alone.    But he's not going.
                    LUIS
          Same time tomorrow?

                      JULES
          Yes!    Same time!

Luis leaves.   Jules turns back to Paul, laughs nervously.

                       JULES (CONT'D)
          Okay.     I'm gonna take off too...

                    PAUL
              (in Luis's accent)
          Same time tomorrow?
Jules pushes Paul, laughing.

                    JULES
          That's mean.

Paul hands her a Tupperware with some of the pie in it.
                                                              52.

                         PAUL
               Here, take this...

                           JULES
               No!

                         PAUL
               Just give it to the kids.
                          JULES
               Okay!   God, you're such a pusher!
     Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost
     as a mistake. Before they know it, they're making out.

     Jules snaps back, freaked.
                         JULES (CONT'D)
               Whoa. I'm sorry. That was...I
               don't know where that came from...
                         PAUL
                   (freaked himself)
               It's okay...

                          JULES
               Okay.   I'm gonna go now...

     Jules starts backing away, acting as if nothing happened.

                           PAUL
               Jules...?

                         JULES
                   (overcompensating)
               ...but I shall return!
     Jules bolts for the door, clutching her pie.   Paul watches

     Nic's in bed reading a magazine. Jules gets in bed,
     paranoid. Nic puts her magazine down.
                         NIC
               So how'd it go with Paul?

                         JULES
                   (jumpy)
               What do you mean?
                                                               53.

                         NIC
               I don't know. Did you break
               ground? Did you dig in? I don't
               know the terms.

                         JULES
               No, we just talked...conceptually.

                         NIC
               Oh, so it was less of a "doing"
               day, huh? Was he okay with that?
                         JULES
               You know, maybe we should lay off
               the Paul digs a little.
                          NIC
               Okay.   You're right.

     Chastened, Nic looks back at her magazine.    Jules rolls over.
                         JULES
               And I also think we should start
               composting.

     Sweating and dirty, Joni and Paul pull radishes from the
     ground. They're in a zone together. Paul takes off his sun-
     hat and put it on Joni's head.

                         PAUL
               You got your mom's fair skin.     You
               didn't get my Mediterranean
               genes...

                           JONI
               Thanks...

     Joni's cell rings.    She looks.   Rolls her eyes.

                           JONI (CONT'D)
               Ugh.    Ignore.

     Joni hits the ignore button, puts her cell away.

                         PAUL
               Who's that?
                                                             54.

                         JONI
               My mom, Nic. She's making me
               insane.
                          PAUL
               Why?   What's she doing?

                         JONI
               She's treating me like I'm 12.
               It's like she doesn't want to admit
               I'm an adult.
                         PAUL
               She's your mom.     That's her job.

                         JONI
               What? To smother me to death?
               That's not her job.

                         PAUL
               Well, if you want things to be
               different, you've got to make that
               happen. That's your job.

     Laser walks with Clay. Clay sports a homemade arm-cast for
     the skateboard mishap we witnessed earlier.

                         CLAY
               That jump was cake, dude!    I so
               could've made it.

                         LASER
               You were like 20 feet short, dude!
               There was no way.

                         CLAY
               Yeah, well if Paul wasn't there I
               could have landed it. That guy
               creeps me out.

                           LASER
               Whatever.
                         CLAY
               He's kind of a fag, dude. Tryin'
               to act all like your dad and shit.

     Laser doesn't know how to respond so he ignores the comment.
     A stray DOG comes up to them. Laser stops to pet it.
                                                           55.

                       LASER
          Hey buddy.     Good boy.

Laser sees the dog has no tags. He looks around for an
owner. The dog nuzzles Laser for affection.

                    LASER (CONT'D)
          I've seen this dog around.        I
          wonder if he's lost.

                    CLAY
          Let's pee on his head.

                       LASER
          What?
Clay unzips his fly.     It's difficult with the plaster cast.

                    LASER (CONT'D)
          Dude, don't do that.
                       CLAY
          Come on.     Hold him...

Clay yanks the dog by his scruff.
                    LASER
          Dude, Quit it!

                    CLAY
              (mocking)
          Duuude, quit it!

Suddenly, Laser gets it. His friend is the tool.     He grabs
the dog and smacks him to get him to run away.
                       LASER
          Go!   Run!    Get out of here!

The dog TAKES OFF.     Clay shoves Laser.
                    CLAY
          Why are you such a fag?!

Laser shoves Clay back hard.
                    LASER
          Why are you such a dick?!

Clay HITS Laser in the mouth. Laser touches his lip.     Sees
blood, and walks away. Friendship over.
                                                               56.

     Paul and Joni walk to his motorcycle parked in the dirt lot
     behind them. Paul grabs his helmet off the bike, hands it to
     Joni.

                         PAUL
               Here, put this on.
     Joni takes the helmet and puts it on. Paul fastens the
     buckle for her. They get on the bike and take off down the
     hill.

     The ladies sit in the living room watching TV.

                          JULES
               Relax. She'll get home when she
               gets home.

                         NIC
               Quit telling me to relax!
     They go back to watching TV.   After a beat, we HEAR a
     motorcycle pull up.

                         NIC (CONT'D)

     Paul and Joni climb off the bike. Nic storms out of the
     house to intercept them by the sidewalk.

                         NIC
               Funny how someone conveniently
               forgot to tell me they were driving
               home on a motorcycle!

                         JONI
               Mom...
                                                57.

                    NIC
          You know how many people I've seen
          come into the hospital paralyzed
          from motorcycle accidents?!

                    PAUL
          I'm a very safe rider...

                    NIC
          That is so not the point I'm
          making! Joni knows this is
          something I'd never allow.

                    JONI
          Mom, I'm 18 years old! I won't
          even be living here in like next
          month!

                    NIC
          Yeah, well, you're living here now!
                    JONI
          Yeah, well why don't you get a jump
          on it and pretend like I'm not!

Joni storms off.   Nic glowers at Paul.
                    NIC
          She's never talked to me like that.

                    PAUL
              (trying to soften it)
          You know, Nic. If you eased up on
          the restrictions, maybe there'd be
          less tension...
                    NIC
              (marinated in sarcasm)
          Really? You think so, Paul?     Is
          that how it works?
Jules walks up to intervene.

                    JULES
          What's going on?
                    NIC
          Oh, nothing. Paul's just giving me
          child-rearing lessons.

                    PAUL
          I was just saying--
                                                               58.

                         NIC
               Listen, when you've been a parent
               for 18 years, come talk to me!
                         PAUL
               I was just making an observation.

                         NIC
               Yeah, and I need your observations
               like I need a dick in my ass!

     Nic storms off.   Jules follows.   Paul watches, shell shocked.

     Joni opens the door.

               I know how you feel about them.
               But I'm an adult now and you have

     From his house, Paul watches Jules working on her knees in
     the garden.
     CLOSE ON Jules' thong peaking out of her jeans. Luis walks
     across Paul's field of vision, interrupting his reverie.

     Jules steps tentatively into Paul's house.
                                                            59.

                      JULES
          Paul?

Jules walks further into the house. She looks anxious.      Paul
opens his office door and sees Jules in the hall.

                      PAUL
          Hey.    What's up?
                    JULES
          Look, I'm sorry about last night.
          I'm really embarrassed.

                      PAUL
          Don't be.    She's the one who wigged
          out.
                    JULES
          I know, she's just going through a
          lot of stuff right now...
                    PAUL
          Jules, it's okay.      You don't have
          to defend her.

They stare at each other, unsure how to act.
                    JULES
          And look, I just want you to know,
          about the other day, the kiss,
          that's not something I...do.
                    PAUL
          Yeah, I sensed that.

She takes a step toward him, feverish.
                    JULES
          I just wanted to clear the air.

They stare at each other.      It's like watching two magnets.
                    PAUL
          The air is clear.

Jules grabs Paul and starts smothering him with kisses.
It takes a second for Paul to get his bearings, but when he
does, he starts kissing her back with equal fervor, pushing
her up against the wall, wedging his hand between her legs.
                    JULES
          Paul, I can't!
                                                              60.

                           PAUL
                 You don't want to?!

                           JULES
                 No, I do! It's just...
                     (urgent whisper)
                 I have a guy outside!

     Overcome with lust, Jules wraps her legs around his waist and
     Paul walks her into...

     Quick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings. Somewhere
     between slapstick and animal. He pulls her hair back hard.
     She loves it. She pulls his hair back harder. He yelps.
     She pulls down his underwear. Her eyes widen. It's been
     decades since she's seen a hard cock in the flesh.

                               JULES
                 Oh.   Well.     Hel-lo!

     Cut to them fucking. It's gawky and passionate.    Somewhere
     in the middle of it, Jules starts laughing.
                               PAUL
                 What?

                               JULES
                 Nothing.
     Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some
     more.

     She keeps laughing. Paul goes harder to make her stop. The
     paces grows quicker. They're getting closer. And then...

                            LUIS (O.S.)
                 Hello?   Excuse me, Senora Allgood?!
     They stop mid-thrust.

               The stones? Over by the fence.

     Luis stares at his employer. She looks totally disheveled.
     Jules starts feeling her hair, smoothing it into shape.

                   (defensive)
               What? I was using the bathroom.
                   (then)
               Do you need to use the bathroom?

     Luis stares at her feet.       She looks down.   She's barefoot.

     Paul and Laser shoot hoop. There's a tense-ness to their
     patter. Laser takes the ball and steps to the top of the key
     and shoots. Drains it.

                            LASER
               That's H.
                            PAUL
               I know.

     Laser steps up to left side of the basket, calls his shot.
                            LASER
               Lay-up.

                         PAUL
               Hey, don't take it easy on me cause
               you're winning--

     Laser does a trick behind the back lay-up.        Nails it.   Then
     tosses the ball to Paul.
                         PAUL (CONT'D)
               Nobody likes a show-off.

                         LASER
               Hey, can I ask you a question?
                                                             62.

                          PAUL
               Oh god.   Okay. Hit me.

                         LASER
               When you die do you want to be
               buried or cremated?

                         PAUL
               That's your question?

                         LASER
               I want to be cremated.

                         PAUL
               I think I'd rather be buried.
                         LASER
               Why? That's just taking up more
               space in the earth.

                         PAUL
               I don't know, something about the
               idea of being burned into this
               chalky powder and sprinkled--

                         LASER
               What do you care?   You won't even
               be conscious.

                         PAUL
               That's true. I guess I just want
               to be in a place where people can
               visit me.

                         LASER
                   (growing animated)
               But why?! You'll be dead! You
               won't even know they're there!

     Joni and Sasha are at a table eating dinner. Tanya has
     temporarily joined them. Sasha checks out Tanya's oversized
     African bead necklace. Joni watches Paul charm customers.
                         SASHA
               God, I love your necklace!   Where'd
               you get it?

                         TANYA
               I don't know, some flea market--
                                                           63.

                       SASHA
          In Africa?

                    TANYA
          No, more like Pasadena.

                    SASHA
          Well, it's really awesome.
Paul saunters up to the table and stands behind Sasha.   He
mindlessly places his hand on Sasha's shoulder.
                    PAUL
          Sorry guys, I need to steal Tanya
          back now.
Sasha clocks Paul's hand. She carefully and without looking
back places her hand on top of his.

                    SASHA
          That's okay, Paul.
                    TANYA
              (getting up)
          Well ladies, it was fun talking
          with you.
                       SASHA/JONI
          You too.

Paul pulls his hand away from Sasha's and walks off with
Tanya. Sasha turns to Joni.

                    SASHA
          Okay, I'm sorry but your donor
          daddy is giving me the sex vibe.
                    JONI
          No he's not. He wouldn't do that.

                      SASHA
          Why not?    He's not my dad.

                    JONI
          God Sasha, that's totally gross!
          Not everybody wants to have sex
          with you, okay? Especially when
          you act like a slut.

                       SASHA
          Fuck you.
                                                               64.

                          JONI
               Well it makes you seem insecure and
               desperate.
                         SASHA
               I'm not insecure and desperate!
               I'm just a normal sexual person!
               And maybe you'd get that if you
               weren't so uptight!

                           JONI
               Fuck you.    I'm not uptight!

     Nic and Jules dine with their friends, JOEL and STELLA.
     Nic's drinking like a fish.

                         STELLA
               Oh my god, these heirloom tomatoes
               are insane.

                         JULES
               Joni brought some home from Paul's
               garden the other day. They were
               huge!

     Nic tightens at the mention of Paul.

                         JOEL
               So, the kids have been spending
               time with him?

                         NIC
               Oh, yeah, they're spending all
               kinds of quality time together.

                         STELLA
                   (senses the sarcasm)
               Well, it's great they like him so
               much.   You know, you hear these
               stories about kids meeting their
               donors and the guys end up being
               nothing like they were on paper.
                         NIC
               No, everyone's getting along
               famously. Apparently Paul can do
               no wrong...
     Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm.
                                                         65.

                    NIC (CONT'D)
          Can we get another bottle of the
          Seavey Cabernet?
Jules gives Nic a look.   Joel and Stella feel the tension
between them.

                    STELLA
          Hey, have you guys tried those Açai
          fruit packs?

                    JULES
          No, but they're pushing them like
          crack at Whole Foods.

                      STELLA
          I know.    Joel's addicted.

                    JOEL
          What I do is I throw one in the
          blender with some bananas, frozen
          strawberries and hemp milk and I'll
          tell you, it's sensational.

Nic slaps her forehead.
                    NIC
          Oh, just fucking kill me...

Everyone stiffens.   Jules is embarrassed.
                      JULES
          Honey...

                    NIC
          I'm sorry guys, but I just can't,
          with the fucking hemp milk and the
          organic farming and heirloom
          tomatoes.
              (mocking-voice)
          "Oh no, don't throw that in the
          trash, no man, you gotta throw that
          into the composting bin so the
          fucking worms can shit all over it
          and turn it into glorious multch
          and we can all feel better about
          ourselves." God! What a bunch of
          bullshit!

Nic takes a big swallow from her glass.   Jules windshield
wipes Nic's forearm.
                                                                66.

                   (sotto)
               How about some green tea, honey...
     Nic slams her glass on the table.   Explodes.

                         NIC
               You know what, Jules?! I like my
               wine! Okay? So fucking sue me!
               And fyi, red wine has a chemical
               called Resveratrol in it, which has
               been proven to significantly extend
               human lifespan!

                         JULES
               Yeah, if you drink a thousand
               bottles a day!

                            NIC
               Fuck you.
     Nic storms off.   Jules turns to Joel and Stella, ashen.

     Jules walks over to the bar. Nic is sitting in the corner.
                         JULES
               What the hell is going on with you?

               crazy! I feel like he's taking
               over my family.

     Jules tries to bring it down.   She yells in hushed tones.

               No. He's not!

     Fucking again in his bedroom. Jules writhes beneath him, her
     eyes closed.   Paul seems to be in some kind of zone. He
     stares at her, enthralled.

     Jules and Paul lie naked in the bed. Jules slithers around
     the covers, stoned on post-coital endorphins.

                          JULES
               God, I feel so drugular right now.
                   (sitting up quickly)
               I really want a cigarette! Do you
               have any? I haven't had a
               cigarette since Laser was born. Do
               you smoke?
                         PAUL
               Sometimes. But I don't have any
               here. Want me to run to the store?

                   (bouncing off the walls)
               Yeah. Wait, no. Don't.     Sorry.

     Jules pops up on her knees, getting in his face.
                         JULES (CONT'D)
               Do you think I'm just like some sad-
               sack middle-aged lesbian?

                         PAUL
               God, that's it. I was trying to
               figure out how to describe you to
               my friends. Thank you.

     Jules punches his arm, mock hurt. They start rough-housing.
     Then kissing. Then the phone rings.

                         JULES
               You want to get that?
                         PAUL
               No. I want to get this...

     Paul grabs a handful of Jules' ass. Jules throws her leg
     over Paul and climbs up for another round. Suddenly, Joni's
     voice echoes through the machine.
                         JONI (ON MACHINE)
               Hi Paul. It's Joni. I just wanted
               to apologize for my friend, Sasha.
               I was really embarrassed when she
               put her hand on your--

     Paul grabs the receiver.
                            PAUL
               Hey, Joni.     I'm here...

     Jules visibly recoils.
                         PAUL (CONT'D)
               Listen, don't worry about your
               friend.
     Jules pales. She mouths: "What are you doing?!"    Paul
     gesticulates: "I'm sorry!"

                         PAUL (CONT'D)
               No. Honestly. I didn't even
               notice...

     Jules throws on her clothes and starts to leave.

                            PAUL (CONT'D)
               Hey, Joni?     Can you hold on a
               second?

     Paul grabs Jules' wrist and mouths "wait!"   Jules rips her
     arm free and walks out.

     Home Depot, sneezing and wiping his nose.

                         JULES
               Did you go to Home Depot?
                          LUIS
               Yeah.   I just got back.

                    LUIS
          Yeah, no lines.

His look of confusion trips off her paranoia.      She's
convinced he knows everything.

                    JULES
          What's that look?
                       LUIS
          What look?
                    JULES
          The look you're giving me right
          now!
                    LUIS
          That's no look.     That just my face.

                    JULES
          Look, I'm not gonna play this game
          with you! You need to keep your
          judgements to yourself!

                    LUIS
          Senora, I didn't give no looks!
                    JULES
          I don't ask you why you keep
          blowing your nose constantly! I
          mean, if you have a drug problem
          that's your business...

                    LUIS
          I don't have no drug problem!
          I have the allergies!
                    JULES
          Then why are you a gardener?!

Luis stares at Jules, innocent.
                    LUIS
          Cause I love the flowers.

                    JULES
          Look, this isn't gonna work. I'll
          pay you through the end of the day
          and then we're done.

Jules walks past a totally confused Luis.
                                                                   71.

     Jules lies on her side. Nic shuffles to get to close to her.
     Jules moves away, still pissed at her. Nic realizes she
     needs to make amends.

     The family sits in silence, having breakfast.     Nic looks
     around the table, feeling like a pariah.
                         NIC
               Look, I know you've all been
               enjoying your time with Paul. And
               I know I haven't been as open to
               him as everyone else and this has
               caused some...friction...between
               us. But I'd like to try and change
               that...
     Everyone keeps eating, uncommitted.   "And...?"

                         NIC (CONT'D)
               So I was thinking. Maybe it would
               be nice if we all had dinner at his
               house sometime. That way, I could
               get to know him a little better,
               and I could see all the good work
               mom's been doing with his backyard.
     Nic looks at Jules and smiles. Everyone nods.     They
     recognize this is a big step for Nic.

     Paul walks out to check on Jules. She's sweating her ass
     off, shlepping stacks of heavy mulch across the yard.

                         PAUL
               How's it going?
                         JULES
               Okay...
                                                                72.

                         PAUL
               Here, let me help.

     Paul takes some of her load and together they transport the
     sod to the other side of the yard. Neither know what to say.

     Paul stares at her, waiting for her lead.

                         JULES
               We can't be doing this...

                           PAUL
               I know...

                         JULES
               I'm married...
                         PAUL
               ...and the kids...

                         JULES
               Yeah, and I love Nic.

                           PAUL

     Paul and Jules lie in bed. Jules looks nauseated.   Paul
     offers her a pack of smokes.

                         PAUL
               I got you some cigarettes.
                         JULES
                   (ignoring him)
               Jesus, what's wrong with me? I
               shouldn't have fired Luis like
               that. That was totally wrong...

                         PAUL
               Come on. Don't be so hard on
               yourself. Things get messy
               sometimes...

                         JULES
               That wasn't messy. That was fucked
               up. I'm totally fucked up...
                                                              73.

                         PAUL
               I think I'm really falling for you.

     Jules takes a shower, washing off the evidence.   She looks
     nauseated by her lack of willpower.

     Tanya walks over to Paul who's on his computer. She flops on
     the couch next to him. He doesn't look up.

                         TANYA
               Pretty good night. That table had
               like 5 bottles of wine.
                           PAUL
               Wow.    Yeah. Good night.

                         TANYA
               Joni's pretty. She's got some of
               your genes.

                         PAUL
               I think she looks more like her mom
               actually. But thank you.

                         TANYA
               It's cute seeing you in dad mode.
                            PAUL
               Yeah?

                         TANYA
               Yeah.
                   (lowering voice)
               It makes me want to fuck you.

                         PAUL
                   (uncomfortable)
               Oh yeah?...

                            TANYA
               Yeah...
     Tanya moves imperceptibly closer.
                                                                 74.

                         TANYA (CONT'D)
               I've been missing our sleep-overs.

     Paul finally stops what he's doing.

                         PAUL
               Yeah, it's been a while.

                         TANYA
               You want to meet up later?

     Paul hesitates.   He doesn't know how to say no.

                         PAUL
               Tanya, you're so sexy and
               beautiful, but I don't think we
               should do that anymore.

     Tanya's face drops.

                         TANYA
               What happened?

                         PAUL
               You know, our thing is really fun
               and easy, but...I don't want to be
               50 and still "hanging out." You
               know? If I really want a family
               then I have to stop getting in
               these situations that don't go
               anywhere.
     Paul just looks at her.   Tanya gets it.

                           TANYA
                     (welling up)
               Oh.

     Paul knows enough to say nothing.      Tanya gets up and walks
     off.
                           TANYA (CONT'D)
               Fuck you.

     Paul sits there, feeling like an asshole.

     Paul gets dinner ready with Joni and Laser as his sous-chefs.
     Both kids seem really jazzed to be cooking with him.

     IN THE BACKYARD -EVENING

     Jules tours Nic around the backyard, looking a little freaked
     out as she shows her the work she's been doing.

                         JULES
               I'm gonna do some planting over
               there so it won't look so bare...

                         NIC
               It looks great, honey. Very
               indigenous. I'm so proud of you.

     Nic kisses Jules spontaneously. Jules looks nauseous again.
     They head back up the stairs, toward Paul's house.
                         NIC (CONT'D)
               Hey, so how's that guy Luis working
               out?

                         JULES
               Oh, I had to fire him.

                   (surprised)
               Really?!
                         JULES
               Yeah, he had a drug problem.

                          NIC
               Whoa.   What kind of drugs?

                         JULES

     Everyone digs into the meal, enjoying themselves.   Especially
     Nic, who's committed to redeeming herself.
                                                        76.

                    PAUL
          Hey Nic, I think you're gonna love
          this `98 Screaming Eagle.
                    NIC
          You know what, I think I'm gonna
          stick with water tonight. But
          thank you so much.
The Allgoods look at Nic: this is a first.

                    NIC (CONT'D)
          God, Paul, this steak is delicious.
          What's the seasoning?

                    PAUL
          I just mist it with a little
          truffle oil.

Nic looks at Jules and smiles in full overcompensation mode.
                    NIC
          What a good idea. We should try
          that. Right, honey?

                    JULES
              (taken aback by Nic's
               cheerfulness)
          Mmm-hmmm.

                    NIC
          And it's done to perfection.

                    PAUL
          So it's not too rare?
                    NIC
          No, it's perfect. Juicy. Tender.
          Exactly what rare's supposed to be.

                    PAUL
          Good. A lot of people in the
          restaurant order a steak rare and
          they freak out at the slightest
          sight of red.
                    NIC
          Ugh, isn't that annoying? That
          happens to me all the time when I'm
          grilling.
                                                         77.

                    PAUL
          Don't people know that rare means
          red?
                     NIC
          Right?!   It means bloody!

                    PAUL
          Exactly! They should see what rare
          looks like in Argentina. The cow's
          practically still mooing.
Laser chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in.   Joni tries
to insert herself in the conversation.

                    JONI
          I really want to go to Argentina.
          Buenos Aires is supposed to be--

                    NIC
              (interrupting)
          ...So Paul, I was checking out your
          album collection over there. Quite
          the eclectic mix...

                      PAUL
          Thanks...

                    NIC
          You don't meet too many straight
          guys who love Joni Mitchell.
Joni glares at Nic: stop being such a Paul hog.

                    PAUL
          Oh yeah, you a Joni Mitchell fan?
                     NIC
              (smug)
          Not really. We just named our
          daughter after her.
                    PAUL
          Cool. Right on...

                    NIC
          What's your favorite Joni album?

                    PAUL
          I think I have to go with "Blue."
Nic raises her hand in a testify.
                                                        78.

                     PAUL (CONT'D)
          Yeah?   You too?

They high-five across the table.

                    NIC
          Oh God, I probably spent half of
          high school in my room crying to
          that album. That record kills me.

                    PAUL
          I know, it never lets up, you got
          "River," "California..."

                    NIC
          "A Case of You..."
                    PAUL
          "All I Want.."

                     NIC
          Mmm!!

Nic pulls her hands to her chest, shuts her eyes...and starts
to sing.
                    NIC (CONT'D)
          I am on a lonely road and I am

Jules, Paul and the kids watch, open-mouthed as Nic soldiers
on, skipping ahead to another verse.

                    NIC (CONT'D)
          I want to talk to you/I want to

          Life is our cause/When I think of
          your kisses/My mind see-saws...

Nic takes a breath. Just as Paul's about to say something,
Nic resumes her unfortunate solo.

                    NIC (CONT'D)
          Do you see/do you see/do you see
          how you hu-urt me baby/so I hurt

Nic stops, eyes still closed. She's connected to a part of
herself she rarely lets herself visit. The moment is

          Don't quit your day job, mom.

                    PAUL
          Hey. It's hard enough to open your
          heart in this world. Don't make it
          harder.
                    LASER
          You're right.
              (to Nic; contrite)
          I'm sorry, mom.
Nic looks at Paul.    Stunned.   Then looks at Jules and points
to Paul.

                    NIC
          I like this guy.

Paul looks at Joni.

                    PAUL
          You didn't tell me you were named
          after Joni M.

                    JONI
          It's just so dorky. I don't really
          like to bring it up.

                    PAUL
          I think it's cool.
                    NIC
              (getting up)
          Hey Paul. Where's your bathroom?

                    PAUL
          Just around there.

On her way to the loo, Nic turns back to Paul.

                    NIC
          You know what? I think I will try
          some of that Screaming Eagle.
                                                                 80.

     Nic washes her hands at the sink. Something catches her eye.
     She lifts Paul's hairbrush from the shelf in front of her and
     examines it. She reaches into the bristles and pulls out...

     A few strands of long red hair.

     Nic pales.

     CUT TO
     Nic on her knees in Paul's shower, pulling a clump of tell-
     tale red hair from the drain.

     CUT TO
     Nic skulks out of the bathroom.   She looks out and b-lines
     for the bedroom.

     CUT TO
     Nic pulling pillows off Paul's bed.   Her look tells us she's
     found hair here as well.

     THEN WE CUT TO
     Nic sitting back down at the table. She looks drained.
     Nobody notices. The sound drops out.

     NIC'S POV:
     Paul and Jules talking comfortably.

     Joni and Laser chiming in, smiling, one big happy family.
     REVERSE ONTO NIC:

     Totally disconnected. Shell-shocked. She wants to scream
     but it feels like she's trapped in cement. Things slow way
     down...

     Nic turns to her, eyes red with anger.

                         NIC
               Just be honest with me. Don't make
               me feel crazier than I feel right
               now!

               What? I was working.    I got dirty
               so I took a shower.
                          NIC

                          JONI
                I like the scruff.   It's sexy.

      Waify girl juts out her hip territorially.
                          WAIFY GIRL
                Uh, `scuuuse me...

                          JONI
                You're excused.
                    (then back to Jai)
                Hey, can I talk to you?

      Joni leads Jai to a private corner.
                                                                  88.

      She leans in and kisses Jai. And Jai actually returns the
      kiss. And it's completely sweet and intimate.

      But then the kiss starts to morph as Joni's energy turns
      manic, intense, less romantic than emotionally needy. We see
      Jai start to pull away. But Joni keeps holding him, wanting
      more. Finally, Jai breaks off the kiss.

                             JAI
                   Joni...Joni...

                             JONI
                   What?

      Joni looks pained, embarrassed.      Jai keeps holding her hands.
                             JAI
                   Are you okay?

                             JONI
                   Yeah, I'm fine...
      Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her
      wake.

      Jules walks in to find Nic, awake, in bed.

                             JULES
                   Just getting another pillow.   The
                   couch is kind of saggy.

                             NIC
                   Is your back okay?
      Jules perks up: is this an invitation to share the bed again?

                             JULES
                   It's a little ache-y.
                             NIC
                   You should take some Advil.

      Guess not.
      Suddenly they hear bumping and loud footsteps downstairs.
                                                                 89.

      Jules walks downstairs to find Joni stumbling toward her
      bedroom.

                            JULES
                Hey.    How was the party?

      Joni tries to avert her mom's questioning gaze.

                            JONI
                Fine.

                          JULES
                How big was it?
                          JONI
                I don't know. Medium...ish...

      Jules takes in the glassy look in her daughter's eyes.
                          JULES
                Are you drunk?

                            JONI
                No.
      Nic enters from the stairs, having caught the last piece.

                          NIC
                I hope you had a designated driver.
                            JONI
                Why?    I'm not drunk.

                          NIC
                Well, you seem drunk to me.

                          JONI
                Yeah, well, you should know.
                          NIC
                    (furious; incredulous)
                What did you just say to me?!

                          JONI
                I'm going to bed.

      Joni starts to leave.   Nic grabs her.

                          NIC
                No, you're not!    I'm not done
                talking to you!
                                                                90.

      Laser opens his door and watches the scene progress.

                          JONI
                What do you want from me?! I did
                everything you wanted! I got all
                A's! I got in everywhere I applied!
                Now you can show everybody what a
                perfect family you have!
                          JULES
                Don't talk to your mom like that!
      Joni spins to face Jules.

                          JONI
                You're really gonna tell me how to
                act? Now?!

                          JULES
                Hey, I'm still your mother.
                          JONI
                Whatever...

      Jules reaches out and Joni backs away, sickened.
                          JONI (CONT'D)
                Don't touch me!

      Joni heads for her room.
                          JONI (CONT'D)
                I'm so sick of both of you!

      Jules wakes up on the couch.   Sits up.   Rubs her aching back.

      Joni packs for college. The room is littered with half-
      filled packing boxes. She picks up a pile of clothes from
      the corner and sees the farmer's hat Paul gave her. She puts
      it aside, not sure what to do with it.
                                                                 91.

      Paul looks around his newly landscaped yard.     It looks more
      abandoned than revived.

      The family has their last supper - before Joni leaves.

                          NIC
                Did you pack that lamp I gave you?

                            JONI
                Yeah.
                          NIC
                Well, we can always get stuff up
                there, too, if you need it, I mean
                if the room's dark or you need
                extra bedding...
                          JONI
                I'm not going to Siberia, mom.

      Jules looks at the family unit, misty.
                          JULES
                I can't believe this is our last
                dinner together.
                          LASER
                Oh God, are you gonna cry?

      Jules looks at her son, fed up.
                          JULES
                I wish you were gay.    You'd be so
                much more sensitive.

      The doorbell rings.
                          JONI
                It's probably Sasha.    I'll get it.

      Joni runs to the door.   Opens it. It's not Sasha.   It's Paul.
                          JONI (CONT'D)
                    (shocked)
                What are you doing here?
                                                                92.

                          PAUL
                I needed to talk to you before you
                left.
                          JONI
                There's nothing to talk about.

                          PAUL
                I just want to apologize again for
                what happened. I can't tell you
                how much I regret it.

      Joni walks out for privacy, closes the door behind her.
                          JONI
                So like, everything that happened
                between us. What was that? Was
                that just bullshit?!
                          PAUL
                No, it wasn't bullshit at all. I
                know I don't seem credible right
                now but I really care about you...
      Paul struggles to keep his emotions in check.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
                ...and I just hope someday we'll be
                able to see each other again. Do
                you think that could maybe happen?

                          JONI
                I don't know...
      Joni looks down welling up.

                          JONI (CONT'D)
                I just wish you could've been...
                            PAUL
                What?

      Joni chokes back tears.
                            JONI
                Better...

      Paul and Joni look up at each other when the door suddenly
      flings open. Nic is there, fuming.
                                                                93.

                          NIC
                You've got some balls, mister!

                          PAUL
                Nic, hold on...

      Nic walks toward he and Joni.   Joni ducks back inside.

                          NIC
                No, you hold on! Let me tell you
                something, you really hurt my kids!
                          PAUL
                Well, they're kinda my...

                          NIC
                    (cutting him off)
                No! They're not. This is not your
                family. This is my family! You're
                just a fucking interloper...
      Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand.

                          PAUL
                I didn't mean to hurt anyone...
      Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace.

                          NIC
                If you want a family so much, go
                out and make one of your own!
      Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her.

      Paul stand alone, spinning. After a moment he spontaneously
      looks back into the house. Laser is staring at him through
      the window. Their eyes lock and Paul give Laser a contrite
      smile. That's the final straw for Laser. He grabs his plate
      and walks out of view.

      Reeling, Paul heads for his motorcycle. He gets on the bike,
      helmet in hand. Turns on the ignition. He picks up the
      helmet and pauses, shaking in the hell of his own making.
      Losing it, he hurls the helmet at the motorcycle.

      Laser, Joni and Nic watch "Locked Up Abroad" Jules walks in
      front of them, picks up the remote and turns off the TV.
                          JULES
                I need to say something.
                                                                94.

      Everyone sits up.   Jules acts stoic but she's wrecked.

                           JULES (CONT'D)
                 Look, it's no big secret your mom
                 and are in hell right now. Bottom
                 line...marriage is hard...really
                 fucking hard. Just two people,
                 slogging through the shit, year
                 after year, getting older,
                 changing. It's a fucking marathon,
                 okay?!
      Everyone is silenced by the outpouring.   Jules soldiers on.

                           JULES (CONT'D)
                 So sometimes you're together so
                 long, you just stop seeing the
                 other person. You just see weird
                 projections of your own junk. And
                 instead of talking to each other,
                 you go off the rails, and act
                 grubby and make stupid choices.
                 Which is what I did. And I feel
                 sick about it because I love you
                 guys and I love your mom and that's
                 the truth. Sometimes you hurt the
                 ones you love the most. I don't
                 know why. Maybe if I read more
                 Russian novels I would...

      Nic looks down, overwhelmed by it all.
                            JULES (CONT'D)
                 Anyway, I just wanted to say how
                 sorry I am about what I did and
                 that I hope you'll forgive me
                 eventually.
                     (awkward)
                 Thank you.

      And, without further ado, Jules hands the remote back to
      Laser and departs the field. Everyone's silenced by Jules'
      rambling apologia, especially Nic.

      on the walls. The floor is covered with boxes taped and
      labeled. It's time to go.

      The Allgoods pull up to the curb, get out.   Laser piles
      Joni's boxes on his skateboard.


      EXT. FRONT OF DORM - DAY
127                                                               127
      Laser dollies Joni's boxes though the corridor and while Joni
      and the moms follow behind.


      INT. DORM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
      Nic and Jules follow Joni to the door.    They all jam up at
      the threshold.

                           JONI
                 Guys, it's okay.   I got it.

      Nic and Jules get the hint. They move back and Joni enters
      the room alone. Nic and Jules quietly turn and leave.
                                                                96.

      INT. JONI'S DORM ROOM - BEDROOM - LATER
128                                                              128

      Joni stands among her bags and boxes looking around. She
      goes into her suitcase and pulls out her linens. She starts
      making her bed but suddenly stops mid way. She stares out
      toward the hallway.

      Finally she moves to the doorway and looks out.    She realizes
      her family isn't there.

      EXT. DORM BUILDING - DAY
129                                                              129

      Joni exits, looking around to find her family. The station
      wagon is gone. She looks panicked. Her pace quickens as she
      makes her way down a hill toward the road.
      Finally Joni sees the Volvo heading towards her.

      The car pulls over to the curb and everyone gets out.   Joni
      looks vulnerable. She tries to cover it.
                          JONI
                Where'd you go?!

                          NIC
                We had to move the car.

                          JONI
                I thought you left.
                          JULES
                We wouldn't leave without saying
                goodbye.

                          NIC
                Give us some credit.

      And suddenly, everyone realizes...this is it. It's time to
      say goodbye. First Laser comes up and hugs Joni.
                          LASER
                It's gonna be weird not having you
                at home.

                          JONI
                Sorry to leave you alone with them.

                             LASER
                It's okay.     I can handle it.
      Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni,
      tears streaming down their faces.
                                                               97.

                           JONI
                Guys, come on...
                    (beat)
                Look, I'll talk to you soon.

      Joni tries to detach from the hug. But her moms won't let
      go. They keep holding her and crying.

      Slowly, their tears begin to break Joni down.

      Trapped in their loving embrace, Joni's feelings rise up,
      unbidden, overpowering her. She starts crying.

      The moms hold her tighter, which makes her cry even harder.

      Soon she's sobbing in her mothers' arms, as all the pressure,
      resentment and anger she's felt starts seeping out of her.

      Nic and Jules feel their daughter letting go.   They hold her
      tight to comfort her.
      They keep holding her until a calm sets in.

      The hug breaks apart. Nic pushes the hair from Joni's face.
      Joni gives her moms one last smile.
      Laser, Jules and Nic get back in the car. Joni stands
      watching as they drive off and her new life begins.


      INT. STATION WAGON - DAY
130                                                               130
      The family drives home. Jules is at the wheel. Nic's in the
      passenger seat, eyes red and puffy. Laser's in the back.

      No one speaks, everyone's lost in their own worlds.   Finally
      Laser breaks the spell.

                          LASER
                I don't think you guys should break
                up.
      A long beat.

                           NIC
                No?   Why's that?
                          LASER
                I think you're too old.

      Both Nic and Jules crack smiles. Their son's rudeness is
      unsurpassed. But then his words have an unexpected gravity.
                                                            98.

                     NIC
           Thanks, Laser.

Jules, disarmed and slightly smiling, reaches over and puts
her hand on Nic's leg. She gives it a gentle squeeze and
doesn't let go. Nic looks over to Jules, finally disarmed.

Nic reaches for Jules' hand and holds it tight.   Nic and
Jules look at each other, and then away.

Laser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat.
Their small gesture is what he needed. He smiles to himself,
grateful for a sign.

QUOTE FADES OUT

WE STAY ON BLACK
...breathing continues...

Then a MAN'S VOICE talks over the breathing;



                    MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Do you find me sadistic?

                                                       CUT TO:

BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN
lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has
just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her
face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W
turning the red blood into black blood.

A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME
holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the
corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the
young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice
speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the
audience.
But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that
shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the
"BILL" of the title.

In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes
were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the
planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters.
And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he

corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          I bet I could fry an egg on your
          head about now, if I wanted to.

He continues wiping away the blood.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even
          now, you're aware enough to know
          there isn't a trace of sadism in
          my actions... Okay - Maybe towards
          these other jokers - bot not your.

OVERHEAD SHOT
We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on
the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others
in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is
male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.
We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated
by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending
on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a
white bridal gown.
This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she
will only be referred to as The BRIDE.

Back to CU of The BRIDE.

The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          No Kiddo at this moment, this is me
          at my most masochistic.

While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in
the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and
says;



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.

After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride
receives a bullet in the side of her head.

                                                    CUT TO:

B/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death.

The BRIDE speaks to us in a VO;



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's Tim, Arthur's best friend.

CU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two
bullet holes in her.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's his girlfriend Janeen.

CU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still
clutched in her dead fist.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's my best friend from work
          Erica.

AN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's the minister. I think his
          name was Reverend Hillhouse.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower
print dress.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's his wife.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Organ player, don't know her name.

A YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The

          name on his driver's license was
          Charles Arthur Plympton, but for
          some reason he preferred Arthur.
          Maybe if he went by Carles people
          would have called him Charlie. If
          that was his reason for going by
          Arthur I can understand it.
          Nothing wrong with the name
          Charlie, except he didn't look like
          a Charlie, he looked like an
          Arthur.
          Obviously you'll have to take my
          word on this. Speaking of names, I
          was about two seconds away from
          becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur
          Plympton.

And then finally, The Bride.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.

We do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal
gown

To

The Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the
asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the
past, because she looks like a million dollars
now.......three million even.



INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia
convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A
PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Looked dead, didn't I? Well I
          wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo
          trying, I can tell you that.
          Actually Bill's last bullet put me
          in a coma. A coma I was to lie in
          for five years.
          When I woke up, ...I went on what
          the movie advertisements refer to
          as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I
          roarded and I rampaged and I got
          bloody satisfaction. In all, I've
          killed 33 people to get to this
          piont right now.
          I have only one more.
          The last one.

          The one I'M driving to right now.
          The only one left.
          And when I arrive at my
          destination.....
          .... I'm gonna Kill Bill.


TITLE SEQUENCE

As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the
soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the
Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax.

The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home.

                                           WE FADE TO BLACK

EX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR
WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A
CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR
She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on
something.

The BRIDE'S POV:
A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of
Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the
driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle
the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The
BELLS" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't
see ice cream truck bells.

SUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM:


                        "The city of
                   PASADENA, CALIFORNIA"


We hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks
into the shot, heading for the front door.

EX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell.



EXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY

The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the
same age as The Bride stands in the doorway.
The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the
blonde on her doorstep.

The BRIDE
on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her
eyes.

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see
it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.

The BRIDE ON THE PORCH
We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.



INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY

The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of
the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of
the sofa.

These two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER
the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing
together on the plush carpet.

The HOUSEWIFE
KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the
small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and
the mail is kept.

The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a
FLYING TACKLE from behind by The Bride that sends them both
into........

An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has
framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a
collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the
negro experience in the American military. Starting with a
plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro
troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers
fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war,
the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and
finally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH
THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.

They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked
in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...
When The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.

The HOUSEWIFE
hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and
comes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.

The BRIDE
rises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath
hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,
double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what
Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)

The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally
demolished living room.

The two    woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each
looking    like they know how to use it, each waiting for the
other to    make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep
into the    other one.

Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women
locked in life and death combat......

....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD
LITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.



                       FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
             Mommy, I'm home!

The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat
concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year
old's voice. The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to
the eyes of The Bride.

The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay."

The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons
behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks
into the newly destroyed living room.

The Housewife switches to her mommy voice.



                       THE HOUSEWIFE
             Hey baby, how was school?

The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the
condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a
bar room brawl.



                        LITTLE GIRL
             Mommy, what happened to you and the
             T.V. Room?

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Oh, that good for nothin dog of
          yours, got his little ass in the
          living room and acted a damn fool,
          that's what happened.



                    LITTLE GIRL
          Barney did this?

She says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries
to enter the living room.



                    THE    HOUSEWIFE
          Now baby, you    can't come in here,
          there's broken    glass all over the
          floor, and you    gonna cut yourself.

The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living
room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like
she's been fighting.

The Bride smiles at the confused Little Girl.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          This is a old friend of mommy's I
          ain't seen in a long time.



                     THE BRIDE
          Hello sweety, I'm *(BLEEP)*, what's
          your name?

* Whenever during the picture somebody says The Bride's real
name, it will be BLEEPED OUT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, ...that is,
till I want you to know. *

The shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she
just stares at the blond lady.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Her name is Nikki.



                     THE BRIDE
          Nikki. What a pretty name for such
          a pretty little girl. How old are
          you Nikki?

Nikki still says nothing, only stares.

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Nikki, *(BLEEP)* aked you a
          question.



                    NIKKI
              (to The Bride)
          I'm four.



                       THE BRIDE
          Four years    old, aye. You know I
          once had a    little girl. She'd be
          five right    now. Maybe you two could
          of played    with each other.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Now baby, me an *(BLEEP)* have some
          grown-up talk to talk about, so you
          go in your room now and leave us
          alone till I tell you to come out.

The child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
              (snapping her fingers)
          Nikkia - in your room - now.

The little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the
door of her bedroom.

The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat
both finished.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Want some coffee?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yeah, sure.

The two women move into the kitchen. The Bride re-sheaths her
SOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the
drawer.

The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife
pours both of them coffee.

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Cream and sugar?



                    THE BRIDE
          Both, please.

As The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's
VOICEOVER ON THE SOUNDTRACK:



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          This Pasadena homemaker's name is
          Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.
          Lawrence Bell. But back when we
          were acquainted, five years ago,
          her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her
          code name, was "COBRA"..... Mine
          was BLACK MAMBA.

The two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking
coffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs.



                    THE BRIDE
          Were you expecting me?



                    VERNITA
          Yes and no. Bill got in touch with
          me right after you woke up, and
          then again a little later after
          your episode in Japan.
              (pause)
          So I suppose it's a little late for
          a apology, huh?



                    THE BRIDE
          You suppose correctly.



                    VERNITA
          Even if I was sincere?



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh. I'm quite positive you're
          sorry, now.

Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with
low volume;

                    VERNITA
          Look bitch, I need to know if
          you're gonna start anymore shit
          around my baby girl!



                    THE BRIDE
          You can relax for now. I'm not
          going to murder you in front of
          your daughter.



                    VERNITA
          That's being more rational than
          Bill led me to believe you were
          capable of.



                    THE BRIDE
          Well that's a demonstration of
          Bill's complete ignorance when it
          comes to the subject of me, and
          what I'm thinking, and what I might
          do. It's mercy, compassion, and
          forgiveness I lack, not
          rationality.

She pauses for effect -- the ham.



                    THE BRIDE
          I'll wait for now, but I won't wait
          for long. I'll allow you to choose
          a time and place for us to meet
          again, preferably as far away from
          Nikki as possible.
          I could have just HIT you, I
          didn't, I demand respect for that.
          Since this is not a HIT, consider
          it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly
          Vipers, we will observe Viper rules
          of honor. One on one - no help - no
          bushwhackin - no treacherous
          weapons - on weapon of choice - our
          skill and our bodies.

Vernita says her name;



                      VERNITA
          *(BLEEP)*

                    THE BRIDE
          - I'm not through telling you.
          Failure to keep our date, or
          duplicity of any kind, will result
          in me putting a xoxo hollow point
          bullet into the back of your skull
          from a window of a building across
          the street from Nikki's elementary
          school. Now, feel free to respond.



                    VERNITA
          Look...I know I fucked you over. I
          fucked you over bad. I wish to God
          I hadn't, but I did.

The blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face.



                    VERNITA
          If I could go back in a machine I
          would, but I can't. All I can tell
          you is I'm a different person now.



                    THE BRIDE
          I don't care.



                    VERNITA
          Be that as it may, I know I do not
          deserve mercy or forgiveness.
          However, I beseech you for both on
          behalf of my daughter.



                    THE BRIDE
          -- Bitch, you can stop right there.

The B-word stops Vernita short, almost like a cold-handed
slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as
well).



                    THE BRIDE
              (leans in close)
          Just because I have no wish to
          murder you before the eyes of your
          daughter, does not mean parading
          her around in front of me is going
          to inspire sympathy. You and I have
          unfinished business.

          And not    a goddamn fuckin thing
          you've    done in the subsequent five
          years -    including getting knocked
          up - is    going to change that.



                    VERNITA
          You have every right to wanna get
          even --



                    THE BRIDE
          -- But that's where you're wrong,
          Vernita. I don't want to get even.
          To get even, even Steven. I would
          have to kill you, go into Nikki's
          room, kill her, then wait for your
          old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and
          kill him. That would make us even.
          No, my unborn daughter will just
          hafta be satisfied with your death
          at her mother's hands.

Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.



                    VERNITA
          When do we do this?



                     THE BRIDE
          It all depends... When do you want
          to die? Tomorrow? The day after
          tomorrow? That's about as long as
          I'll wait.



                    VERNITA
          How bout tonight, bitch?



                    THE BRIDE
          Spendid. Where?



                    VERNITA
          There's a baseball diamond where
          our little league has its games,
          about a mile from here. We meet
          there around two-thirty in the
          morning, dressed all in black, your
          hair in a black stocking, and we
          have us a knife fight, we won't be

          bothered. I have to fix Nikki's
          cereal.

As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl
for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill said you were one of the best
          ladies he'd ever seen with an edged
          weapon.

Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a
box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom."



                    VERNITA
          Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't
          qualify it, so you can just kiss my
          motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.
              (snorts to herself)
          Black Mamba, I shoulda been
          motherfuckin Black Mamba.

As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand
inside the cereal box.



                    THE BRIDE
          Weapon of choice? And if you want
          to stick with your butcher knife,
          I'm cool with that.



                    VERNITA
          Very funny.

Vernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The
Bride....

.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS
the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO
SMITHEREENS.

The Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR....

Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES
again...

...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...

...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her
back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT
INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and
the kitchen counter.

While her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to
the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's
grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH
THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel
entering Vernita's abdomen.

The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker
pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.



                       VERNITA
             Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please
             don't...



                        THE BRIDE
             Do to your daughter, what you did
             to mine...
                 (she takes her hand)
             ...I won't.

Vernita dies.

The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki
standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her
mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she
sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife
still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The
little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her
stare.

As she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already
stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL"
sewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood
off her    blade.



                       THE BRIDE
             It was not my intention to do this
             in front of you. For that I'm
             sorry. But you can take my word for
             it, your mother had it coming. When
             you grow up, if you still feel raw
             about it, I'll be waiting.

And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride
walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to
her mourning.



EXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY

The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her
vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she
makes here getaway.

She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words
"Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a
pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a
page that's headline reads;


                        DEATH LIST FIVE

On the pager are five names numbered going down the page
written in red ink.

The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink.

The second name on the list is;


                         VERNITA GREEN
                             COBRA

The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through
Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of
the residential district.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

one, she's in her hospital room; two, she's alone; three,
it's night; and four, one hellva RAINSTORM is pounding
outside.

blonde in a white nurse's uniform, with a matching white eye

She walks down the corridor towards The sleeping Bride's

INT. THE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The Bride, alone in her bed, alone in her coma, alone in her
room.

Elle Driver opens the door to her room and steps inside.
The female assassin approaches the comatose woman.

EX CU ELLE DRIVER'S EYE AND WHITE EYE PATCH
looking down at her sleeping target, victim, rival, and
opposite number.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES
wide open - blank stare.

Elle standing over The Bride's hospital bed, says to her;



                    ELLE
          I might never of liked you. Point
          in fact I despise you. But that
          doesn't suggest I don't respect
          you. You were a master of a
          profession that's most difficult to
          master.
          Dying in our sleep is a luxury our
          kind is rarely afforded. My gift to
          you.

As she lifts the syringe off the tray....

Her cell phone RINGS....

She curses to herself...there can be only one person on the
other end....she answers it.



                    ELLE
          Hello, Bill.

              (pause)
          What!

The female assassin turns away from the wide-eyed stare of
The Bride, and paces the hospital room talking in the cell
phone.

          Don't fuckin ssshhh me! If you

          You don't owe her Shit!!
              (then again, but quieter)
          You don't owe her shit.
              (pause)
          Man, fuck that bitch!
              (pause)
          Oh you're not are you? Well Bill,
          you never leave a job half done.
          A great teacher taught me that
          once, he looked a whole lot like

          you.

Elle pauses as Bill on the other line has his say. We don't
hear his side, we stay with Elle as he talks. We can tell by
her face, he's making some sense. After awhile she answers
back;



                    ELLE
          I guess.
              (pause)
          No, I don't need to guess, I know.
              (pause)
          Affirmative.
              (pause)
          I love you too, bye bye.

The female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at The
comatose Bride with the open eyes. Even though her face is
expressionless, she almost seems to be smiling.



                    ELLE
          Thought that was pretty funny
          didn't ya? Word of advice shithead,
          don't you ever wake up.

Elle leans closer to the Bride's face.



                    ELLE
          Ya know now I get a better look at
          you, you're not so damn pretty.
          Yeah, you go that Venus thing going
          for you but...ya know, now I get a
          closer look at you you're kinda
          weird looking. You got this big
          nose that doesn't fit with the rest
          of your face, your eyes are two
          different sizes. And look at your
          skin...My complexion is way better
          than yours --

The Bride does one of her motor reflex functions...She SPITS
in Elle's face.

Elle springs up, wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down
at The comatose Bride in her bed.



                    ELLE
          Oh, no you didn't.

She grabs The Bride by the front of her hospital gown...

....Yanks Her up to a sitting position...

...And PUNCHES her hard in the face three times.



                    ELLE
          If you ever take your ass out of
          this Goddamn bed for as long as you
          fuckin live, I will beat you into
          the ground, bitch!



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Elle Driver in her nurse's uniform, angrily walks down the
hallway. She passes by a DOCTOR, STRUGGLING WITH A PATIENT
BLEEDING PROFUSELY on a gurney.



                    DOCTOR
              (yelling)
          Nurse come here quick, we're losing
          this man!

Elle doesn't even look back.



                    ELLE
          Tough titty, I quit.

She walks out of the SHOT.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

INT. THE COMATOSE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA is in a corner of the ceiling, looking down on the
comatose Bride, who lies motionless in her bed.

WE HEAR the sound of a BUZZING MOSQUITO, doing loop de loops
and figure eights in the air, looking for some warm blood.

The BUZZING stops....

MACRO CU
of mosquito on The Bride's forearm, its stinger dug in her
flesh, visibly drawing blood from its host.

CU MOSQUITO'S FACE
drinking her blood.

MACROSHOT OF MOSQUITO ON FOREARM
drinking blood...when The Bride's hand comes into FRAME and
SQUASHES the bug flat. Her fingers FLICK the dead bug away.

CU The Bride
her wide-open eyes, that have stared in a constant gaze for
the last five years,
finally...slowly...softly...shut.

BEAT

They SUDDENLY POP OPEN.

The BRIDE SITS BOLD UPRIGHT IN BED.
She has no idea where the fuck she is. WE DO A SHAW BROTHERS
STYLE QUICK ZOOM INTO A CU OF HER FACE.

QUICK CUT TO A FLASHBACK SPAGHETTI-WESTERN STYLE
back at the wedding chapel, gun pointed down at our face.

THE BARREL EXPLODES LEAT AT US - BANG!

QUICK CUT BACK TO The BRIDE IN HER HOSPITAL BED,
BANK still echoing in her ears. She lets out a SCREAM OF PAIN
and her hand goes to the side of her head, as if she were
just shot.

Her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her
skull where the hole was. She knocks against it with her
knuckle...it goes...TINK...TINK.

Suddenly she says out loud;



                      THE BRIDE
          My baby.

Her hand goes down to her belly, unly to find it not swollen
but flat. She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown
and sees a JAGGED SCAR which runs down her abdomen. Her
fingertips trace it.

She quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the
lines.

MACRO CU The LINES IN HER PALM look like a road map.

She stops counting, shocked;



                      THE BRIDE

              (to herself)
          Five years.

She counts again.



                    THE BRIDE
              (a statement)
          Five years.

The Bride's two eyes fill with tears as she realizes her baby
is long gone.

WHEN SUDDENLY...

She hears the STEP...STEP...STEP...OF BILL'S BOOTS WALKING
TOWARDS HER ROOM....

WE SEE THE CINEMATIC EQUIVALENT OF A COMIC BOOK THOUGHT
BALLOON by her head. INSIDE OF IT WE SEE BILL'S BLACK BOOTS
walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel.



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (THE BRIDE'S FLOOR) - NIGHT

We see a HOSPITAL ORDERLY'S bright red and white Reeboks
softly slapping against the smooth surface of the
institution's floor. They make a sound nothing like Bill's
shoes.

                   SCREEN GOES TO SPLIT SCREEN

          LEFT SIDE                       RIGHT SIDE
The BRIDE listening to them            Orderly's Reeboks walking
getting closer. WE HEAR the            down the hospital
STEP...STEP...STEP...in time           corridor.
with Orderly's sneakers.

                                       CAMERA MOVES UP TO
                                       Orderly's face, leading
                                       two TRUCKDRIVERS.
The Bride HEARS BILL'S
VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY;


       BILL'S VOICE                            ORDERLY
      (in time)                              (in time)
   She's right in here.                She's right in here.


                      SPLIT SCREEN FINISHES
                   STAY WITH The BRIDE'S SCREEN

The Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets
her bearings, is to play possum.    She throws    herself back down
on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room.
They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in
her bed in her coma.

She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare.
Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of
her, creates a slightly different effect.

The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for
what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when
The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE
BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY.

The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her
hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind
of a "TA-DA" presentation of her vagina.



                    THE ORDERLY
          Now is that the cutest little
          blonde pussy you ever saw, or is
          that the cutest little blonde
          pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW?

Trucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren)
fronts.



                    WARREN
          I seen better.

CU The BRIDE
EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being
exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her
trying-to-be expressionless face, "I've seen a fuck load
better than you, fatass."



                    THE ORDERLY
          Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I
          know damn well this is the best
          pussy you ever saw you had touchin
          rights to. The price is seventy
          five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you
          gittin your freak on or what?

The Truckers pay the bill of fare.

As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the
rules;



                    THE ORDERLY
          Here's the rules; Rule    number one;
          no punchin 'er.
          Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got
          'er a shiner - or less    some teeth,
          jig's up. So no knuckle    sandwiches
          under no circumstances.    And by the

          way, this little cunt's a spitter -
          it's a motor reflex thing but spit
          or no, no punchin. Now are we
          absolutely positively clear about
          rule number one?



                    TWO TRUCKERS
          Yeah.



                    THE ORDERLY
          Rule number two;
          No monkey bites, no hickeys - in
          fact no leavin no marks of no kind.
          But after that, it's allll goooood.
          Her plummin down there don't work
          no more, so feel free to cum in 'er
          all ya wont. Keep the noise down -
          try not to make a mess, and I'll be
          back in twenty.

The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and
turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline
in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren.



                     THE ORDERLY
          Oh by the way, not all the time,
          but sometimes this cunt's cunt can
          get drier than a bucket of sand.
          If she dry, lube up with this and
          you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT,
          gentlemen.

And with that, The Orderly's gone.

The BRIDE'S POV:
As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren
begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly.
While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV
BLINKS.



                    GERALD
          Hey Warren, she just blinked.



                    WARREN
          He said she can't blink.



                    GERALD
          I know what he said, I'm tellin ya

          she just did.

Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles.



                    WARREN
          Just wait, when I get through with
          this little dumbbell, she gonna
          stand up and recite the Gettysburg
          Ad-dress.

Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride.
Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald.



                    WARREN
          Hey, Gerald.



                    GERALD
          Yeah?



                    WARREN
          This shit ain't no peep show. Go
          out in the hall and I'll let ya
          know when it's your turn.



                    GERALD
          Awww c'mon, I gotta leave the room?



                    WARREN
          I can't get no errection wit you
          lookin at me, so go on.



                    GERALD
          Well, just hurry up then.

Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway.



INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT

Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door.

THEN...

He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE
A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says;

                    GERALD
          He man, keep it down in there, I
          can hear your ass out here.

More falsetto SCREAMS behind the door...

THEN...

The HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected.



INT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His
buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The
Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma.

He moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose
Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the
front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the
I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT
AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into
scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE.
She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor.

The BRIDE
upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last
five years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the
bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and
tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE
CRASH BELOW FRAME.

The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work.
Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning
top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl
to do?



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out.

BACK TO The BRIDE
She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room...
STEP...STEP...STEP...

She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached
to his belt. Her hands removes it.

The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red
Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor.

CU The BRIDE
She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU.

The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.

The ORDERLY'S POV:
He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead
Truckers on the floor, and no Bride.



                       ORDERLY
          Oh shit!

WE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past
shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE
The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his
ankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He
steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and
SLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons.

The STANDING ORDERLY
lets out a "YELP," adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

IMPACT CUT
The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned.

The BRIDE (Confined to the floor)
crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor,
placing his melon head between the door and the door frame.
Then taking the door in her right hand.

                                 SLAM!

                                 SLAM!

                                 SLAM!

SLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR
FRAME.

The ORDERLY
lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in
both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind,
since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at
The comatose Bride asking him questions.



                    THE BRIDE
          Where's Bill?



                       THE ORDERLY
                 (hurt and confused)
          Who?

                                 SLAM!

He screams.

                    THE BRIDE
          Bill! Where is Bill!



                    THE ORDERLY
          I dunno no Bill.

                           SLAM!



                    THE BRIDE
          I saw him here myself.....
              SLAM!
          ....Now do you tell me where he is,
          or do I beat your fuckin brains in?

                           SLAM!



                    THE ORDERLY
          Please please stop, don't hit me
          again!



                    THE BRIDE
          Where is Bill?

                           SLAM!

Suddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck,
that she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill. She snatches it
from around his neck.



                    THE BRIDE
          Where did you get this from?



                    THE ORDERLY
          That's mine.

                           SLAM!



                    THE BRIDE
          Bullshit! I saw Bill wearing it in
          this room ten minutes ago.

                           SLAM!

Then The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the
Orderly's hand - one spelling "B.U.C.K." on each finger of

his left hand. And another spelling "F.U.C.K." on the fingers
of his right.

The Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she
does this A SPECIAL THEME MUSIC WILL PLAY (We'll call it her
REMEMBERING THEME).

WE DO A    QUICK SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM INTO HER EYES -
We see    Buck enter her room that first night, five years
ago....    He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights
you use    in a tent when camping. -- It gives off a soft blue
light.    Buck examines The Bride through the blue.



                       BUCK
             Well, ain't you the slice of cutie
             pie they all said you wuz. Well
             Ma'am, I'm from Longview Texas, my
             name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.

He starts to unbuckle his belt.

WE ZOOM OUT OF HER EYES INTO A CU. The REMEMBERING THEME CUTS
OFF. She looks down at Buck and says;



                       THE BRIDE
             Your name's Buck, right? And you
             came to fuck, right?

A "how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face.

The Bride looks down at him....The VENGEANCE THEME BEGINS
PLAYING LOUDLY ON The SOUNDTRACK, and the VEIN IN HER
FOREHEAD BECOMES PRONOUNCED and begins to PULSATE IN TIME
WITH The MUSIC. Every time The Bride comes face to face with
a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid
movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic
anticipation of the carnage to come...

...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this
Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land.

She searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown
wallet that says on it, "BIG    EL PASO    PIMPIN," loaded with
lettuce. She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup
truck key chain that has the    words,    "Pussy Wagon" on it
written in a pimpy font. She    gathers    up all these items, and
Gerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly
uniform.



INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot
open, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a
wheelchair.

She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her
arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars,
looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops.

What made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4
hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side,
and the words, "PUSSY WAGON," written along the flat-bed
hatch door. Pimpy font.

The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand.

EX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns.

EX CU TRUCK DOOR LOCK POPS UP OPEN.



INT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup
truck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away.

It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES.

Now The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat.
Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's
still stuck hiding in the hospital.    And until she regains
full use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin
anywhere or doin anything.

Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the
door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her,
her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky,
the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her
strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO HER FACE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO FACE.



                    THE BRIDE
              (monotone)
          Wiggle your big toe.

Toe doesn't move an inch.



                    THE BRIDE
          Wiggle your big toe.

It doesn't move.

                          THE BRIDE
                Wiggle your big toe.
                    (VOICE OVER)
                As I lay in the back of Buck's
                pickup truck, trying to will my
                limbs out of entropy, I could see
                the faces of the cunts who did this
                to me, and the dick responsible.
                Members all of Bill's brainchild;
                "The Deadly Viper Assassination
                Squad."

WE MOVE INTO A HEAD and SHOULDERS CU OF The BRIDE'S BLACK
SILHOUETTE.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Now after five years of beauty
          sleep I knew absolutely nothing
          about my enemies' strengths
          weakness or whereabouts. But as
          fated by God vengeance would have
          it, I who knew nothing - knew one
          thing. As sure as God made little
          green apples...

WE MOVE FAST TO O-REN ISHII'S SILHOUETTE, The SILHOUETTE
BECOMES A POSED PICTURE OF O-REN in all her Deadly Viper
glory.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
              (continued)
          ....if O-Ren Ishii, the first name
          on my Death List, was still
          alive... she'd live in Japan. O-Ren
          Ishii, made her first acquaintance
          with death at the age of eleven.

FLASH ON
CU O-REN (11-years old), hiding under a bed, watching...

...her FATHER (dressed in the uniform of a sergeant for the
American Army) fighting THREE YAKUZA GANGSTERS. He kills one
with his bare hands. The other two slice him to death with
samurai swords...

...and her MOTHER being raped by the same men. When they
finish, they SHOOT her.

Little O-Ren watches, hidden from sight, withi the eyes and
face of a stone.



                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             It was at that age, a half-Chinese,
             half-Japanese American Army brat
             witnessed the murder of her Master
             Sergeant father. And the rape, then
             murder of her mother at the hands
             of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza
             boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore
             revenge...luckily for her, Boss
             Matsumoto was a pedophile.

SHOCK CUT
O-REN ON TOP OF BOSS MATSUMOTO PLUNGING A HUGE KNIFE INTO HIS
CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a
geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl
uniform.



                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             At thirteen, she got her revenge.

The Boss's screams cause TWO OF BOSS'S MEN to run into the
room, only to be SHOT DOWN by O-Ren, as she removes a gun
from a holster strapped to her thigh.

The 20-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
on a rooftop with a high-powered, scope-sight rifle up to her
eye. Her EYE is HUGELY MAGNIFIED in the SCOPE.



                       THE BRIDE
             By twenty, she was one of the tip
             top of female assassins in the
             world.

She fires.



INT. CAR - DAY

A Central American General riding backseat    of his government
vehicle. TWO BEAUTIFUL LATIN WOMEN in one-   piece bathing suits
sit on either side of him. They both wear    sashes down their
front; one reads, "Miss Panama," the other    reads, "Miss
Venezuela." As we cut to this shot, he has    both hands on each
of their bare knees. He's laughing as the    TOP OF HIS HEAD is
BLOWN OFF.

The 23-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
stands before Bill and The Bride. (Bill is not clearly
viewed.)



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At twenty-three she joined Bill's
          Deadly Vipers...

The 25-YEAR-OLD O-REN ISHII
BEATING UP the pregnant Bride with the other Vipers...



                     THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At twenty five she did her part in
          the killing of eight innocent
          people, including my unborn
          daughter, in a small wedding chapel
          in El Paso Texas. But on that day,
          five years ago, she made one big
          mistake...

POSED FIGURE of the BRIDE in all her pre-beating bridal gown
glory.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          ...she Should of killed nine.
          However, before statisfaction would
          be mine, first things first...

FADE UP ON



INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Pavement of the parking lot. We HEAR a CAR DOOR OPEN
OFFSCREEN, then The Bride's bare foot comes from above FRAME,
stepping down INTO The SHOT.

She walks around to the driver's side and climbs in.

She sticks Buck's ignition key in its slot and turns.

The truck's engine RUMBLES to life.

She spies a pair of Elvis T.C.B. SUNGLASSES lying on the
dash. She puts them on.



EXT. TEXAS STREETS/ INT. TEXAS STORES - DAY

The Bride drives Buck's big, yellow pussy wagon all over El
Paso buying supplies.

WE FOLLOW Her bare feet into a clothing store.

Her feet, legs, and ass slip into a new pair of LEVI'S.

Her hands grab a pair of CHERRY BROWN COWBOY BOOTS.

Then slips on the cowboy boots.

Chooses another TOP.

And finds a warm JACKET.

She opens Buck's "BIG EL PASO PIMPIN" wallet, and pays for
the items.

She emerges from the store wearing her new outfit, and climbs
back in the truck.

She drives, stopping at a DEPARTMENT STORE, and walking
inside.

She picks up a SHOVEL, a HAND PICKAXE, a big CAMPING
FLASHLIGHT, a MAP OF TEXAS, a writing NOTEBOOK, and a bunch

of RED and BLACK FELT PENS.

While the Bride is buying items in the department store we'll
CROSSCUT....

....with her driving the pussy wagon up to a low-rent motel
called, "The Texican"....

...Her Registering with the OLD BASTARD of a desk clerk,
getting the key, and paying him out of the "BIG EL PASO
PIMPIN" wallet....

...her drawing a bath in the bathroom of the motel room...

Shampoo is taken off the shelf of the department store...

...conditioner...

...a bar of soap...

...hot water runs out of the bathtub faucet...

...steam rises off the hot bathwater...

...she pulls down a bunch of bath products, like bubble bath,
salts, apricot this - kiwi that, we see her pour all the
items in the bathwater...

...then we see her bare foot enter the bathwater...

...then Lower her whole body into the bathwater...

...now submerged in the warm bathwater, by herself, perfect
MUSIC CUE ON SOUNDTRACK, she begins to cry...her poor heart
has been shattered and five years of tears come flooding out
of her.

She cries for her baby...

She cries for the motherhood robbed from her...

She cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel,
who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her
path...

She cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover...

She cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades...

She cries for the five years of life snatched from her...

She cries for the countless violations she endured while
incapacitated...

And finally, she cries for all the misery she will cause the
undeserving......enroute to Bill's retribution. Retribution
that begins the minute she steps out of this bathtub.

She curls up into a fetal position inside the tub of warm
water...weeping.

We DOLLY back...to give our heroine some privacy...WE
DISSOLVE through the bathroom door...Till we're on the other
side, filming a closed door with crying on the other side.

When she's finished shedding tears, is when she'll begin
shedding blood.

When the bathroom door opens, the woman that emerges, has
closed out all of her emotions...save from one...revenge.

It's that woman, in her new outfit, that climbs into the
yellow pussy wagon, puts the T.C.B. Sunglasses over her eyes,
and starts the engine that sets into motion the gory story to
follow.

EXT./INT. BUCK'S TRUCK DRIVING IN DESERT (MOVING) - NIGHT

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:
The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of
prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil
derrick pumping up and down.

The Bride STOPS the truck.

Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the
headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular.

She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside.

She    smiles.    If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken
it    as a sign    that her vengeance quest was never meant to be.
But    as it is    there, it would appear that fortune has smiled
on    The Bride    and her bloody intentions.

She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand
pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and
CHANGES THE MUSIC TO A POUNDING HEAVY METAL ANTHEM.

CU The BRIDE'S COWBOY BOOTS
next to the X ROCK
IN TIME WITH The METAL, The Bride's cowboy boots count out
ten paces from the rock.
When the boots stop, the flashlight ENTERS THE SHOT
illuminating the spot, THEN...the shovel ENTERS, striking
deep in the unmarked earth.



EXT. TEXAS DESERT - NIGHT

Deep in the middle of Fuck-Knows Texas, lit by the headlights
of Buck's 4x4, The Bride digs a hole in the
ground......TILL...

She HITS SOMETHING HARD.

She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the
hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is
revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth.

She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army
footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in
the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open,
she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the
rim.

Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the
department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of
her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag.

We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one.

The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

pieces is a HIGH-POWERED, SCOPE-SIGHT RIFLE.

1 MANILA ENVELOPE.
She reaches in and pulls out a PHOTOCOPY OF HER SONOGRAM.
There on the page is a photocopy of her unborn baby girl. A
fierce grimness crosses her face as she places the sonogram
back in the envelope.

1 CLEAR ZIP-LOCK BAG containing a PHONY I.D. and BANK BOOK
both w/ the name "CANDY RALSTON" on them. Reaching back in
the locker she pulls out the final item,

1 SMALL KEY attached to a "DEALY VIPERS" KEY CHAIN.

She rolls up the weapons in the sleeping bag, and drives off.
The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES...

bank, all the weapons she needs, all the money she needs,
taking the first step on her bloody trail...

The ENTRANCE to a tiny sushi bar, covered by a Japanese
curtain....

                           "The City of
                         OKINAWA, JAPAN"

....The fabric is moved aside, and The Bride enters the shot,
and the tiny establishment.

The little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word
cozy. Besides The Bride, the only other person inside is The
SUSHI CHEF, who smiles at her behind the midget bar.

This Japanese man in his mid-fifties greets the tall, blonde
western girl with a turned-on-for-the-tourists affability.



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          English?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Almost -- American.



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

          Ahhhh,...America, welcome...
          Welcome... My English -- Very good.

The Bride smiles at this and walks further inside. She
doesn't come across as one of the world's deadliest
assassins, but instead as a sweet, slightly airheaded,
American tourist.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Domo.

The Sushi Chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise, and
says;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Oh, "Domo", Very good -- very good,
          you speak Japanese?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Nooo, just a few words I learned
          since yesterday. - May I sit at the
          bar?



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Sure sure sure - sit. What other
          words did you learn - excuse me --

The Sushi Chef YELLS IN JAPANESE, to someone OFFSCREEN.

The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to
imagine there could be a back room to it.

Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling
to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          -- What other Japanese you learn?

The Bride puts on a thinking face.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Oh...let's see..."Arigato."



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          "Arigato"...Very good.

                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          ..."Ah-So"...



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          "Ah-So!" You know what "Ah-So"
          meansß



                     THE BRIDE
          "I See."



                    SUSHI CHEF
          I see - Very good.



                    THE BRIDE
          I already said "Domo", right?



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Yes.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          "Kon-netie-wa."

The Sushi Chef goes "Oooh" like he's just discovered the
answer to a mystery.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          ..."Kon-nichi-wa"...repeat please.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          "Kon-nichi-wa?"

Saying with surprise and admiration;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Most impressive...you say Japanese
          words, like you Japanese.

The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle.

                    THE BRIDE
          Now you're making fun of me.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          No no no - serious business.
          Pronunciation - very good. You say
          "Arigato" ...like we say "Arigato."



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Well, thank you - I mean...arigato.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          You should learn Japanese - very
          easy.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          No kidding, I heard it's kinda
          hard.

Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or
understand you, he yells the word;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What!

And everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately
afterwards.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I always heard it was difficult.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Yes yes yes - most difficult. But
          you have Japanese tongue.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Maybe I was Japanese in another
          life.

The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know;

                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Most definitely, most definitely
             Japanese in another life.

He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young
blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful.



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             How did you know tuna's my
             favorite?



                         SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             What!



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             Tuna's my favorite.



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Ah, thank you very much.

He YELLS    OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE
MAN with    a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He
heads for    the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in
Japanese,    "What she wants to drink?"



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
                 (to the bald man)
             I beg your pardon?

The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking.



                         SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             - Drink -



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake.



                        SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Ahhh sake,
                 (he holds up his thumb)
             Very good.

In Japanese he YELLS/ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald
Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish.

                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          First time in Japan?



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          A-huh.



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What!



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Yes, this is my first time.

As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he
asks;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What brings you to Okinawa?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I came to see a man.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Aaahh, you have friend live in
          Okinawa?



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Not quite.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Not friend?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I've never met him.

The Sushi Chef continues slicing.....



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

          Who is he, may I ask?



                    THE BRIDE
          Hattori Hanzo.

There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he
brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth.

The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he
pours one for The Bride, then disappears again.

As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef.

As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride.

The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that
point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks;



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          What do you want with Hattori
          Hanzo?

The Bride answers in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I need Japanese steel.



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          Why do you need Japanese steel?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I have vermin to kill.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          You must have big rats you need
          Hattori Hanzo steel.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Huge.



INT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY

The trap door in the floor opens up, and HATTORI HANZO (Sushi
Chef), climbs inside the room, followed by The Bride.

The room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand-carved
wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of
the second half of the attic.

The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel, looking and
touching the shiny wood. She looks behind her to Hanzo who is
still by the trap door, and says;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          May I?

The Sushi Chef answers in ENGLISH;



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Yes you may.....

She starts reaching for one...



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          ...try the second one down in the
          sixth row on your left.

She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath.

Her hand lifts it from the rack.

She UNSHEATHS the steel, partially....then with GREAT
FLOURISH....completely.

Hanzo's mouth froms a smile.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Funny, you like samurai swords...

He pulls a baseball out of his pocket.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          ...I like baseball.

THEN SUDDENLY - HE THROWS THE BASEBALL HARD, right at The
Bride's head....

QUICK AS A WHIP, SHE SLICES THE BALL IN HALF, IN MID AIR.

The two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor.

He gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards
her.

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          I wanted to show you these....
          However someone as you, who knows
          so much must surely know, I no
          longer make instruments of death. I
          keep these here for their ascetic
          and sentimental value.
              (he takes both sword and
               sheath from her...)
          Yet proud tho I am of my life's
          work...
              (...he closes them
               together)
          I am retired.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Then give me one of these.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          These are not for sale.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I didn't say, sell me. I said, give
          me.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          And why should I be obliged to
          assist you in the extermination of
          your vermin?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Because my vermin, is a former
          student of yours. And considering
          the student, I'd say you had a
          rather large obligation.

Hattori Hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name,
"BILL" on it with his finger.

The blonde girl nods her head yes.

The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor,
throwing it open.

He points into a corner...

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...You can sleep there...

.....starts to descend....



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...it will take me a week to make
          the sword...

.....before his head disappears, he says;



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...I suggest you spend it
          practicing.

...he closes the door behind him.

She smiles slightly...then moves over to the window, takes
out a handkerchief, and wipes Bill's name off.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.



OVER BLACK
TITLE APPEARS:


                        "One week later"

Under black we hear Hattori Hanzo's voice in Japanese and
read the subtitles;



                    HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
          I'm done doing what I swore an oath
          to God 28 years ago to never do
          again. I've created, "something
          that kills people." And in that
          purpose I was a success.

                                                FADE UP ON



CU HATTORI HANZO



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          I've done this, because
          philosophically I'm sympathetic to
          your aim.

EX CU The HANZO SWORD

TRACKING EX CU of the Hanzo sword in its shiny, black wood
sheath. At the base of the sheath, by the handle, he's carved
the face of a lioness...



                      HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
            I can tell you with no ego, this is
            my finest sword. If on your
            journey, you should encounter God,
            God will be cut.

CU HANZO.



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            Revenge is never a straight line.
            It's a forest. And like a forest
            it's easy to lose your way...to get
            lost...
            to forget where you came in. To
            serve as a compass, a combat
            philosophy must be adopted that can
            be found in the secret doctrine of
            the Yagu Ninja. And now my yellow
            haired warrior, repeat after me;

We go back and forth between CU of HANZO reciting the
doctrine like a samurai drill instructor and the Bride
repeating it.



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            "When engaged in combat, the
            vanquishing of thine enemy can be
            the warrior's only concern...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            ...This is the first and cardinal
            rule of combat...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            ...Suppress all human emotion and
            compassion...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)

          ...Kill whoever stands in thy way,
          even if that be Lord God, or Buddha
          himself...

The Bride repeats this...



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          This truth lies at the heart of the
          art of combat. Once it is
          mastered... Thou shall fear no
          one... Though the devil himself may
          bar thy way...

The Bride repeats this... Her eyes look at the greatest maker
of swords on this earth and says;



                       THE BRIDE
          Domo.

EX CU The Hanzo Sword,
her white hand with her long fingers COMES INTO FRAME and
removes the beautiful, artful instrument of vengeance.

                                              FADE TO BLACK.

A BLANK PIECE    OF DRAWING PAPER
A hand comes    in and, as the Bride talks over this image,
draws with a    piece of charcoal, a portrait of the geisha
regaled O-REN    ISHII.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          When fortune smiles on something as
          violent and ugly as revenge, at the
          time it seems proof like no other,
          that not only does God exist,
          you're doing his will. At a time
          when I knew the last about my
          enemies, the first name on my death
          list, was the easiest to find. But

          of course,    when one manages the
          difficult    task of becoming queen of
          the Tokyo    underworld, one doesn't
          keep it a    secret, does one?

The charcoal drawing gets color and becomes ANIMATED, turning
into a JAPAMATION O-REN...

JAPANESE ANIMATION SEQUENCE
We see Japamation-style images of The Bride's verbiage.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At the age of twenty, Bill backed
          his Nippon progeny financially and
          philosophically in her
          Shakespearian-in-magnitude power
          struggle with the other Yakuza
          clans, over who would rule vice in
          the city of Tokyo.

Japamation images of O-Ren and her Army, taking on ANOTHER
YAKUZA ARMY, among falling cherry blossoms.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH between cartoon images of this and the
real life real McCoy samurai sword battle.

O-Ren's ability is simply amazing.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          When it was all over, it was the
          geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that
          proved the victor.



INT. JAPANESE NIGHT CLUB

O-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the
city of Tokyo. The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with TWO
BODYGUARDS standing behind them, toast their new leader, with
much laughter and drinking...all except one...BOSS TANAKA.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          And just in case you're wondering
          how could a half breed Japanese
          Chinese American become the boss of
          all criminal activity in Tokyo,
          Japan,... I'll tell you. The
          subject of O-Ren's blood and
          nationality came up before the
          council only once. The night O-Ren
          assumed power over the crime
          council.

Boss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the
alcohol-fueled frivolity.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          The man who seems bound and
          determined to break the mood is
          Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka
          thinks is...

Boss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the
plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces.

The party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the
Tanaka Crime Family.



                    CRIME FAMILY LEADER #2 (JAPANESE)
          Tanaka? What's the meaning of this
          outburst? This is a time for
          celebration.



                    BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
          And what exactly should I be
          celebrating? The perversion of our
          illustrious council?

The Bosses all react with shock and outrage...O-Ren remains
cool. She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it
for the rest of the sentence.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously
          has something on his mind. Allow
          him to express it.



                    BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
          My father...
              (looking at a clan head)
          ...along with yours and...
              (looking at another)
          ...along With yours, started this
          council. And while you drink like
          fish and laugh like donkeys, they
          weep in the afterlife over the
          perversion committed today.

The BOSSES react again...O-Ren;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)

           Silence!
               (then composed)
           Of what perversion do you speak,
           Tanaka?

Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says;



                     BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
           I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the
           perversion done to this council,
           which I love more than my own
           children,...by making a half
           Chinese American its leader.

Then...

Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,...

O-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed...

Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body...

The head hits the floor...

And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of
blood shoots up in the air.

The BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more
flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse.

The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to
their swords and draw them.

O-Ren turns her blade in their direction.

The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch.

The lady looks across at the two men and says in and
authoritative voice;



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Fight me or work for me.

They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Drop them on the ground.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Get behind me.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Get on your knees.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Put your foreheads on the floor.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Keep your mouths shut.

You better believe they do.

The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her.

As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for
their bosses.



                     O-REN
           I'm going to say this in English so
           you know how serious I am. As your
           leader, I encourage you to -- from
           time to time and always in a
           respectful manner, and with the
           complete knowledge that my decision
           is final -- to question my logic.
           If you're unconvinced a particular
           plan of action I've decided is the
           wisest, tell me so. But allow me to
           convince you. And I will promise
           you, right here and now, no subject
           will be taboo...except the subject
           that was just under discussion.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
               (to a bodyguard)
           Hand me that head.

He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen.

She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)

          The price you pay for bringing up
          either my Chinese or my American
          heritage as a negative is, I
          collect your fuckin head.
              (now completely American)
          Just like this fucker here. Now if
          any of you sonsabitches got
          anything else to say, now's the
          fuckin time.

Nobody says anything.



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          I didn't think so.
              (pause)
          Meeting adjourned.



EXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT

The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The
CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant
staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on
their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not
satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The
door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps
inside, the door is slid shut.



INT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT

The private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The
patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA
CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII.

Sitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than
O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are
dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid
skirts and matching blazers.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's)

On her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL

The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits,
white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes,
are her soldiers, "The CRAZY 88."

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move
blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way.

And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans
Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL.

They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a
joke in Japanese.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          The mop tops in black suits and
          Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers,
          "The Crazy 88." The two young girls
          in the schoolgirl uniforms are her
          personal bodyguards, the Yubari
          sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go
          Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady
          who's dressed like she's a villain
          on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend
          and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And
          finally, the American in the black
          suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's
          head of security, Mr. Barrel.

SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest,
her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's
listening to The Bride's narration.

The Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE --

O-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe
and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound.

CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono
on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.
The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost
taking off the tip of her nose in the process.

INSERT: DART EMBEDS ITSELF IN A WOOD POST.

O-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a
halt. Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to
retrieve the eavesdropper.



INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The white paper door to O-Ren's dining room SLAMS OPEN. Yuki
and Go Go step into the corridor.

All trace of the Bride has vanished.

They look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal.

Whoever was there is gone now.

Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the
Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, SLAMMING
the door behind them.

ONE SHOT

CU The BRIDE
at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. She
observes all the activity by O-Ren's private dining room.
When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off
her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the
parking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door.
Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece
yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides,
like the one Bruce Lee wears in "Game of Death." She tosses
the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo
sword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her
back inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren
dining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open
the door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to
the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki
leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the
bathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce
Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.

                                                 END OF SHOT
BACK AND FORTH
between CU's of the two women, face to face.



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
               (to Bride)
           Can I help you?



                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
           Yes, I am looking for the attorney
           of O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would
           that be you?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
           I'm Mistress Ishii's attorney. How
           can I help you?

The Bride PUNCHES her in the face.



INT. O-REN'S PRIVATE ROOM

Aside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the
Tokyo underworld - Mistress O-Ren Ishii - and her private
army doing when we cut back?

Singing karaoke, of course.

It's Crazy 88 MIKI's turn at the mike and he's having a whale

of a good time singing Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," in
Japanese....

WHEN...

A COMMOTION is heard being made by the restaurant staff and
the other patrons, from the other side of the white paper
wall...Just as they all start to notice it, they hear;



                    THE BRIDE (O.S., JAPANESE)
          O-Ren Ishii! You and I have
          unfinished business!

The Crazy 88 spring to their feet. One slides open the door.

They see O-Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle
of the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand
gripped around a post. She has a terrified look on her face.
Before anybody on O-Ren's side of the room can say anything
...The Bride steps out from behind Sofie.

O-REN'S
reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned
out to be. She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's
BLEEPED OUT.

The Bride
The VENGEANCE THEME BURSTS ON THE SOUNDTRACK...The Vein on
her forehead begins to pulsate. WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS
ZOOM INTO HER EYES. A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren
beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS
SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES. The FLASHBACK DISSOLVES, we ZOOM
BACK INTO A CU, the vein stops pulsating, and the theme STOPS
PLAYING OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, LEAVING A CLEAN, COLORFUL CU of
The Bride loaded for bear.

She raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the
Shoulder with one stroke.

SOFIE
Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in
agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes
of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both
surprise and shock.

The CRAZY 88
run out into the dining area and create a human wall between
themselves and their Mistress.

MR. BARREL AND GO GO
take positions on either side of O-Ren.

O-REN
seated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)

          You bastard!

The Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's
blood flies off the blade.

The entire floor of the dining room lies between the two
warring parties.


                          The Bride
                             vs.
                         The Crazy 88

The restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in
fear.

O-Ren says loudly to the room;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Sorry everybody, but I'm afraid
          we're going to have to close the
          place. There's some private
          business that we must attend to
          now.

The Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits.

The Bride, The Crazy 88, and O-Ren hold    their ground without
moving a muscle, till the dining room,    as well as the entire
restaurant known as "The House of Blue    Leaves," is deserted
of every human not engaged in the face-   off that precedes
combat.

O-Ren gives a simple order;



                    O-REN
          Miki.

MIKI, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward,
unsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde.



                    MIKI (JAPANESE)
          You had it coming bastard!

Raising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming A
Banzai Scream...

The Bride turns to face him.

Miki Charging and Screaming...

The Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking
Position.

Miki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her.

The Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to
arrive.

Miki arrives at his destination, he Swings...

The Bride Swings...

The Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half. Miki
looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand.

The Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then
Lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air.

Miki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end
of a spear. Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in
the B.G.

O-Ren and her crew watch stunned.

The Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that
starts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge
blue splash. Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish -
Red blood - Dead man.

The BRIDE
looks up from the pond, across the length of the    floor, into
the eyes of O-Ren Ishii.
She takes one step forward, hears the slightest    noise, Twirls
the samurai sword in the air once, drops to one    knee, and
thrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-   covered
floor. The sword sticks in the floor half way...

The Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor...

OVERHEAD SHOT
Looking down on The    Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew
at the other. A Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried
in the floor...The    red circle grows larger...and larger...and
larger...and larger    still...

Leaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking
straight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee,
and straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo
underworld.

O-Ren
her eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Tear the bitch apart!

The six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same
time with a GREAT SOUND EFFECT.

They circle the Bride.

The BRIDE
Inside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her. She Whips
the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in
front of her. Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel.

Holding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see
reflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her.

The six Crazy 88 Attack...

The BRIDE
does a Zatoichi-like SWISH-SLASH-SWISH with her steel blade.

Four boys die an    immediate samurai blade-inflicted death,
SCREAMING GRUNT,    TWITCHING BODY, FROZEN IN THE STANCE IT WAS
SLASHED IN, RED    BLOOD SQUIRTING FROM WOUNDS, THEN A CRASHING
COLLAPSE TO THE    FLOOR.

The last two put up more of a fight...but then one of them is
SLASHED and FALLS and the last one is SLASHED AND CRASHES
THROUGH the restaurant's big picture window.

EX CU The EYES
of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet,

...BEAT

...they Look back up at O-Ren.

O-REN
standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow.

The BRIDE
swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead
attackers flies off.

GO GO and MR. BARREL
unsheath their swords.

WHEN...

We hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then
behind her, through the broken pictures window we see
seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the
riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry
samurai swords.

The BRIDE
looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren.

O-REN
smiles.



                     O   -REN (ENGLISH)
              (to the     Bride)
          You didn't     think it was going to be
          that easy,     did you?

                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
              (to O-Ren)
          You know, for a second there, yeah
          I did.

O-Ren smiles...



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Silly rabbit...

Both O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,...



                    O-REN/THE BRIDE
          ...Trix Are for kids.

This is something they used to say back when they fought
alongside of each other as "Vipers."

The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the
restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride.

As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE
SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western
Stand-off.

We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround
the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one
JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE
IRON over his head.

As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of
The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword
Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc...

....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point...

...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN
TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE
ON SCREEN.

As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms
flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde
hair whipping like a whirling dervish....
...She's a Goddess of War Venus.

Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The
Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights.

This explosion of furious violence is punctuated
CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the
fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning
the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO
OIL BLACK.

Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and
liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's
blade.

Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS

While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang
out of its holster, and Throws it...

....It Twirls Through the Air...

...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces.

The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an
Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's
Out.

The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over
her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air,
Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck.

She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the
vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from
its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.

While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her.
Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends
It Flying in the Charging Man's path...

...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground...

...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he
falls flat.

The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks
her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off.

...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands
off.

So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine
foot tall Bride fights with the others.

When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's
perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the
Bride back to the floor like an alevator.

As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders,
somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an
attacker's legs into his groin.

He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free.

ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, "The Best One." He
Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to,
"Come get a piece."

The Bride does a screaming charge towards him....
...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm -
steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to

collide.....They meet.....

SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN -
CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE -

They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a
mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither
clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm.

...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the
floor.

The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of
his chest.

Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain
alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still
holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker,
backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining
killers.

Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the
action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from
his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and
Crashes to the floor.

The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself
for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy
Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top.
She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and
feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped
over on its shell....

Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground.

...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of
her head, and Pops back up on her feet.

And then there were seven.

The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved
out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the
floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle.

The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor,
lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In
repose.

EX CU The Bride's eyes
pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE
FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood.

O-REN
WHIPS OPEN a red fan.

GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the
switch.

The room goes dark.

The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still
on the floor....

...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she
breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED
OVER HER FACE.

Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in
(Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) .....

The Bride rises to her feet...

The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a
circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in
rhythm with the Metal...

The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both
Music and The Bride Explode!

WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE
With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers
fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow
falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like
black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage.

The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue
backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and
death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all
sword-weilding partners.

She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They
seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then
CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or
hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each
encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride
crouches down low in repose while the others continue to
circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again.

We Cut in closer whenever we need to.

Finally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's
sword.

GO GO
Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the
lights back on. The electricity shines light on...

The BRIDE
Splashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls
and ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded
men who have yet to die, litter the ground.

With a big "Whoosh" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's
subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade.

Then saying to the foes who litter the ground.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

          Those    of you lucky enough to still
          have    your lives. Take them with
          you.    But leave the limbs you've
          lost.    They belong to me now.

The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant.

The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last
remaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren
Ishii.

Go Go
steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai
sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain.
She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a
WHOOSH sound in the air.

BALL AND CHAIN
in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us.

The BRIDE
ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk
of wood post behind her.

Go Go
eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she
lets fly...

The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo
sword...

...Go Go yanks...

...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip.

GO GO
smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

The BRIDE
removes her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go.

The BOOMERANG
TWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go.

BAM

The young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and
chain. She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on
the floor. She looks    across at her opponent...WHOOSH...
WHOOSH...WHOOSH..she    LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the
chest, knocking her    on her back...

...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the
Bride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal
ball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead.

The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its
purpose.

She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight.

Go Go hops up on a table...

As they fight they hop from table to table...

Go Go throws her ball and chain...

...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP...

BATS it away with the table leg.

Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around
the Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS...

...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL
CRASHING through another table.

Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai
short sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it.

The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly
with struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to
the Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams
as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she
rolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the
table leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER
HEAD.

The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and
delivers a powerful "C.K." to the Bride from below, dropping
her to her knees.

O-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and
begins to strangle.

The chain digs into the Bride's throat.

The Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty
looking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh.
The nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her
flesh...the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat
with them.

Go Go lets out a horrific scream.

The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young
girl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe
becomes stained with red.

Go Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the
floor.

The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins
breathing air into her lungs.

Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her...

The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's
weapon above her head.

Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second
floor...

The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the
ball and chain over her head.

Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs...
She gets to the top.

The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain...

It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari
sisters, smack DAB in the back of the head.

CU GO GO
We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind
it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit
shatter like a teapot.

Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the
staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before
the tumble began.

The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go
to the last two remaining combatants...

...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Any more subordinates for me to
          kill, O-Ren?

Mr. Barrel says;



                    MR. BARREL
          One last one.



                    THE BRIDE
          You're Mr. Barrel, right?



                    MR. BARREL
          And you're Black Mamba.



                    THE BRIDE
          Our reputations precede us.



                    MR. BARREL
          Apparently.

                    THE BRIDE
          Tell me Mr. Barrel, why don't you
          wear your Kato mask? Are you and
          iconoclast?

Mr. Barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick, like from a 17th
Century costume ball, and holds it over his eyes.



                    MR. BARREL
          I don't like that rubber band. It
          fucks up my hair.



                    THE BRIDE
          You shouldn't work for her.



                      MR. BARREL
          Too late.



                    THE BRIDE
          It's not too late to quit.



                    MR. BARREL
          Do you have choices?



                      THE BRIDE
          No.



                    MR. BARREL
          I know exactly how you feel.



                    THE BRIDE
          This has nothing to do with You and
          I, and everything to do with me
          taking satisfaction from that bitch
          behind you. And there's absolutely
          positively no way I'M going to
          leave here without taking that
          satisfaction. So Mr. Barrel, you
          have to stand aside. And that means
          you must quit, right now.

                     MR. BARREL
          I can't.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes you can.



                    MR. BARREL
          No I can't.



                    THE BRIDE
          Don't say "Can't", there are no
          "Cant's." Yes - You - Can.....

O-REN ISHII
Screams at her "...last line of defense;"



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          What are you waiting for? Are you
          on a date? Attack her you fool!



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh my God...
              (pause)
          ...She just called you a fool. She
          just called you a fool in front of
          me. Not only am I your opponent.
          I'm a female fellow countryman.
          And you're going to risk your life -
          to say nothing of harming me - for
          a woman who refers to you as a
          fool?

O-REN
is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Attack, Goddamn you!

The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she
just saw.

Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look
she's never seen from him before.

He then looks back to the Bride.

Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the
slightest hint of plea in her voice;



                      THE BRIDE
            I'll owe ya one.

He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his
sword;



                      MR. BARREL
            The things I do for a pretty face.

INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The
Handle locks into place with a Click.

He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and
says;



                      MR. BARREL (JAPANESE)
            I quit.

O-Ren fries and egg on her head.

Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left
hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn
room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel
with   the Bride, He stops and    says;



                      MR. BARREL
            About that one you owe me.



                      THE BRIDE
            Yes?



                      MR. BARREL
            I'm gonna collect someday, you
            know?



                      THE BRIDE
            I'll be disappointed if you don't.

He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the
restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's
lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says;

                    MR. BARREL
          Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.

He exits the Movie.

O-REN and The BRIDE
match eyes. The Japanese gal says;



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Very funny.
              (pause)
          Your instrument is quite
          impressive.



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Domo.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Where was it made?



                      THE BRIDE
          Okinawa.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Whom in Okinawa made you this
          steel?



                    THE BRIDE
          This is Hattori Hanzo steel.



                      O-REN (JAPANESE)
          YOU LIE!!

The Bride just smiles at her rival's response.

O-Ren's composure returns.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Swords however never get tired. I
          hope you've saved your energy. If
          you haven't, you might not last
          five minutes.
              (pause)

          Have you seen the garden in this
          establishment?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          No.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Oh, you really should. It's quite
          beautiful. Allow me.

O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire
battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the
same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white
paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING....

.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky.
A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow
falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but
Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the
doorway looking out into the white night.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          As last looks go, you could do
          worse.

The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside...

The Bride follows her...



INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT

As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance
from one another.

COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish
Flamenco Guitar.......

The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in
front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle
and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her
cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls
around her.

O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises
up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face
vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls
around her.

O-REN'S FEET
White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow
underneath them...

The BRIDE
Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers
Crunching snow underneath them...

O-REN
when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat
artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in
one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird....

....The Two Women circle each other....

They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING -
CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...

O-REN LEAPS in the air
does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her
opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing...

SLASHING The BRIDE
across her back - Spinning her around...

O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The
Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together
as the Blades become entangled...

O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that
loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into
The Bride's mouth...

Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on
her ass in a koi pond.

- The Combat Guitar Stops -

O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs;



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Silly Caucasian girl likes to play
          with samurai swords. Bill might of
          humored you, but you will find
          neither humor nor mercy at my
          blade. Now unless you intend to
          commit sepeku among the koi, stand
          up and fight. You may not be able
          to fight like a samurai, but you
          can at least die like a samurai.

The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises
out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly
to O-Ren in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Attack me. With everything you
          have.

The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with

The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They
separate...

...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like
two locomotives...

O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The
respect for the Bride's ability is transparent.

The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again...

Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers...

Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down
legs staining White Socks with Red...

They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl
with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist -
Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off.

Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate.
As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs,
leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females
have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          I apologize for ridiculing you
          earlier.



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Accepted.

They continue breathing...



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Ready?



                      O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle
each other for their final attack.

With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash
in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay...TILL...They Find
themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall...

...The Bride and O-Ren both begin Running diagonally through
the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing
to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their
Samurai hearts out...

UNTIL...

They both SWING...

...can't tell who got who...

A SCALP OF LONG, BLACK HAIR FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, landing in
the white snow.

CU O-REN ISHII
facing away from the Bride. Sword still in her hand. We see
she doesn't have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A touch of her BRAIN
is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops.
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who's regime has just
ended with one swing, stares off into space.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           That really was a Hattori Hanzo
           sword...

Her sword FALLS from her grip...in the snow by her feet.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           I always dreamed of owning one...

O-Ren FALLS to her knees, toppling forward.

Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says;



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           Did he make it for you?



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
           Yes.

The Last thing she says before she dies;



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           ...He must of liked you.

With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and
she's gone.

The BRIDE
removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing
earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the
blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list,
off her Hanzo Steel.

EX CU THE HANZO SWORD

is returned back to its sheath. The LION'S HEAD that Hanzo
carved into the wood seems pleased.

                                                  CUT TO:

The BRIDE
now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her
head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT.

SOFIE FATALE
Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her MAZDA XOXO.

The BRIDE slams the trunk, SCREEN BOES BLACK...

The MAZDA driving down the road at supersonic speed.

The BRIDE
behind the wheel wearing her crash helmet. It looks like an
insert from "GRAND PRIX."

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD
car speeding...then stopping.

BLACK SCREEN
The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her FRAMED in the
TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly
Viper syringe in her hand.

When she speaks it comes out of a VOICE BOX at the bottom of
the helmet. Turning her voice deeper and electronically
spooky. The two women speak Japanese to each other.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I've kept you alive for one reason.
          Information. Being O-Ren's lawyer,
          I take it you're familiar with
          Bill?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yes.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          In fact, I'd guesstimate, you
          worked for Bill before O-Ren, and
          that's how it is you came to work
          for O-Ren. Am I correct?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I thought so. Give me the arm you
          have left.



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Why?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I want information. Now gimme your
          arm.

Sofie offers up her remaining arm.

She injects Sofie with the gold syringe.



                    THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
          The cocktail racing    through your
          bloodstream at this    moment is
          Bill's own recipe.    He calls it "The
          Undisputed Truth."

Sofie is injected.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Okay, first things first. Where was
          the other Yubari sister? Yuki?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yuki's sick. She went home early.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Do tell? What's wrong with her?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          She has a cold.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Awwww poor baby. What do you think
          she'll do when she finds out what
          happened?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)

          She'll wail with grief.

                                               SHOCK CUT TO

YUKI YUBARI upon hearing the news of her sister's death...

She SCREAMS!

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE
          She'll drink excessively.

BACK TO YUKI
Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up.

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE
          She'll start trouble.

BACK TO YUKI
sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An OLDER JAPANESE MAN in
a business suit sits next to her at the bar...he puts the
make on her.



                    BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
          Do you like Ferraris?

Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Ferrari...Italian trash.

She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the
business suit.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Do you find me hot?

The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she
gets annoyed;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Don't laugh! Do you want to fuck
          me, yes or no?

                       BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

THEN...

He lets out a GRUNT coming from below.

We see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short
sword, and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen,
creating a big red grin across his mid-section.

TWO SHOT YUKI AND BUSINESS SUIT
Yuki focused, Business Suit penetrated...She opens him up
more...he feels every inch of the blade's progress.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          How bout now, big boy, do you still
          wish to penetrate me...

Blade cuts deeper...



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Or is it I who has penetrated you.

And with her last line, does the final disemboweling slice
that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor.

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          When she stops shedding tears,
          she'll start shedding blood.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Best guess, what will she do?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          I don't hafta guess, she'll come
          after you.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Will she ever give up?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          She won't have to. When she finds

          you, I don't know who will win. But
          what I do know is, she will find
          you.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Is she more skilled than I?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Skilled won't be the word.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Don't be coy with me, bitch. What
          would be the word?



                    SOFIE
          Crazy.

The Bride takes this in...then moves on.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Okay, now I want all the
          information on the Deadly
          Vipers,... What they've been doing
          and where I can find them.



EXT. TOKYO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The big hospital of TOKYO is located by a hill by the
highway. Sofie's MAZDA pulls off the highway to the side.

The Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the
trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the
hill....Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the
huge hospital.

                                                 CUT TO:

CU SOFIE
in a hospital environment. Bill's voice speaks to her OFF
SCREEN;



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I'm so
          sorry.

                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          Please forgive my betrayal --

He shhhh's her off screen;



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          -- no more of that. I invented that
          truth serum. Once it entered your
          bloodstream, you no longer had a
          choice.



                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          But, still --



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          -- But still -- nothing, except my
          aching heart over what she's done
          to my beautiful and brilliant
          Sofie.
              (pause)
          If you had to guess why she left
          you alive, what would be your
          guess?



                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          Guessing won't be necessary. She
          informed me.

BACK TO THE BRIDE AT THE TRUNK



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I'm allowing you to keep your
          wicked life for one reason and one
          reason only. So you can tell him,
          in person, everything that happened
          here tonight. I want him to witness
          the extent of my mercy..., by
          witnessing your deformed body. I
          want you to tell him, all the
          information you just told me. I
          want him to know what I know. I
          want him to know I want him to
          know.

Then with SUPERMAN X-RAY VISION we see through the helmet to
the Bride's face inside as she says the last line.

                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          And I want them all to know,
          they'll all soon be as dead as O
          REN.

CU of SOFIE
WE PAN to a CU of YUKI

Bill says off screen;



                    BILL (O.S.; JAPANESE)
          If O-Ren was number one, unless
          she's being tricky, Vernita Green
          will be number two.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Where is Vernita Green?



                    BILL (O.S., JAPANESE)
          Los Angeles. Vernita's in Pasadena.
          But the woman you want will hold up
          in a low budget motel, fifteen of
          twenty minutes away from stepping
          on board a plane departing LAX. If
          I had to bet...I'd say Hawthorne.

Yuki blows a pink bubble gum bubble, it pops and she says in
English;



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          California, here I come.

We hear music under this card...

MONTAGE OF YUKI coming to Los Angeles cut to music.

We see YUKI dressed in her Japanese private schoolgirl outfit
with white blouse, plaid skirt, bobby socks, blazer, and
barrettes in her hair, flying on a jet enroute to Los

nail polish.

Yuki walks through LAX.

We see her cool convertible sports car and her finger
pointing at it.

We see Yuki behind the wheel of the sports car, driving as
fast as she can through the twists and turns of the Hollywood
Hills, laughing all the way.

We see Yuki running around all over LA, Hollywood and
Disneyland taking pictures with her disposable Barbie camera.

                                    Vernita's house.

We see Yuki is dressed like         EX CU: VERNITA GREEN'S
an ice cream man, and is            name in the Bride's
selling ice cream to kids           notebook. She draws a

                           FULL SCREEN

We stay with Yuki's side as she stops across the street from
the Bride. During their face-off we only see the Bride at a
distance.

The Bride is in the b.g., back to us packing her trunk, just
about ready to make a clean getaway...

WHEN...

Yuki yells to the figure across the street.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Conigute wa!

We see the back-turned figure of the Bride slightly freeze
upon hearing the Japanese greeting. Without turning around
she says;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Conigute wa.
              (pause)
          Yuki?



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          Bingo!

THRILLER MUSIC begins on the soundtrack.

The Bride turns around to face the young avenger.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Can I help you?



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You can kill yourself.

Yuki giggles.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Taking a trip?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I was.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You still are. One way.

                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I know you feel you must avenge
          your sister. But I beg you...walk
          away.

Yuki giggles.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You call that begging? You can beg
          better than that.

Yuki giggles. Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches
on the beam.



                    YUKI    (JAPANESE)
          Can I see your    face? I've heard
          your beauty is    exquisite. I would
          like to see for    myself.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Sure.

Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face
          is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.



                    THE BRIDE
          Domo.



                    YUKI    (JAPANESE)
          Your face is so    pretty, I just want
          to put both of    my palms against
          your cheeks and    give you little
          tiny kisses.

Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          How do I look?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

          Very pretty.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You're just saying that 'cause I
          told you how pretty you are.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Yuki, you're gorgeous.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Really? Is that how you'd describe
          me to somebody if I wasn't here?
          Yuki's gorgeous?



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          You bet.

Yuki giggles.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Don't make me kill you.



                     YUKI (ENGLISH)
          Okay.

Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back
and FIRES A LOUD INTENSE VOLUME of firepower at The Bride.

The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy
wagon is demolished by the ammo.

The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her
backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of
front lawns...

Yuki chases her with machine gun fire...

The Bride LEAPS over a long hedge...disappearing Behind it.

Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the
hedge...

The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and
rolls under a Volkswagen van.

Bullet FIRE EXPLODES all around the Bride as she rolls out on
the other side. She removes her 9mm automatic and returns
fire from behind the van.

Yuki yells to her in English;



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          You think you're safe! I say; Ha!

She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth,
and slides it towards the Bride.

The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on
the asphalt towards her...

She takes off running...as the Volkswagen van EXPLODES BEHIND
HER.

She cuts through the backyard of a house -- THE CAMERA TAKING
OFF WITH HER -- over their fence, in the backyard over the
fence into another yard. She trips, falling into the other
house's swimming pool. Instead of splashing around, the Bride
swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow
end. Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool.
Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front
of the house. It's located on a cul de sac.

WHEN...

Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street.

Both women see the other.

Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of
her car as she speeds down the dead-end street.

The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on
the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and
automobiles.

When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,...

She jerks the wheel...

SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite
direction.

SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN...

SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN...

BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street.

In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back.

Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around.

She gets ready to make a third pass.

Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their
front door.

The Bride yells at them;



                     THE BRIDE
          Stay in your house and stay down on
          the floor!

Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and
drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for
her.

The Bride runs into the house she's in front of.

She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back
door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is
hiding and they block the door.

Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands
up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and
says;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Time for the rabbit to come out of
          her hole!

She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself
face down on the lawn.

The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters.

Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.

Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride
runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and
runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms.

Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand...

The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just
about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall...

WHEN...

Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg.

The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of
the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING --
blood pours out of her gunshots.

Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up
the house.

The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge.

Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the
hallway.

The Bride fires...

The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking
her through a bedroom doorway.



                    THE BRIDE
              (to herself)
          Gotcha!

Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from
the doorway into the hallway;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You fucking bitch! You shot me in
          my breast! They're not fully
          developed yet, you fucking asshole!
          Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!

The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's
giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Piss me off!

She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up
everything around the Bride.

When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;



                    THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
          Yuki, in about two    minutes there's
          going to be an army    of police here.
          So if you're gonna    kill me, now's
          the time.

From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue
powder. It gives her energy.



                    THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)
          So what's it gonna be bitch?

Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          That fucking does it!

Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the

Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her.

The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm.

The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat.

Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style.

Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at
Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off
her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs.

The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs.
She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead.

Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open...
Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her
schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her
head turns in the    direction of the Bride...

The Bride sees this and can't believe it...

They lock eyes...

...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a
deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that
builds to a scream...

She charges up the steps at the Bride.

The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty...

Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high...

The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her
ankle holster.

Yuki chargin...

The Bride cocks back the hammer...

...Yuki charging, getting closer...

The Bride FIRES

Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but
she keeps charging...

The Bride fires again...

Yuki jerks but keeps on charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised
high...

The Bride FIRES

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty...

The Bride fires, but her gun jams...

Yuki leaps on her with the knife...

They struggle for a moment...

...TILL...

...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the
side.



                       THE BRIDE
             Goddamn, what a wildcat.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT

The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a
name tag on it that reads, "B. Owens," answers the phone.



                       NURSE OWENS
             Hello.

CU The Bride
on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number
written on the back that says, "B. Owens," and her phone
number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in
a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't
see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood
planks. The moon shines into the structure.



                       THE BRIDE
             Hello, I'm calling Nurse Owens --



                       NURSE OWENS
             Who is this.



                       THE BRIDE
             You don't know me, but --



                       NURSE OWENS
             -- And I don't want to neither. Now

I don't know how you got my number,
but you can just rip that shit up,
because --



          THE BRIDE
-- I've been shot five times --



          NURSE OWENS
-- Stop, I don't wanna hear no
more. I got problems of my own.



             THE BRIDE
I'm dying.



          NURSE OWENS
Then bitch, you better call
yourself a ambulance, cause I don't
do this shit no more.



          THE BRIDE
I can't call an ambulance.



             NURSE OWENS
--    No, you can call a ambulance,
you    just don't want to. But if your
ass    is really dying, you ain't got
no    motherfuckin choice.



          THE BRIDE
I do have a choice, and I'm
choosing to call you. If you refuse
to help me, I'll die. And that will
be your choice.



          NURSE OWENS
Bitch, I don't even know you!



          THE BRIDE
What do you need to know? I'm from
Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and
only you can help me.

Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Okay, where you at?



                    THE BRIDE
          I'm in Hawthorne. I'm hiding in a
          kids treehouse. It's a street
          called, "Dimmick". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick
          Avenue. There's a bunch of police
          cars and firetrucks, about two
          blocks away.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Whatcha do, crawl two blocks?



                    THE BRIDE
          If you can't walk, you better
          crawl.

Nurse Owens likes that last line.



                    NURSE OWENS
          You got you some money dontcha, or
          am I doin this out of the goodness
          of my heart?



                    THE BRIDE
          You come and get me, today's pay
          day.



                    NURSE OWENS
          You ain't too far away. You gonna
          bleed to death I get there in a
          half a hour?



                      THE BRIDE
          Probably.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Okay, I'll be there in fifteen
          minutes.

                    THE BRIDE
          Is that Pacific Standard Time, or
          C.P.T.?



                    NURSE OWENS
          Just you better be there    when I get
          there, and you better be    shot five
          times, and your bony ass    better be
          on your last motherfuckin    legs.



                    THE BRIDE
          How do you know I have a bony ass?



                    NURSE OWENS
          You sound like you have a bony ass.

The Nurse hangs up the phone.



INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens.

Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor.



                    THE BRIDE
          Glad you made it.



                    NURSE OWENS
          There's cops all over here, I had
          to be cool. They tend to notice
          things like Negroes sneaking around
          people's backyards.

The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey.



                    THE BRIDE
          What's that?



                    NURSE OWENS
          This shit's gonna hurt, and I ain't
          got no anesthetic.

              (refers to the bottle)
          So git busy.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

OVERHEAD SHOT
The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the
nurse extracts the bullets.

The Bride screams.

The TV is turned up loud to hide the screams.

The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three
cigarette butts and other balls of lead.

The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior;



                    THE BRIDE
          That fuckin smarts.

Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says;



                    NURSE OWENS
          Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the
          future, you should avoid them if
          you can.



                    THE BRIDE
          I'll keep that in mind. So, do I
          have a future?



                    NURSE OWENS
          You'll live to kill again.



                      THE BRIDE
          Splendid.

She passes out.

                                             FADE TO BLACK.

                 "Can she bake a cherry pie."


EX CU SLOT IN DOOR
is slid open revealing two male eyes on the other side.



                       DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Yes?



                    TWO EYES (O.S.)
          I heard you had a game?



                    DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Who are you?



                    TWO EYES (O.S.)
          They call me Bill.



                       DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Bill what?



                    BILL (O.S.)
          That, no one ever calls me.

A FEMALE VOICE FROM OFF SCREEN says to the Doorman;



                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Open the door Alburt, let's see
          what this Bill looks like.

The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door,
and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into
a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of
the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their
luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.

One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of
the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE.

Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a

tux, waits for L.F.'s word.



                       L.F. O'BOYLE
             Are you a policeman, Bill?



                       BILL
             Not anymore?

L.F. laughs.



                       L.F.
             Let him play, Alburt.

Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest.



                       L.F.
                 (to the players)
             We now return to the game already
             in progress. The point is nine
             gentlemen, nine is the point...

As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five
other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai
swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his
hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the
sword;



                       ALBURT
             I'll take that.



                       BILL
             You'll have to.

The two men stare...



                       L.F.
             Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you
             intend to start any shit with that
             sword?



                       BILL
             I give you my word of honor, I will
             start nothing.

                    L.F.
          Good enough for me.
              (back to game)



                    ALBURT
          Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred
          dollar membership fee.



                    BILL
          That's rather pricey.



                    ALBURT
          You wanna play for free, go to
          Vegas. You start now you'll be
          there by sundown.

Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull
to death. He peels off two hundred.



                    BILL
          I think I'll stay here. I'm
          thirsty.



                      ALBURT
          That way.

Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it.



                      BILL
          Beer.



                    BARTENDER
          Twenty dollars.



                    BILL
          Twenty dollars for a beer?



                    BARTENDER
          High cost of living shooter. You
          don't like it, go to Vegas. You can

          get a prime rib dinner there for
          3.95.



                    BILL
          What am I going to do, I'm thirsty.
              (throws a 20 on the bar)
          Pour the beer.

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer
inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.



                    BILL
              (pointing to the can)
          I don't get that?

The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.

He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;



                    BILL
          Cheers.

Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.



                    L.F.
          Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid
          in school wants    to play right away.
              (to Bill)
          How bout it new    kid, you wanna
          handle my bones,    or do you just
          like to watch?

Dropping his money roll on the table...



                    BILL
          I came to play.

Color L.F. impressed.



                    L.F.
          Boys take a look at this man, he's
          what Webster's calls, a gambler.
          The dice belong to you , sir.

With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes
them and inspects them.

                    L.F.
          I hope you're not implying
          anything, friend?



                    BILL
              (as he inspects dice)
          I'm not implying anything.

Alburt starts to move from his position by the door.



                    ALBURT
          That did it fuckhead, you're out
          the door --

L.F. motions him back to his position.

The players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the
table, trade quips.

Bill looks from the dice to L.F.



                    BILL
          You looked me over when I stood in
          your doorway. I'm looking you over
          as I step up to your table. If I
          don't know, I don't throw.



                    L.F.
          Are you satisfied?



                    BILL
          More or less.



                    L.F.
          I think we're getting into a
          antagonistic relationship.



                    BILL
          Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were
          trying to take my money, and I was
          trying to take yours.

                    L.F.
          It's just a game.

Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room
reacts.



                     BILL
          If you're game, take my bet
          sportsman.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then
throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the
money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up
his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says;



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.

The room reacts.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5...



                    L.F.
          The point is five, gentlemen, five
          is the point.

Bill throws...5...more reaction...more money...



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He shoots again, he wins again...

L.F. MOVES THE MONEY in front of him.

Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her
table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent.

In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes
go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F., casually tosses
the green on the felt and says;



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.



                    L.F.
          Pretty lucky tonight, huh?



                    BILL
          Play a game of luck long enough
          you're bound to meet some lucky
          people.



                    L.F.
          You know we've never been properly
          introduced, I'm L.F. O'Boyle.



                    BILL
          And I'm not interested.



                    L.F.
          No, you're rude. Why so rude rude
          boy, I'm only trying to be
          friendly.



                    BILL
          I didn't come here to make friends.
          I came here to shoot a little crap.
          But then your boy over there hits
          me up for a two hundred dollar
          privilege to play fee --



                    L.F.
          -- That's a membership fee, good
          for --



                    BILL

-- You and nobody else. You sell at
the bar a half can of warm piss, at
twenty bucks a shot. How much did
the six-pack cost you? 5.60, 5.65?
You're greedy O'Boyle. You're just
too Goddamn greedy. You know what I
like to do when I meet greedy
people? Take every fuckin thing
they got. Leave em with nothing.



          L.F.
So that's your game, you want to
teach me a lesson?



             BILL
I wanna    burn you    down. When I'm
through    with you,    you won't have a
pot to    piss, or a    window to throw
it out    of. You'll    thumb a ride out
of L.A.    wearing a    barrel.



          L.F.
I could always save myself this
horrible fate by not taking your
bet.



          BILL
To be replaced by a different fate.
The embarrassing truth that you run
a gutless game. I won't forget it.
I'm sure these gentlemen won't
forget it. I'm sure they'll tell
people who won't forget it. And we
won't come back. If we don't come
back, you won't get our money.
Couple of weeks, you won't have a
game.



          L.F.
You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And
the idea of taking everything
you've won away, and sending you
out the door with nothing but a red
face, is so appealing to me, that I
will take your bet. But.....not
with those dice.



             BILL

          Oooohhh, that's....



                    L.F.
          The house's perogative and you know
          it.

She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are
placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards. She sets the
dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her
stick.

Bill looks down at them.



                    L.F.
          Maybe you would like to change your
          bet?



                    BILL
          Yes I would.....Shoot it
          all.....Against myself.

His hand scoops the dice off the table.

He catches the young lady by surprise.



                     L.F.
          What?



                    BILL
          Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet.
          I'm betting I don't make it.

From the door Alburt says;



                    ALBURT
          You can't do that.



                    BILL
          Oh yes I can. It's the shooter's
          perogative, and she knows it.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He throws....

....................BOXCARS.

The spectators go apeshit.

Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he
just busted.



                    BILL
          Can I use your phone?



                    L.F.
          Sure it's next to the bed.



INT. BED AREA OF HOTEL ROOM

Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone.

In the b.g. L.F. is throwing everybody out.



                    L.F.
          Game's over, get out! Get the fuck
          out! No more tonight, go home....



                    BILL
              (into phone)
          Vernita's dead? When?
              (pause)
          What about her family?
              (pause)
          Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone
          completely apeshit. No idea where
          she is?
              (pause)
          Okay that did it, we're going to
          Texas and talk sense into Budd
          before (BLEEP) makes him number
          three.

He looks over and L.F. is sitting on the floor of the bed.
All the players have left, only L.F. and her five tuxedo boys
remain.



                    BILL
          We're going to have a talk about
          this later.
              (pause)

          Well, I'm not exactly among friends
          at the moment.
              (pause...he laughs)
          I'll keep that in mind, bye bye.

He hangs up.



                    BILL
          Got a nose problem?



                    L.F.
          I said you could use my phone. I
          didn't say I wouldn't listen.



                    BILL
          This is true.



                    L.F.
          You didn't burn me down you know?



                     BILL
          Course not. First rule of any
          house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY
          comes in and wipes the place out
          insurance.



                     L.F.
          If there weren't losers it wouldn't
          be a game.

Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket
pocket, looking at L.F. and her boys, he says;



                    BILL
          I sincerely hope you mean that.

Without another word he exits the hotel room.

Nobody makes a move to stop him.

L.F. O'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for
the sound of the elevator in the hall.

The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack;

                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was,
             the real game was just beginning.
             Bill was on the job, and she was
             the target. Now Bill was the
             greatest assassin of the 20th
             century. In fact the term HITMAN
             was coined for him. And he rarely
             performs actual assassinations
             anymore. However every once in
             awhile - to keep his hand in - he
             does. Only he plays a game. He
             doesn't start big trouble...he lets
             them start it. If they do, they're
             dead. If they don't, not only won't
             he perform, he'll take the hit off
             the market. It's kind of fun
             watching people gamble when they
             don't know they're gambling, isn't
             it?

They hear the elevator in the hall.

L.F. O'Boyle tells her men;



                       L.F.
             Get my money back. Don't kill him.
             Chop off all his fingers.

Alburt smiles.

The Five men go out the door.



INT. HALLWAY HOTEL

The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to
see....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the
end.

This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.

He Charges at them.

In the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His
mastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts
through    the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,
is the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's
blade.



INT. HOTEL ROOM

L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the
front door.

She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for
that matter, to step through the doorway.

WHEN...

The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black
gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and
YANKS her out the window.



EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT

Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor),
outside L.F. O'Boyle's room.

He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side
by her hair.



                    BILL
          Do you know a Jessica?

L.F. Is too hysterical to answer.



                    BILL
          Well, she knows you.

He drops her......

............... SHE FALLS....

...................................SHE SPLATS.

Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her
fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

BLACK FRAME
TITLE CARD:


                        Chapter seven

                     "The lonely grave of
                        Paula Schultz"



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY

A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle
of a barren Texas wasteland.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image;

                           "The city of
                          Austin Texas."

A fist knocks on the trailer door.

It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick
Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black
cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre.
No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle
five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live
there.

Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and
dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his
natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging
in the passenger's    seat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;



                    BUDD
          Great day in the morning. Brother
          Bill livin up to his familia
          obligation.



                    BILL
          How ya doin' Budd?



                    BUDD
          Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a
          mad rush of wild parties and
          wealthy women.

Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.



                    BUDD
          Is that that tall blonde one-eyed
          Viking bitch in the passenger seat?



                    BILL
          It's Elle. Want to say hello?



                    BUDD
          Never said "bye," can't seem to
          think of a reason to say, "hi."

INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR

Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air
conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through
the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between
Elle and Budd.



                    BUDD
          What'd ya wanna talk about?



                    BILL
          Are you not going to invite me in?



                    BUDD
          No.



                    BILL
          May I ask why not?



                    BUDD
          It stinks in there, that's why. Now
          what's so important it requires a
          reunion?

                                                TIME CUT

The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits
in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand.
Bill stands.



                    BUDD
          You tryin to tell me she cut her
          way through eighty-eight bodyguards
          'fore she got to O-Ren?



                    BILL
          No. There wasn't really eighty
          eight of them, they just called
          themselves The Crazy 88.



                    BUDD
          Why.



                    BILL

          I dunno, I guess they thought it
          sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about
          26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP)
          attacked. They all fell under her
          Hanzo sword.

The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention.



                    BUDD
          She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?

Bill nods his head, "yes."



                    BILL
          She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.



                    BUDD
          He made her one? Didn't he swear a
          blood oath never to make another
          sword?



                    BILL
          It would appear he's broken it.

Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN;



                    BUDD
          Them Japs know how to carry a
          grudge don't they? Or is it just
          you tend to bring that out in
          people?



                    BILL
              (pause)
          I know this is a ridiculous
          question before I ask, but you by
          any chance haven't kept up with
          your swordplay?



                    BUDD
          Hell, I pawned that years ago.



                    BILL
          You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?

                    BUDD
          Yep.

The disrespect is pain.



                    BILL
          It was priceless.



                    BUDD
          Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso
          I got me 250 Dollars for it.



                    BILL
          Since it was a gift from me, why
          didn't you offer me the chance to
          buy it back?



                    BUDD
          Because that would've required me
          to acknowledge your existence.
          Drunken bum though I may be, I
          don't need booze that bad. But who
          the hell gives a crap anyway. That
          bitch ain't gittin no Bushido
          points for killin a white trash
          piece of shit like me with a
          samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a
          titty bar, Bill. If she wants to
          fight me, all she gotta do is come
          down to the Club, start some shit,
          and we'll be in a a fight.



                    BILL
          -- Budd, you need to listen to me.
          I know we haven't spoken for quite
          some time, and the last time we
          spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But
          you need to get over being mad at
          me, and start becoming afraid of
          Bea. Because she is coming, and
          she's coming to kill you. And
          unless you accept my assistance, I
          have no doubt she will succeed.

Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare.

Bill tries to charm his brother.

                       BILL
             Can't we forget the past, and look
             at the happy side of all this?

Budd chuckles.



                       BUDD
             And what would that happy side be?



                       BILL
             She's brought "the boys" back
             together.

Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself.



                       BUDD
             I appreciate the concern on your
             face, but there's a difference
             'tween "the boys", time can't
             erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I
             don't Jew outta payin my
             comeuppance. That woman deserves
             her revenge. And we deserve to die.
             But then again, so does she. So I
             guess we'll just see now, won't we.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at.    His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when    they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar. No strippin goin
on yet, just a few BARFLIES drinkin. The owner, TED, yells at
him as he walks by.



                       TED
             You're late, Budd, this shit ain't
             school, ya know.

Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back,

passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks.



                       STRIPPER
          Hey, Budd.



                    BUDD
          Hey, Lucky.

ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies' room and says to
him;



                    STRIPPER
          Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at
          it again. There's shitty water all
          over the floor.



                    BUDD
          I'll take care of it, Suzie Pie.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking
lot and stops.

The BRIDE
sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front
door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long
blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her
noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the
truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"
tee-shirt.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage
explodes into honky tonk guitar. She walks up to the bar and
oders a;



                       THE BRIDE
          Shiner.

The BARTENDER gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock. As she
drinks the Texas brew...SHE....

...Watches the BAND....

...The crowd...

...Looking for Budd among the crowd...

...She sees him...

...He's the bouncer...

...She observes him...

...he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his
head to the music...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on
the soundtrack.

Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through
the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd
sitting oblivious on his stool....

WHEN...

Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling
every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over.

Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area.

The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE.



EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.

He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the    dark.

Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,
trailing him.



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper
home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.

The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out
of her windshield...

Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We
see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.

The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai

sword.

She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma
Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute
member of the audience will read the significance of her
choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The
Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she
intends to send to his maker.

She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her
skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...

THEN...

...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both
eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...

THEN...

Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,
and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.

THEN...

On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she
crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.

THEN...

Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their
fight makes a LOUD racket.

The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.

From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off
the phonograph.

From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking
out the window of the camper.

The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.

The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound
he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the
claws of a cat.

The curtain closes again.

The needle is placed back on the phonograph.

CU The BRIDE
face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her
eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins
crawling towards the trailer again.

...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the
sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.

She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of
pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on

a table.

Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,
slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.

Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted
image of Budd's feet on the floor.

She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde
hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left
hand grabs the front doorknob...

QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's
handle down hard on the door lock --

EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.

She flings the front door open...

The BRIDE'S POV:
Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back
and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a
DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.

SERGIO LEONE CU:
The Bride Blinks.

Both barrels BLAST in our face.

The BRIDE
standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and
PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.

Landing hard on her back in the dirt.

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the
needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.

Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the
trailer looking down at The Bride.

BUDD'S POV:
The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated
from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from
her throat.

Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over
The Bride.



                     BUDD
           Bet your sweet ass that don't sting
           like a bitch.

More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.



                     BUDD

          You done got a double dose of rock
          salt, right in the ole tit.
          Now not havin tits as fine or as
          big as yours, I can't even imagine
          how bad that shit stings...

He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.



                    BUDD
          ...But I don't wont to neather.

The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,
still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,
right in ole Budd's face.

Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The
cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes
away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.



                    BUDD
          Now I know when it    comes to a rock
          salt burn, you're    feelin pretty
          much like a expert    bout now. But
          truth be told, you    ain't felt all
          rock salt's got to    offer till you
          took a double dose    in your
          backside.

With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto
her stomach, exposing her butt.

SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both
barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.

The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any
opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back
and she lets out a SCREAM!



                    BUDD
          That gentled ya down, didn't it?
          Yep...ain't nobody a badass with
          two barrels of rock salt dug deep
          in their backyard.

THEN...

Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks
a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.

THEN...

Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small
silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,
and presses one button on the panel.

INT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT

The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename
"California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout
with her COACH.

This is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass.
With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the
sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm.

Elle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth.



                      ELLE
          Bill?



                    BUDD
          Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.



                      ELLE
          ....Budd?



                      BUDD
          Bingo.



                    ELLE
          And what do I owe this dubious
          pleasure?



                    BUDD
          I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't
          never been caught.

This gets Elle's attention.



                    ELLE
          Do you mean what I think you mean?



                    BUDD
          If you think I mean I got 'er, you
          thought right.

                    ELLE
          Did you kill her?



                    BUDD
          Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do
          it easy enough. She's so gentle
          right now, I could preform her coup
          de grace with a rock.



                    ELLE
          What are you waiting for, run outta
          liquid courage.



                    BUDD
          No. It's just...I ain't killed
          nobody in a long Goddamn time. And
          just 'tween you, me, and Jesus
          Christ, kinda made me a promise I
          wasn't gonna. Be that however it
          is. Back when I did kill people...I
          got paid for it. Just don't seem
          right...turn amateur this time of
          life.

We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange.



                    BUDD (O.S.)
          Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my
          hand right now.

We cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The
Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword.



                    BUDD
          A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo
          sword. And I'm here to tell ya
          Elle, that's what I call sharp.



                      ELLE
          How much?



                    BUDD
          Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's
          priceless and all.

          ELLE
I'll give you a hundred thousand
dollars for it.



          BUDD
I'm sure you would. But I'll take,
one million.



          ELLE
Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you
were such a capitalist. I thought
drunks like yourself were beyond
such monetary concerns?



          BUDD
Well Elle, a million dollars buys a
whole lotta Jack.



          ELLE
Why then are you selling it to a
hateful bitch like me, when you
know Bill would pay more?



          BUDD
If I'm gonna drink myself to death,
...it won't be on Bill's dollar.
It's gonna be on yours.



          ELLE
What's the terms?



          BUDD
You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll
see you here tomorrow mornin. You
give me a million in foldin cash,
I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man. How's that
sound?



          ELLE
Sounds like we got a deal. One

          condition.



                       BUDD
          What?



                    ELLE
          You kill her tonight.
              (pause)
          And one more thing.



                    BUDD
          You said one condition.



                     ELLE
          It's a caveat to the same
          condition.



                       BUDD
          What?



                    ELLE
          She must suffer to her last breath.



                    BUDD
          That Elle darlin, I can pretty
          damwell guarantee.



                    ELLE
          Then I'll see you in the morning
          millionaire.

                                                 CUT TO:



OVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...
Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be
the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN
WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)
digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot
too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but
not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed

of Budd's pickup.

The BRIDE
She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her
wrists tightly together in front of her.

A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry
brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees
stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.

She has no idea where she is.

She turns her head to the left and sees,

Back window and Cab of truck.

She turns her head to the right and sees,

Hatch Gate to flatbed.

She listens...she hears,

Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says
something to the other in Spanish...

THEN...

She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...

The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...

THEN...

We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a
coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.

BOOM...They set it down.

She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of
leaves leading in her direction...

TILL...

With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the
flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.
Revealing Budd, looking down on her.



                    BUDD
          Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.

She FALLS to the dirt HARD.

Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been
dup up.
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of

"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of
dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;
"PAULA SCHULTZ."

Budd and Ernie stand over her.

The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only
weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.

Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in
English;



                    BUDD (SPANISH)
          Look at those eyes. This bitch is
          furious. You grab her feet, I'll
          get her head.
              (ENGLISH)
          Got anything to say?

The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she
won't give it to them.



                    BUDD (SPANISH)
          In America white women call this
          the silent treatment.
              (laughing)
          And we let 'em think, we don't like
          it.

The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and
carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound
legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips
out a can of mace from his pocket.



                    BUDD
          Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at
          this.

He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her
eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.



                    BUDD
          Looky here bitch, this is a can of
          mace. Now you're goin underground
          tonight, and that's all there is to
          it. But, when I bury ya, I was
          gonna bury you with this.

He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the
beam.

                       BUDD
          But if    you're gonna act like    a
          horse's    ass, I'll spray this    whole
          Goddamn    can in your eyeballs.     Then
          you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried
          alive.    So what's it gonna be
          sister?

Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.



                    BUDD
          You may be stupid, but at least you
          ain't bloody stupid.

The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine
box and place her in.

Budd puts the flashlight inside.

He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over
the coffin...

WHEN...

...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...

...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,

THEN...

...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.

THEN...

...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.



INT. PINE BOX

Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between
the lid and the box. However with each nail pounded in, more
lights is cut off...

TILL...

...the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head. The
last hammered nail obliterates that light source.

The Bride lies in TOTAL DARKNESS.



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.

Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...



INT. PINE BOX

EX CU HER FINGERS turn on the flashlight.

CU The BRIDE
LIT by the flashlight beam...

BAM...

...a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making
The Bride jump...

BAM...

...More dirt. She reacts again.

BAM...

The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with
each new shovelful.

The Bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming
more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside
the pine box.

We've never seen her like this before.

She's starting to lose it...She lets out a SCREAM...She
SCREAMS again...Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the
lid...She pounds on it...Her bound feet kick up at it...She
starts to cry...She's getting hysterical...Her fingers begin
clawing at the wood lid...

TILL...

They're ripped open and bleeding...

Leaving Blood Trails on the wood.

TILL...

She exhausts herself. All this while, she's been screaming
the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth;



                        THE BRIDE
             Help me.

The Bride halts her hysteria.

She wipes    her eyes, and runs her hands down her face,
mentally    sending the little girl she became, back to wherever
she came    from. The woman we know as The Bride is back. She
talks to    herself.

                     THE BRIDE
          Well, now that you've had a nice,
          good cry, let's figure out how to
          get out of here? You're breathing
          like you just been fuckin. Calm
          down...close your mouth, and start
          breathing short breaths, through
          your nose.

She does. The Bride continues in VO;



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's a lot better. But you're
          still too agitated. Can you hear
          your heart? It's like I'm buried
          alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off
          that flashlight.

Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          No! I can't turn off the light. Yes
          you can. The darkness will have a
          calming effect. Now turn off that
          fucking light.

She does. The screen goes Jet Black



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old
coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the
flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,
Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.



INT. BUDD'S TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT

Budd behind the wheel. Ernie in the passenger's seat. Car
radio playing Mexican music. Budd's silver cell phone rings.



                    BUDD
              (into phone)
          Yellow?



INT. AIRPLANE (FLYING) - NIGHT

Elle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the
great state of Texas. She calls Budd on the airplane phone.



                       ELLE
             Didja do it?



                       BUDD
             Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we
             speak.

A smile spreads across Elle's face. She rests her head back
against the seat's headrest. Her eyelids close. She slightly
parts her lips...and lets out a;

                        "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

This is the face of satisfaction.

                                             FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY

We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH:


                "SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"

A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this
landscape;



                       BILL (V.O.)
             Once upon a time in China, some
             believe around the year, one-double
             knot-three.

As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by
footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the
70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as
the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "PAI MEI."

                     BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)
          ...head priest of The White Lotus
          Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the
          road, contemplating whatever a man
          with Pai Mei's infinite power would
          contemplate -- Which is another way
          of saying, who knows. When, a
          Shaolin monk appeared on the road
          traveling in the opposite
          direction. As the monk and the
          priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --
          in a practically unfathomable
          display of generosity, gave the
          monk the slightest of nods. The
          nod, was not returned. Was it the
          intention of the Shaolin monk to
          insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just
          fail to see the generous social
          gesture?
          The motives of the monk, remain,
          unknown. What is known, were the
          consequences. The next morning Pai
          Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,
          and demanded that the temple's head
          Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to
          repay the insult. The Abbot, at
          first, tried to console Pai Mei,
          only to find, Pai Mei was
          inconsolable. So began, the
          massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and
          all sixty of the monks inside, at
          the fists of the White Lotus. And
          so began, the legend of Pai Mei's
          Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart
          Technique.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
          exploding heart technique?



                    BILL (V.O.)
          Quite simply, the deadliest blow in
          all of the martial arts. He hits
          you with his fingertips, at ten
          different pressure points on your
          body. And then, he lets you walk
          away. But once you've taken five
          steps, your heart explodes inside
          your body, and you fall to the
          floor dead.

We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five
shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then

fall to the floor dead.



EXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY

Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through
the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's.



                    THE BRIDE
          Did he teach you that?



                    BILL
          No. He teaches no one the ten-point
          palm - exploding heart technique.
          But he is Nietzsche's psalm
          personified. If Pai Mei doesn't
          kill you, he will make you
          stronger. Now one of the things I
          always liked about you, Kiddo, is
          you appear wise beyond your years.
          Then allow me to impart, a word to
          the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -
          Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash
          him - even for an instant - a
          defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.
          And if you throw any American sass
          his way, he will snap your back and
          your neck like they were twigs, and
          that will be the story of you.



EXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of
the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White
Lotus Mountain.

For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the
White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The
temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But
now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All
the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,
who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some
feared as a devil...neither was wrong.

A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill
leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.



                    BILL
          He'll accept you as his student.

                    THE BRIDE
          Caught him in a good mood, aye?



                    BILL
          More like a sadistic one.

She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.

Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.



                    BILL
          Just seeing those steps again makes
          me ache. You're gonna have plenty
          of fun carrying buckets of water up
          and down that fucker.



                    THE BRIDE
          Why did he accept me?



                    BILL
          Because he's a very very very old
          man. And like all rotten bastards,
          when they get old, they become
          lonely. Not that that has any
          effect on their disposition. But
          they do learn the value of company.



                    THE BRIDE
          When will I see you again?



                    BILL
          That's the title of my favorite
          soul song of the Seventies.



                    THE BRIDE
          What?



                    BILL
          Nothing. When he tells me you're
          done.

                    THE BRIDE
          When do you think that might be?



                    BILL
          That my dearest, all depends on
          you. Now remember, no backtalk, no
          sarcasm.
          Least not for the first year.
          You're going to have to let him
          warm up for you. He hates
          Caucasians, despises Americans, and
          has nothing but contempt for women,
          so in your case, that may take a
          little while. Adios.

ZOOM...

The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all
alone, somewhere in the middle of China.

She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps
to Pai Mei.



INT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE

The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred
years ago, except now it's empty and dusty.

The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin
steps.



                    THE BRIDE
              (yelling)
          Hello!

Her Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple.

PAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back;



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Up the stairs, yankee woman!

A beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's
private chamber.



                    THE BRIDE
              (to herself)
          More stairs, Jesus Christ.

The still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back;

                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
          If it is Christ you seek, turn back
          now.

She climbs the wooden staircase.



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER

PAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a
sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting
area. The Bride enters the room.

She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting
area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her
head.

* From here on end, whenever ENGLISH is spoken     by The Bride,
or every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be     spoken in
ENGLISH IN LIVE SYNCH SOUND. However, whenever     MANDARIN is
supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths     as DUBBED
ENGLISH like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky     Flick.



                     THE BRIDE *
          Teacher, I am unworthy to be your
          student --

Pai Mei is still unseen.



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE *
          Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't
          understand a single word you say.
          It causes my ears discomfort. You
          are not to speak unless spoken to.
          Do you understand Mandarin any
          better than you speak it?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I speak Japanese very well --



                    PAI    MEI'S VOICE *
          I didn't ask    if you speak Japanese,
          or Mongolian,    for that matter. I
          asked if you    understand Mandarin?



                    THE BRIDE *

          A little, I am still learning.



                    PAI MEI'S VOICE *
          You are here to learn the mysteries
          of Kung Fu, not linguistics. If you
          can't understand me, I will
          communicate with you like I would a
          dog. When I yell, when I point,
          When I beat you with my stick!

Her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.

WE CUT TO PAI MEI
He's just like he was in the films earlier. Long White Hair,
Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing
White Robe. Everything's the same, except he's older, by
about a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting
area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.



                    PAI MEI *
          Bill is your master, is he not?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes, he is.



                    PAI MEI *
          Your master tells me you're not
          entirely unschooled. What training
          do you possess?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I am proficient in a combination of
          Tiger and Crane style. And I am
          more than proficient in the
          exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.



                    PAI MEI *
              (he makes a SNORTING
               SOUND)
          The exquisite art of the samurai
          sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so
          called exquisite art, is only fit
          for Japanese fat heads. You really
          are a silly ass.

This brings up The Bride's eye...She GLARES at the old man.

                     PAI MEI *
           Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!

She lowers her eyes.



                     THE BRIDE *
           I'm sorry master --



                     PAI MEI *
           -- Silence! I do not wish to hear
           your unintelligible excuses.

Pause...

THEN...

Pai Mei softly LAUGHS to himself, and strokes his long white
beard...



                     PAI MEI *
           Your anger amuses me. Do you
           believe you are my match?



                       THE BRIDE *
           No.



                     PAI MEI *
           Are you aware I kill at will?



                       THE BRIDE *
           Yes.



                     PAI MEI *
           Is it your wish to die?



                       THE BRIDE *
           No.



                     PAI MEI *
           Then you must be stupid. Rise
           stupid, and let me get a better

             look at your ridiculous face.

She rises.

CU The BRIDE
through the scrim, eyes down.

Pai Mei laughs to himself again;



                       PAI MEI *
             You breathe hard. The one hundred
             steps robbed you of your wind. So
             your stupidity is matched only by
             your weakness. Is there anything
             you do well? -- Oh yes, you speak
             Japanese. I despise the Goddamn
             Japs. I would of thought an
             American would be immune to their
             pompous posturing. Apparently I was
             wrong. Go to that drawer.

The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. She opens the
drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged
weapon.



                       PAI MEI *
             Remove the sword.

The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.

Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,
parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.



                       PAI    MEI *
             Let's see how    good you really are.
             Try and land    a blow. If you land a
             single blow,    I'll bow down and call
             you master.

The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with
the sword.

He deftly moves out of the way.

The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,
with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.

Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of
Effort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out
of the sword's path.

He's amused, and Speaks while they fight;

                    PAI MEI *
          Come now woman, can't you even hit
          an old man?

She tries more...



                    PAI MEI *
          Your ability really is quite poor.

He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an
open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.
She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.

Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.



                    PAI MEI *
          Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought
          cripples who posed more of a
          challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!

She ATTACKS with a wild cat's fury.

He HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.

He LEAPS HIGH UP IN THE AIR, and LANDS STANDING on the Blade
of her Sword.

The Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe
it.

Pai Mei smiles at her and says;



                    PAI MEI *
          From here you can get an excellent
          view of my foot.

He does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the
face in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD
WALL.

The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.

Pai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his
hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling
STOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.



                    PAI MEI *
          Give up? Or care to try again?

The BRIDE'S FACE
shows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,

that she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly
amazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to
quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to
distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.

She takes the sword from him and tries again.

But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the
sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young
girl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other
arm...Poised to cut it Off.



                    PAI MEI *
          That blade's sharp. Careful not to
          cut off your own arm.

...Then he TWISTS her arm, till the blade's against her own
throat....

...Then TWISTS again till it's against her hip...

...Then TWISTS again while KICKING her leg, till the blade's
edge is against her thigh...



                    PAI MEI *
          If you can't fight any better than
          that, what use do you have for a
          leg?

He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...

...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the
stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between
her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.



                    PAI MEI *
          Now that really would be a shame.

He takes the sword from her grasp...

SWINGS once...

The BLADES's against her jugular.

He SWINGS twice...

The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.

He SWINGS a third time...

The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.

                    PAI MEI *
          Your swordsmanship is amateur at
          best.

He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the
blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on
the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls
to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.



                    PAI MEI *
          I'm a hundred and fifty years old,
          and you can't even make me break a
          sweat.

He CHOPS the sword in half with his hand.



                    PAI MEI *
          Let's see your Tiger and Crane
          style match my Eagles's Claw.

Again she ATTACKS...again he eludes.

Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal
style martial arts dance.

As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;



                    PAI MEI *
          ...pathetic.....terrible...you
          idiot, you should've landed that
          blow...you call that crane?...
          Enough, I grow bored.

With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her
wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in
the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He
could literally break her arm in half.



                    PAI MEI *
          I asked you to show me what you
          know, and you did. Not a goddamn
          thing.

He TWISTS her wrist...

...The pain is excruciating.....



                    PAI MEI *
          Like all yankee women, the only
          thing you know how to do is order

          in restaurants and spend a man's
          money.

He TWISTS more...

She CRIES OUT.



                    PAI MEI *
          Excruciating isn't it? I asked you
          a question!

Through gritted teeth, she answers;



                     THE BRIDE *
          Yes!



                    PAI MEI *
          I could chop off your arm at will.
          I think I shall.

He raises his other hand to chop off her arm.

The Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH;



                    THE BRIDE
          No please don't!



                    PAI MEI *
          If you wish to speak romantic
          languages, you've come to the wrong
          place.



                    THE BRIDE *
          Please don't cut my arm off!



                    PAI MEI *
          It's my arm now. I can do with it
          what I please. If you can stop me,
          I suggest you try.



                     THE BRIDE *
          I can't!

                    PAI MEI *
          Because you're helpless?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes!



                    PAI MEI *
          Have you ever felt this before?



                    THE BRIDE *
          No!



                    PAI MEI *
          Compared to me you're as helpless
          as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't
          you?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes!!!



                    PAI MEI *
          THAT'S THE BEGGING!

He lets go of her wrist. She cradles her still-throbbing arm.



                    PAI MEI *
          Is it your wish to learn how to
          make others as helpless as you
          were?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes.



                    PAI MEI *
          Can you cook?



                    THE BRIDE *
          Yes.

                    PAI MEI *
          I'll be the judge of    that.
              (pause)
          Draw me a bath...your    training will
          begin tomorrow. That    arm is still
          mine. You may lose it    yet.

                                                   TIME CUT



EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front
of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,
he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.

The Bride stands behind him, watching.

He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.

He turns to the new student;



                    PAI MEI *
          Since your arm now belongs to me, I
          want it strong. Can you do that?



                    THE BRIDE *
          I can, but not that close.



                    PAI MEI *
          Then you can't do it.



                    THE BRIDE *
          I can put my hand through that at
          six inches.



                    PAI MEI *
          And you could shoot a man from a
          rooftop with a scope-sight rifle,
          if you so desired, but this is not
          what I asked. What if your enemy is
          three inches in front of you, what
          do you do then? Curl into a ball?
          Or do you put your fist through
          him.

He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.

                         PAI MEI *
            Now begin.

The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her
scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....



INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei
concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody.
She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her
fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a
scoop of rice    with her fingers.

Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick.



                      PAI MEI *
            If you want to eat like a dog, I
            will make you live and sleep like a
            dog. Outside. If you want to live
            and sleep like a human being, pick
            up those sticks.

She does.



THE WOOD WALL

The Bride HITTING it.

She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall,
hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her.



                      PAI MEI *
            It's the wood that       should fear your
            hand, not the other       way around. No
            wonder you can't do       it, you
            acquiesce to defeat       before you even
            begin.

He walks off in a huff.



EXT. PIT - DAY

Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round
deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride).

                    PAI MEI *
          In that pit, is a rat.

We see one lone rat in the huge pit.



                    PAI MEI *
          In the sky, is a bird.

Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS
up in the sky.

A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through
it.



                    PAI MEI *
          You are to go into that pit, and
          catch that rat, with your bare
          hands. If you catch the rat, I will
          deem you the victor, and tonight
          you will dine on bird. But, if you
          can't catch the rat by sundown,
          I'll deem the victor the rat. And
          because of the disgrace to my
          student, I will be forced to kill
          it. And then I will force you, to
          consume his body. Because to be my
          student, you must develop a taste
          for victory.

She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes
with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.

The BRIDE
Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu.

MORE wall....

At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.

Trying to catch the rat to no avail.

WHEN...

A golden arrow kills the rat.

She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,
looking down on her. It's sundown.

She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase)
and looks at her teacher.

She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the
golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to
her teacher.

                     THE BRIDE *
          I acknowledge defeat at the paws of
          this rat. However, I will not eat
          this filthy vermin. What I will
          do...
              (she RIPS the rat open
                like a pomegranate)
          ...is consume his victorious heart.
              (she snatches the tiny
                heart from the rodent's
                carcass. Holding it
                between her fingers.)
          But tomorrow, you kill a big bird.

She POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew.

Pai Mei looking down on her, says;



                    PAI MEI *
          How does victory taste?



                       THE BRIDE *
          Bitter.

We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an
affirmative NOD and GRUNT.

The BRIDE'S FIST
goes through the wall.



                       THE BRIDE
                 (to herself)
          Wow!



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE BATHROOM - DAY

Pai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub, when he
hears a noise.



                    PAI MEI *
          Woman, is that you who disturbs my
          meditation?

She answers from outside the door;

                      THE BRIDE'S VOICE (O.S.)
            Yes, teacher.



                      PAI MEI *
            Enter.

She does, bowing to one knee.



                      PAI MEI *
            What news do you find so worthy, as
            to disrupt my bath?



                      THE BRIDE *
            I did it teacher. I put my fist
            through the wall.

                                                  TIME CUT

PAI MEI and the BRIDE
looking at the hole in the wall.



                      PAI MEI *
            Very good. Would you care to
            demonstrate?

She moves in front of the wall.....Takes her position...Her
right hand in a fist -- Locked and loaded into position....
With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where
she'll strike....Like she's transferring her energy into the
wood...She removes her left hand...and...STRIKES!

She hits it HARD, but her fist doesn't go through.

Her eyes sneak a look at the old man, who wears no
expression.



                      THE BRIDE *
            I think you watching is making me
            nervous.



                      PAI MEI *
            Not only that, it has you speaking
            before you were spoken to. Try
            again.

She does.

And when she does, she DOES it.

CU PAI MEI
he says in ENGLISH;



                    PAI MEI
          Impressive.

She immediately goes down to her knees;



                    THE BRIDE *
          Thank you teacher --

He just as immediately, lifts her back up.



                    PAI MEI *
          You still fight better than you
          speak. Finally, a woman who
          understands what's important.

THEN...

He MOVES the wall one inch in front of her.



                    PAI MEI *
          Begin again.

Then the old man leaves to finish his bath.

The blonde gal begins again....Fist against wood...no
effect....starting all over.

                                                 CUT TO:



BACK TO COFFIN, SIX FEET UNDER

PITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in
Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat
of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back.

Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above
her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where
many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound
by a leather belt around her.

Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and
wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots
and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her
bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to
her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside
down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out.

Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her
wrists, till both hands are free.

She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin
lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her
nose, about three inches from her hand.

THEN...

AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins
to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her
left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy
to it...

...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST....

...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her.

With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

A crack in the lid...

AGAIN...

Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride...

AGAIN...

More dirt...

AGAIN...

Even more dirt...

AGAIN...

THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water...

THEN...

Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB -
SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting
plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.



EXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT

A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the

tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her
grave.

WHEN...

The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of
Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother
earth's womb.

Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she
rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's
air as if it were gulps of water.

DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle
on her body.

SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.



INT. DINER - NIGHT

A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG
SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer,
when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's
big picture window that makes him look twice.

SODA JERK'S POV:
Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the
Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the
world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts
character "PIG PEN." With each of her footfalls, a smaller
mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.

The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at
the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;



                    THE BRIDE
          I'd like a glass of water.

                                          FADE TO BLACK.

CU ELLE DRIVER
Behind the wheel of a hot black and gold Trans Am, driving
full out on top of the desert's surface. Spanish Rock coming

out of her powerful speakers.



EXT. DESERT BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

The car stops in front of Budd's camper. She shuts off the
car and the radio.

The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the
bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with
one Good Eye.



                    BUDD
          Want some breakfast?



INT. BUDD'S CAMPER'S KITCHEN - DAY

Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle
sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd
stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as
he finishes telling the tale of last night.



                    ELLE
          ...So that's called a Texas
          funeral?



                    BUDD
          Yep.



                    ELLE
          I got to give it to ya Budd, that's
          a pretty fucked up way to die.
          What's the name on the grave she's
          buried under?



                    BUDD
          Paula Schultz.

Budd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the    name
Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her
pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and    sees
the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the
T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off.



                    ELLE

          Can I look at the sword?



                    BUDD
          That's my money in that black case,
          isn't it?



                     ELLE
          Sure is.



                    BUDD
          Well then, it's your sword now.

The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the
Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair.

She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath.



                    ELLE
          So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

Budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars
with breakfast margaritas.



                    BUDD
          That's a Hanzo sword alright.



                    ELLE
          Bill tells me you once had one of
          your own.

Pause.



                     BUDD
          Once.



                    ELLE
          How does this one compare to that
          one?



                    BUDD
          If you're gonna compare a Hanzo
          sword, you compare it to every

          sword ever made -- wasn't made by
          Hattori Hanzo. Here, wrap your lips
          around this.

He hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. He takes a gulp.



                    BUDD
          So, which "R" you filled with?



                    ELLE
          What?



                    BUDD
          They say the number one killer of
          old people is retirement. People
          got'em a job to do, they tend to
          live a little longer so they can do
          it. I've always figured warriors
          and their enemies share the same
          relationship. So now you ain't
          gonna hafta face your enemy on the
          battlefield no more, which "R" are
          you filled with, Relief or Regret?



                    ELLE
          A little bit of both.



                     BUDD
          Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a
          little bit of both. But I know damn
          well you feel one more than you
          feel the other. The question was
          which one?

Elle looks right at him with her eye, and says;



                    ELLE
          Regret.



                    BUDD
          Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol'
          girl. I never saw nobody buffalo
          Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.
          Bill useta think she was so damn
          smart. I tried to tell him... Bill,
          she's just smart for a blonde.

He looks over at Elle and grins.

Elle looks at him.



                    ELLE
          Want your money?

She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet.

He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open.

Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are
inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all
this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle.



                    BUDD
          Great day in the morning.

He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then
another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks
down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath.

The Black Mamba opens its WIDE JAWS...and LEAPS RIGHT AT
BUDD...

...STRIKING Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession
(three times in the face, and once in the forearm).

Budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles
of money fall with him.

Elle takes a sip of her Margarita.

The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator.

Elle looks down, Budd    lies on his back on the kitchen floor
at her feet. His face    is already grotesquely swollen and
white as a sheet. The    serpent's extraordinarily potent venom
makes a full-frontal    assault on the cowboys's nervous system.



                    ELLE
          Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude
          of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like
          to introduce my friend, The Black
          Mamba.
              (gesturing towards the
               refridgerator)
          Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You
          know before I picked up that little
          fella, I looked him up on the
          internet.
              (she removes her notepad
               from her pocket)

          Fascinating creature the Black
          Mamba. Listen to this,
              (reading from the notepad)
          "...In Africa, the saying goes, in
          the bush, an elephant can kill you.
          A leopard can kill you. And a Black
          Mamba can kill you. But only with
          the Mamba, and this has been true
          in Africa since the dawn of time,
          is death sure. Hence its handle;
          Death Incarnate."
              (looking up from the
               paper)
          Pretty cool, huh?
              (back to paper)
          "...Its neurotoxic venom is one of
          nature's most effective poisons,
          acting on the nervous system
          causing paralysis. The venom of a
          Black Mamba can kill a human in
          four hours, if say bitten on the
          ankle or the thumb. However, a bite
          to the face or torso can bring
          death from paralysis within twenty
          minutes.
              (up from paper to Budd)
          Now you should listen to this cause
          this concerns you.
              (reading from the paper)
          The amount of venom that can be
          delivered from a single bit can be
          gargantuan.
              (looks up from paper)
          -- You know I've always liked that
          word Gargantuan, and I so rarely
          have an opportunity to use it in a
          sentence.
              (back to paper)
          "If not treated quickly with anti
          venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be
          fatal to human beings. However, the
          Black Mamba can deliver as much as
          100 to 400 milligrams of venom from
          a single bite."

Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away. She looks down
at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just
described.



                    ELLE
          Now in these last agonizing minutes
          of life you have left, let me
          answer the question you asked
          earlier, more thoroughly. When it
          comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta
          "R's" in me. Revenge is one.
          Retribution is another. Rivalry is
          definitely one. But I got another

          "R" for that bitch you might be
          surprised to find out. Respect. But
          right at this moment, the biggest
          "R" I feel, is Regret. Regret that
          maybe the greatest warrior I have
          ever met, met her end at the hands
          of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky
          piece of shit like you. The woman
          deserved better.

Budd, dying, watches from the floor as Elle takes out her
cell phone and presses one button. The other party comes on
the line, but we never hear their side.



                    ELLE
              (into phone)
          Bill...Elle. I have some tragic
          news.
              (pause)
          Your brother's dead.
              (pause)
          I'm sorry baby.

Budd tries to make a sound from the floor, Elle calmly places
her foot over his mouth.



                    ELLE (CONT'D)
          She put a Black Mamba in his
          camper.
              (pause)
          I got her, sweety.
              (pause)
          She's dead.
              (pause)
          Let me put it this way. If you ever
          start feeling sentimental, go to
          Austin, Texas. When you get here,
          walk into a florist and buy a bunch
          of flowers. Then you take those
          flowers to Huntington cemetery on
          Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the
          headstone marked "Paula Schultz",
          then lay them on the grave. Because
          you will be standing at the final
          resting place of BEATRIX KIDDO.

She hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man
under her shoe.

Picking up the Hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on
her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money.

CU The BLACK MAMBA
out from under the refrigerator, behind Elle...

Elle senses it. And slowly turns her head to look back..

Both Black Mamba and Elle Driver LOCK EYES...

ZOOM INTO BOTH CU's tighter and tighter, till Elle says;



                    ELLE
          Bring it on, bitch.

The viper known as death incarnate, LEAPS at Elle.

Elle flicks her wrist slightly. She doesn't even swing the
blade. She just holds it.

The snake's head touches it, and is immediately SEPARATED
from its body.

ELLE'S EYES look down at the Japanese steel in her hand.

HANZO BLADE
a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel.



                    ELLE
          Now that's what I call sharp.



EXT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black
suitcase in her hand.

She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am, starts up the
engine, turns on the radio....

WHEN...

...she thinks she hears something...she looks out her
driver's side car door window...

red pickup truck, HEADING RIGHT FOR HER...

her jaw drops open. She's gobsmacked. Not only does she see

coming at her at 100 MPH...

CRASH

The Red Pickup T-BONES the Trans Am, the gold and black car
FLIES through the air, then ROLLS OVER AND OVER about five
times in the desert sand and dirt...ending upside down.

The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of
the black and gold sports car. A smile with the slightest
hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face.

She hops out of the truck and into Budd's camper.

INT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

As she walks through the door, Budd's dead, swollen body
greets her. As does her serpent namesake, dead on the floor
from decapitation.

She begins searching the camper, quickly, for something in
particular. We don't have the slightest clue what it could
be.

The BRIDE'S POV:
She watches from a high perch, Budd practicing with a ...
SAMURAI SWORD.

The BRIDE
searching under his bed, she sees a sword on the floor,
resting in a shiny, black wood mahagony sheath. She removes
it from its hiding place.

WOOD SHEATH
Its one of Hanzo's sheaths. She opens it. It is a Hanzo
sword. Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English
words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from
Bill."

She closes the sheath, this will do. She sees a pair    of
cowboy boots. Picks one up and places the sole of the    boot
against the sole of her foot. Her feet and this man's    boot
are around the same size. She slips her dirty feet in    them.

She's good to go.



EXT. DESERT

Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the
Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck.

A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face.
Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.

The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's
home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten
years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every
footfall creating a cloud of dust.

The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other
in showdown position.

A shark smile spreads across Elle's face.



                    ELLE
          Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that
          alacky had got the best of you.



                    THE BRIDE
          You thought wrong.

The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish.

Elle does the same.



                    ELLE
              (referring to the sword)
          What's that?

                    THE BRIDE
          Guess that makes him a liar, don't
          it?

Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde
warriors circle each other.

          Oooh, not so good.



                    ELLE
          Were I to do it over again, I'd
          bite my tongue.



                    THE BRIDE
          One more question?



                       ELLE
          Shoot.

                    THE BRIDE
          You wouldn't lie to me now?



                            ELLE
          Why lie?

Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position.

The Bride raises up her sword.



                    THE BRIDE
          I saw what you did to that little
          Mamba in there. Want to try that on
          somebody your own size?




                    ELLE
          I intend to.

The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai
bearing.



                            THE BRIDE
          Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before
          we get started. Hattori Hanzo
          swords are extremely sharp. They
          can    take   a    little   getting    used   to.
          Careful not to cut your own arm
          off.



                    ELLE
          I don't rattle, bitch!

The Bride brings her sword back into combat position.



                    THE BRIDE
          You're gonna bleed though, you're
          gonna bleed a lot.

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its

We feel a count of Two Mississippi...

ELLE,

BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's
neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit
the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an
aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle
feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the
spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a
balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the
spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED.

Elle drops the Bride's sword.

As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each
other.

The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is
escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across
at each other, the two women see the other for the first
time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as
bitches...but as sisters.

Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls
to her knees in front of The Bride....

...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against
The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's
leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the
Bride's leg.

The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and
begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.

Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have
been theirs.

Bill on the patio of his beautiful hacienda home (named Villa
Quatro) located on the beach in Mexico. At the moment Bill
partaking of his current hobby......Flower Arranging.

With his hands among various flowers of BRIGHT COLORS, he
sorts and prunes a very pretty arrangement.

Bill's Mexican housekeeper, JOSEPHINA, appears on the patio.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Mr. Bill, you wanted me to tell you
          to leave now.



                    BILL
              (finishing up)
          Yes, I got to go and meet the
          Duchess.
              (referring to the flowers)
          Do you like it?



                    JOSEPHINA
          Oh yes Mr. Bill, it's very pretty.



                    BILL
          Why don't you put it on the dinner
          table, so we can enjoy it tonight.



                    JOSEPHINA
              (she takes it)
          Good idea, she'll love it.

As he heads out the patio, he tells her;



                    BILL
          Oh and Josephina, take the
          remaining flowers and spread them
          around the house, if you would.

                    JOSEPHINA
          Yes, Mr. Bill.

He exits the patio, then turns around and pops his head back
in.



                    BILL
          You know I just had a great idea.
          Take the roses, and spread the
          petals on the bed I just got for
          her. That'd be a nice thing to come
          home to, wouldn't it, a bed of
          roses.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Oh, she'll love that Mr. Bill.



                    BILL
          You wouldn't mind doing that for
          me, would you Josephina?



                    JOSEPHINA
          No, not at all.

FLASH ON
EX CU The Bride
...watching...
A SUSPENSE THEME PLAYS OVER THE SHOTS of The Bride's Eye
every time we cut to it. Over the SHOTS OF BILL DRIVING we
hear a SPANISH TRAGIC LOVE BALLAD, coming from the car radio.

BILL
driving his convertible as the beach WHIZZES by in the
background.

The Bride's eye.

Dirt Road, lined by greener than green trees, the Porsche
kicks up dirt ZOOMING down it.

CU BILL
driving as the Spanish love song plays.

The Bride's eye.

A striking but antiseptic-looking INSTITUTION of some sort,
surrounded by the beautiful foliage of Mexico. Bill's silver
Porsche drives up its driveway.

The Bride's eye.



INT. INSTITUTION

The institution is not Spanish in style, but on the contrary
it's a clinical new-age box-like structure made up of clear
glass doors and walls and the color beige.

Bill walks through the glass doors, to a lone Asian FEMALE
RECEPTIONIST, her desk is the only furniture in the lobby. In
JAPANESE he explains to her his reason for being there.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
...watching...we now leave any shot of Bill not from the
Bride's perspective. The SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER
and TIGHTER as we look through the Bride's POV and listen to
her VO;



                    THE    BRIDE (V.O.)
          The attentive    audience members
          among you will    have probably
          noticed, that    all my kills have
          been straight    up fights.

The Bride's POV: The Glass-enclosed Institution, and Bill
standing by himself in the empty lobby.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Y'all figured I'd face him with my

          Hanzo sword, aye? Well, I figured
          Bill figured the same thing. I am
          the product of three godfathers.
          Bill, Pai Mei, and Hattori Hanzo.
          Different teachers teach you
          different things. But one thing I
          learned from all three, was "in
          combat, the opponent that does the
          unexpected, can usually expect to
          be the victor." Bill would never
          see this coming. Not from me. And
          least any of you judge me a
          bushwhacker, remember...It was Bill
          who taught me how to shoot.

As the Bride has said these things, WE'VE seen    INSERTS of her
putting together her high-powered scope rifle.    Snapping on
the scope sight. Setting the FOCUS through the    CROSSHAIRS.
Loading the heavy-duty AMMO. Curling her long    white finger
around the rifle's TRIGGER.

SCOPE SIGHT POV: Bill's head in between the Crosshairs.
SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER STILL...it will soon
break.

WIDE SHOT
looking through the Institution's glass wall. The elevator in
the lobby opens...and A LITTLE GIRL steps out, and runs into
Bill's arms. A LITTLE GIRL about five years old. A FIVE-YEAR
OLD LITTLE GIRL with blonde hair. Bill picks up the Little
Girl and lifts her HEAD into the CROSSHAIRS of the SCOPE
SIGHT.

SUSPENSE THEME SNAPS into an OPERATIC WAIL...

EX CU: The Bride's finger, pops off the trigger.

EX CU: The Bride's eye, A HUGE TEAR FALLS OUT...We move out
of the eyeball, into a MEDIUM CU of The Bride, tears falling
down her face...She can't believe what she's looking
at...that's her daughter...She's alive...

Her REMEMBERING THEME PLAYS...

FLASH ON
The Bride remembering, while she was in her wide-eyed coma
state, lying on an operating table, as DOCTORS AND NURSES
performed a Cesarean childbirth on her. The NEWBORN INFANT is
passed to other hands above her wide-eyed unblinking
expressionless face.

CU of The BRIDE
In one moment, Bill has managed to suddenly change the game.



EXT. LONG LONG LONG EMPTY ROAD IN MEXICO - DAY

Silence, except for a few birds.

THEN...

WE HEAR the Roaring of an Engine, and the Silver Porsche
WHIZZES into FRAME.



INT. PORSCHE (MOVING) - DAY

Bill behind the wheel, his little girl asleep in the
passenger seat. He sees something ahead.

A convertible Volkswagen Karman Ghia enters the road heading
in the opposite direction. It's a long long long way off, but
it will get closer every second.

Bill senses something about this automobile, and throws a
glance at his sleeping child.

His cell phone RINGS, he answers it.



                    BILL
          Hola.



INT. THE BRIDE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Bride behind the wheel of the convertible, her long
blonde hair whipping in the wind, talks to Bill for the first
time in five years and six months.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Bill.



                    BILL
          Kiddo, is that really you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, it's me all right.



                    BILL
          I hear you were driving a truck?



                    THE BRIDE
          My pussy wagon died on me. Who's
          your little friend?

He glances down at the sleeping child.



                    BILL
          Oh, you mean the little tow head
          next to me, who looks
          extraordinarily like you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yeah, that one.



                    BILL
          Her name is B.B.

The Bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice.



                    THE BRIDE
          B.B.?



                    BILL
          Yes. Do you approve?

She wipes her eyes. Her hand moves under her shirt,
fingertips rest on scar.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes. Can she hear us?



                    BILL
          Not now, she's in dream land.



                    THE BRIDE
          How old is she?



                    BILL
          What do you mean by that?



                    THE BRIDE
          How many years has she been alive?

          BILL
Don't ask how old she is, ask, if
she's five.



          THE BRIDE
Is she five?



          BILL
Aren't mothers like God, aren't you
supposed to automatically know?



          THE BRIDE
I did and I do.
    (pause)
I want to meet her.



          BILL
Have dinner with us at my hacienda
tonight. She's expecting you.



          THE BRIDE
What do you mean?



          BILL
I knew you were on your way, so I
told B.B. Her mommy was coming to
see her.



          THE BRIDE
    (confused)
What have you told her about me?



          BILL
That you were sick, that you were
asleep, but one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been
asleep since I was born, how will
she know what I look like?" To
which I replied, "Because Mommy's
been dreaming of you." And she
said, "Then I'm gonna start
dreaming of her." So I gave her a

          picture of you --



                    THE BRIDE
          -- which one?



                    BILL
          The one I took of you in Paris,
          sitting on the steps with the
          baguette in your hand. Since she
          was one and a half years old, she's
          slept with that picture of you next
          to her bed.

The EXACT PHOTO DISSOLVES OVER The Bride's face, then
DISSOLVES AWAY.



                    THE BRIDE
          You know, prettier photos of me do
          exist.



                    BILL
          And she's seen them. But the one
          she wants looking after her while
          she sleeps is the one of you
          holding bread.
              (pause)
          We normally have dinner around
          seven, is that convenient?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes.

Pause....The cars get closer...



                    THE BRIDE
          When do we cross swords?



                    BILL
          Well, it just so happens, my
          hacienda comes with its very own
          private beach. And my private
          beach, just so happens to look
          particularly beautiful bathed in
          moonlight. And there just so
          happens to be a full moon out
          tonight. So, swordfighter, if you

          want to sword fight, that's where I
          suggest. But if you wanna be old
          school about it - then we can wait
          till dawn, and slice each other up
          at sunrise, like a couple real life
          honest to goodness samurais. As per
          usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big
          decisions up to you.

The cars will soon pass...



                    THE BRIDE
          Do me a courtesy?



                      BILL
          Anything.



                    THE BRIDE
          Slow down as we pass...I want
          another look at her.



                    BILL
          Wear something nice tonight?



                    THE BRIDE
          I have a dress all picked out.



                    BILL
          Will I like it?



                    THE BRIDE
          You said I looked beautiful last
          time you saw me in it.



                    BILL
          I'll dress up too.

His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does
the same.

The cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass.

The Bride looks into the other car.

We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat.
We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill
holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our
face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF.

The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the
driver's side window EXPLODES over her head.

The two cars pass each other.

The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks
in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing
the cell phone she screams in it;



                    THE BRIDE
          You fucking maricone!

Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview.



                    BILL
          Now you just wait one second there
          little missy. Unless I'm confused,
          we are trying to kill each other
          aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on
          taking a shot at you in front of
          the squirt, but, she is asleep. And
          if you're gonna forget everything I
          ever taught you, and gawk like you
          ain't got good sense, I'm gonna
          take a shot, am I not?



                    THE BRIDE
          Did she wake up?



                    BILL
          Of course not. She's like you that
          way.
          I look forward to this evening. It
          was great speaking with you, Bea.

He hangs up.



INT. WHERE HATTORI HANZO SLEEPS - JAPAN - NIGHT

Hattori Hanzo lies sleeping on his mat...

WHEN...

His phone wakes him up in the middle of the night...He
hurriedly answers it.

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
              (in phone; groggy)
          Hello....



INT. MEXICO HOTEL - DAY

The Bride's on the phone, calling Japan, in tears.



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Hattori!



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Beatrix, what's wrong?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          She's alive! My baby girl's alive!

                                                 CUT TO:



INT. THE BRIDE DRIVING TO BILL'S VILLA

The same shot we saw during the opening credits. She's
dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one
she was bushwhacked in.

Over her CU we DISSOLVE TO A CU OF HANZO talking to her
earlier on the phone.



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          Half of Bill's strength, lies in
          his talent for the unexpected.
          If you intend to vanquish this man,
          and claim your daughter, you must
          not only expect the unexpected. You
          must do the unexpected.

WE DISSOLVE BACK to The Bride.

We see the same shots as before of The Bride driving up to
Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his
front door. We see TWO BLACK-SUITED MALE SATELLITES approach
her.

Now comes the new stuff.

She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the
boot, and removes her MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN.

The two satellites freeze...

She SLIDES THE PUMP once, and FIRES.

ONE is BLOWN APART by the blast.

She SLIDES THE PUMP a second time...BLAST.

TWO buys the farm.

She slides the PUMP again...

...and BLASTS the front door, kicking it open and stepping
inside.



INT. BILL'S VILLA - NIGHT

ANOTHER BLACK-SUITED SATELLITE hurries down the stairs,
reaching for his weapon...

She FIRES the shotgun into his kneecap...

He TUMBLES down the stairs landing at her feet.

She points the shotgun straight down at his face.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Manny.

She FIRES...Then moves further into the house.

Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan.
Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes
across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head
for parts unknown.

So far, so good.

She enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook
and housekeeper, Josephina.

Josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her.



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello Josephina.



                    JOSEPHINA
          Hello Miss Beatrix.

She grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen
pantry.



                     THE BRIDE
          Stay in here and don't come out. If
          you leave this room I'll shoot you,
          comprende?



                    JOSEPHINA
          Yes.

She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway
leading to the living room.

With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she
moves down the hall. As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to
her from around the corner.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Kiddo! If you're through shooting
          the servants, I'm in the living
          room. You remember how to get to
          the living room, don'tcha? Go down
          to the end of the hall, and make a
          left.

Back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end.
She pumps the slide, and TURNS THE CORNER - SHOTGUN RAISED -
READY TO FIRE...

WHEN...

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES - blink once.

EX CU HER FINGER comes off the trigger.

What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a    tuxedo,
holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her.    Standing
next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed    up in a
very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange
squirt gun, aimed at The Bride.

The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says;



                     BILL
              (loudly)
          Bang Bang!

Then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been
shot.

                    BILL
          Oh B.B., Mommy got us.

B.B. lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside
her dad...Bill falls to the floor.



                    BILL
          Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

B.B. parrots this.



                    B.B.
          Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

Bill on the floor, says up to his little girl;



                    BILL
          Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot
          you.

The little girl falls down pretend dead.

The Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them,
is truly thrown.

Bill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying
breath;



                    BILL
          You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You
          are-the fastest.

And with these last words, pretends to die.

But then while pretending to be dead, he speaks in a dramatic
narrator's voice.



                    BILL
          But...little did Quick Draw Kiddo
          know,...that five-year-old B.B.
          Gunn was only playing possum, due
          to the fact she was impervious to
          bullets.

B.B. raises her head off the floor and says;



                     B.B.

              (to Mommy)
          I'm impervious to bullets, Mommy.



                    BILL
              (to B.B.)
          Hey, get back down there, you're
          playing possum.

The little girl's head drops back down.

Bill continues his dramatic narration;



                    BILL
          So, as the smirking killer
          approached, what she thought, was a
          bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when
          the little B.B. Gunn fired.

B.B. springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says;



                       B.B.
          Bang bang!

The Bride continues watching in gobsmackery.

Bill raises his head off the floor, and says to her in his
normal voice;



                    BILL
          Mommy, you're dead - so die.

The Bride shakes off her confusion, and acts out a big death
scene fo her little girl.



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have
          known, you are the best.

She falls to the floor and pretends to die.

The little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl
in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy.

Mommy opens her eyes.



                    B.B.
          Don't die Mommy, I was just
          playing.

From the floor, looking up at her daughter, she speaks to her
for the first time.



                    MOMMY
          I know baby.

They embrace each other.



                    B.B.
          I waited a long time for you to
          wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me
          - I dreamed of you?

The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins
to creep into her voice;



                    THE BRIDE
          Every single night, baby.

She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better
look at her.



                    THE BRIDE
          Now let me look at you. My my my...
          What a pretty girl you are.



                    B.B.
          You're pretty too, Mommy.

B.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair.



                       THE BRIDE
          Thank you.

All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor.



                    BILL
          When I showed you Mommy's picture,
          tell Mommy what you said.

The little girl gets shy.



                       BILL

          C'mon shy girl, you know what you
          said, tell Mommy, it'll make her
          fell good.

As she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says;



                    B.B.
          I said - I said - You're the most
          beautiful woman I ever saw in the
          whole white world.



                    BILL
          That's the truth. That's what she
          said.

B.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the
Bride's wedding gown.



                    B.B.
          What's that?



                    MOMMY
          Oh, Mommy spilled something on her
          dress.



                    B.B.
          Blood?



                    MOMMY
          No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?



                    B.B.
          No.



                    BILL
          Do you not like it, or do you not
          know what it is?

Parroting Bill;



                    B.B.
          I do not know what it is.

                    MOMMY
          Well, it's a very tasty beverage
          that I used to drink, when I was a
          little girl. It comes in a lot of
          different flavors and colors, and
          it's really good. Maybe we should
          fix some sometime. Want to do that?

The little girl gives a big nod, yes.



                     BILL
          Speaking of fixing and drinking and
          eating, I think it's dinner time
          don't you?

B.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes.



                    BILL
              (to Mommy)
          When you were doin all that fancy
          shootin, you didn't happen to shoot
          a nice Mexican woman about forty
          five years old, did ya?



                    MOMMY
          No.



                     BILL
              (wiping imaginary sweat
               off his brow)
          Whew, then dinner should be done.
              (shouting to the other
               room)
          Josephina! You can come out now,
          we're ready for dinner.



                    JOSEPHINA (O.S.)
          Yes, Mr. Bill.

He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then
says to B.B.;



                    BILL
          Want to go on top of the world?

She says excitedly;



                      B.B.
          Yeah!

He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and
as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through
the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The
Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World." It's obviously one of
their songs.



INT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT

The dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father
and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.



                    BILL
          B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
          prettiest hair in the whole wide
          world?



                      B.B.
          Yes I do.



                    BILL
          In fact it's better than pretty.
          What's better than pretty?



                      B.B.
          Gorgeous.



                    BILL
          Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is
          gorgeous.

The Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill.



                    BILL
          You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at
          Daddy.



                      B.B.

Why? Where you a bad daddy?



          BILL
I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad
daddy.
    (to Mommy)
Our little girl learned about life
and death the other day.
    (to B.B.)
You want to tell Mommy about what
happened to Emilio?



          B.B.
I killed him. I didn't mean to, but
I stepped on him and he stopped
moving.



          BILL
Emilio was her goldfish. She came
running into my room holding the
fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy
daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said,
"Really, that's so sad. How did he
die?" And what did you say?



          B.B.
I stepped on him.



          BILL
Actually young lady, the words you
so strategically used were, "I
accidentally stepped on him."
Right?



          B.B.
Yeah.



           BILL
To which I queried, "And just how
did your foot accidentally find its
way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And
she told me no no no, Emilio was on
the carpet when she stepped on him.
    (beat)
Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And
just how did Emilio get on the

carpet? And Mommy, you would have
been real proud of her, because she
didn't lie. She said she took
Emilio out of his bowl, and put him
on the carpet. And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet, baby?



          B.B.
He was -- flapping.



          BILL
And then you stomped on him?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And when you lifted your foot up,
what was Emilio doing then?



           B.B.
Nothing.



          BILL
He stopped flapping, didn't he?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And you knew what that meant,
didn't you?



           B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
What did that mean?

          B.B.
He was dead.



          BILL
    (to Mommy)
She told me later, that the second
she lifted up her foot and saw him
not flapping, she knew he was dead.
Is that not the perfect visual
image of life and death? A fish
flapping on the carpet, and a fish
not flapping on the carpet. So
powerful even a five-year old child
with no concept of life and death
knew what it meant. Not only did
she know Emilio was dead, she knew
she had killed him. So she comes
running into my room, holding
Emilio in both of her little hands -
it was so cute - and she wanted me
to make Emilio better. And I asked
her, why did she step on Emilio?
And she said, she didn't know. But
I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt
Emilio, you just wanted to see what
would happen if you stepped on him,
right?



          B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
And what happens when you stomp on
Emilio, is you kill him. And you
discovered that, didn't you?



          B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
So we drove down to the beach, had
a little funeral, and gave Emilio a
burial at sea. And right now I'm
sure he's happy as can be, swimmin
around in fish heaven.
But the point being, our child
learned two very important lessons.
One, about life and death. The
other, somethings once you do, they

can't be undone. I knew just how
she felt
    (to B.B.)
You loved Emilio, didn't you?



            B.B.
Uh-huh.



          BILL
Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I
did to Mommy what you did to
Emilio.



          B.B.
You stomped on Mommy?



          BILL
Worse.
    (making his finger a gun)
I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot,
like we were just doing. I shot her
for real.



            B.B.
Why?



          BILL
I don't know.



          B.B.
Did you want to see what would
happen?



            BILL
No, I   knew what   would happen to
Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't
know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what
would   happen to   me.



          B.B.
What happened?

                    BILL
          I was very sad. And that was when I
          learned, somethings once you do,
          they can never be undone.



                    B.B.
          What happened to Mommy?



                    BILL
          Why don't you ask Mommy.



                    B.B.
          Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?



                    BILL
          No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.



                    B.B.
          Did it make you sick?



                    MOMMY
          It put me to sleep. That's why I
          haven't been with you B.B., I've
          been asleep.



                    B.B.
          But you're awake now, right?



                    MOMMY
          I'm wide awake, pretty girl.



EXT. PORCH - DAWN

Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house
drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and
the sea.

Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps
across from him.

Between them the dawn sky breaks.



                    BILL
          Did she go to sleep easy?



                    THE BRIDE
          It took her a little bit. She was
          excited. She's quite the little
          chatterbox.



                    BILL
          Well, if she doesn't like you, you
          got to kill her to say hello. But
          if she likes you, you can't shut
          her up. She's a chip off the ole
          blonde in that regards.

He holds up the bottle of vino.



                      BILL
          Red wine?

She shakes her blonde head, no.



                    BILL
          C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more
          fun with a couple glasses of wine
          in ya.

She gives him a look.



                    BILL
              (pointing towards the
               beach)
          We're going to go out there and
          have at it, aren't we?

She shakes her blonde head, yes.



                    BILL
          Well, I've already had    a glass. So
          unless you want to win    by an unfair
          advantage, you should    have a glass
          of wine. So we're both    on the same
          footing wine wise.

She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.



                    BILL
          You know, there's an old man down
          here, his name is Esteban Viharo.
          He was a pimp. I knew him when I
          was a child. He was a friend of my
          mother's. I told him about you.
          When I showed him your picture he
          smiles and said;
              (imitating his accent)
          "Yesss, I see the attraction." He
          told me a story about taking me to
          the movies when I was five. It was
          a movie which had Lana Turner in
          it. And whenever she would appear
          on screen, he said I would stick my
          thumb in my mouth and suck it, to
          an obscure amount. And he knew
          right then, this boy will be a fool
          for blondes.



                    THE BRIDE
          Who would of ever thought you'd be
          such a good father?



                    BILL
          Well not you, that's for damn sure.

She gives him another look.



                    THE BRIDE
          Must we have to endure your little
          zingers?



                    BILL
          No we mustn't. But if you're going
          to say sentences like that, in the
          future, I will resist the
          temptation.



                    THE BRIDE
          Baby, you don't have a future.

Bill drinks some wine.

                    BILL
          I sent you to L.A. and you never
          came back. I thought you'd been
          killed. Do you know how cruel it is
          to make someone think someone they
          love is dead? I mourned you. Then
          in the third month of my mourning,
          I track you down. I wasn't trying
          to track you down, I was trying to
          track down - the fucking assholes -
          who I thought killed you. And when
          I find you, what to I find? Not
          only are you not dead, you're
          getting married - to some fuckin
          jerk - and you're pregnant? How do
          you expect me to react?



                    THE BRIDE
          Why do you think I hid?



                    BILL
          Why did you leave in the first
          place? You have cold eyes towards
          me now. I understand their
          temperature, but they were warm the
          second to the last time I saw them,
          or was that just my imagination?



                       THE BRIDE
          No.

The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts
will be shown on the screen.

To give herself a running start with the story she starts it
off in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          You sent me to L.A. to kill that
          lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.

Bill interrupts her.



                    BILL (ENGLISH)
          You are you talking in Japanese?

The Bride explodes;

          THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
What the hell do you care what I
talk in? Don't you know when to
keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to
tell you what you want to know, if
you'll just shut up and listen and
stop talking! Now may I continue?



          BILL
You're right, I'm wrong, continue.



          THE BRIDE
The morning I left, I threw up. I
don't feel like speaking in
Japanese anymore - on the plane, I
threw up. When I got to my hotel, I
threw up. So naturally I started
thinking, maybe I might be
pregnant. So I bought one of those
home pregnancy kits. Went back to
my room and took the test. The
little strip said blue. I was going
to have a baby. I tried to call
you, but you weren't there, so I
just thought I'd call back later.



          BILL
But you never did.



          THE BRIDE
- Would you shut up, I'm trying to
tell you how I feel.



          BILL
My apologies, please continue.



          THE BRIDE
So I just figured I'd call you back
later. I was just so happy, I put
on music and danced by myself in
the hotel suite, holding my little
blue strip.
What I didn't know, was at some leg
of my journey, I was spotted. With
me in Los Angeles it didn't take
Lisa Wong long to figure out
someone put a hit out on her. So
she sent an assassin of her own to

          kill me in my hotel room. As I was
          dancing in euphoria, the killer
          came down the hall.

There's a knock on the hotel room door.

The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.

PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt
outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.

The Bride says through the door;



                    THE BRIDE
          Hello, can I help you?



                    HOTEL WOMAN
          Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the
          hospitality manager of the hotel. I
          have a welcome gift from the
          management.

Seeing it through the peephole.



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda
          busy at this second, could you
          possibly come back later?

As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she
bends down to pick it up...

WHEN...

A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the
bent over woman was previously standing.

Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.

The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.

Karen aims the shotgun down at her.

With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.

It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.

The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.

Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES
the shotgun The Bride's way.

The Bride DIVES out of the way.

The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.

The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,
and THROWS IT across the room at Karen...

Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade
sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,
and drops it to the floor.

The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do
except wait to get shot.



                    KAREN
          So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,
          huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.
          I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here
          to kill you.

She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...



                    THE BRIDE
          Wait a second!

Karen stops.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did
          come here to kill your sister. But
          I'm not gonna do that now.



                    KAREN
          Oh, I know you're not --



                    THE BRIDE
          - listen to me! I just found out,
          right now - not two minutes before
          you blew a hole in the door, I'm
          pregnant.

Karen looks at her, "what?".



                    THE BRIDE
          On that table is the    home pregnancy
          kit. On the floor by    the door is
          the strip that says    I'm pregnant.
          I'm telling you the    truth, I don't
          want to and I won't    kill your
          sister. I just want    to go home.

                    KAREN
          What is this, bullshit story number
          twelve in the female assassin's
          handbook?



                    THE BRIDE
          Any other time you'd be a hundred
          percent right. But this time you're
          a hundred percent wrong. I'm the
          deadliest woman in the world, but
          right now I'm scared shitless for
          my baby. Please, you hafta believe
          me. Look at the strip, it's on the
          floor.

Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the
floor.



                    KAREN
          Sit down on that bed and put your
          hands behind your head.

The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off
the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the
directions on the box.



                    THE BRIDE
          Blue means pregnant.



                    KAREN
          I'll read it myself, thank you.

It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.



                     KAREN
          Okay, say I were to believe you,
          what then?



                    THE BRIDE
          Just go home. I'll do the same.

Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she
leaves, she says;

                    KAREN
          You fucked with the Wong sisters.



BACK ON THE PORCH



                    THE BRIDE
          Facing Karen Wong, was the most
          frightening moment I have ever
          experienced. And that includes
          three years with that evil bastard
          Pai Mei. Before that strip turned
          blue, I was a woman, I was your
          woman. I was a killer, who killed
          for you. Before that strip turned
          blue, I would have jumped a
          motorcycle on to a speeding train
          ...for you. But once that strip
          turned blue, I could no longer do
          any of those things. Not anymore.
          Because now I was a mother. A
          mother who only had one thought on
          her mind. Please don't harm my
          baby. Can you understand that?



                    BILL
          Yes. But why tell me now, and not
          then?



                    THE BRIDE
          You wouldn't have let me go.
          Specially once you found out I was
          pregnant. You would've tried to
          talk me out of it. It would have
          been a big scene. I just said fuck
          it.

Starting to get mad.



                       BILL
          Fuck who?



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill, you couldn't know I was
          pregnant, once you knew, you'd
          claim it, and I didn't want that.

                    BILL
          That's not your decision to make.



                     THE BRIDE
          Yes, but it's the right decision.
          And I made it for my daughter.
          Everybody on this earth deserves to
          start with a clean slate. But with
          us - my daughter would be born into
          a world she shouldn't be. Robbing
          her of the one thing everybody
          deserves. She would be born with
          blood stains. I had to choose. I
          chose her.

She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her
turn.



                     THE BRIDE
          You know five years ago, if I had
          to make a list of impossible things
          that could never happen.
          You performing a coup de grace on
          me by bustin a cap in my crown,
          would be right at the top of the
          list.
              (beat)
          I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?

Bill listens stoney, then;



                    BILL
          I'm sorry was that a question? Of
          impossible things that could never
          happen - yes in this instance you
          would have been wrong.

The Bride listens stoney, then;



                       THE BRIDE
          Well?



                       BILL
          Well what?



                    THE BRIDE
          Explain yourself.

                    BILL
          I already have. When I told you the
          story of when I thought you were
          dead. Didn't you get how badly I
          felt?



                    THE BRIDE
          You call that an explanation?



                     BILL
          Well if that's too cryptic let's
          get literal.
              (beat)
          There are consequences to breaking
          the heart of a murdering bastard.
          You experienced some of them.

That's his explanation.

She hears it.

They both understand one another.



                    THE BRIDE
          You and I have unfinished business.



                    BILL
          Baby, you ain't kidding.

They both laugh.



                     BILL
          You know how proud I am of you,
          don't you?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes.



                     BILL
          You know I was rooting for you,
          don't you?

                       THE BRIDE
          I figured.



                    BILL
          You know on that beach out there I
          want you to be the victor?

She nods her head, yes.



                    BILL
          You also know you're going to have
          to defeat me. I can't just give it
          to you, even though I want to.



                    THE BRIDE
          It won't be necessary for you to
          give me anything. I've surpassed
          you. I'll take it.



                    BILL
          Well, as they say in Missouri, show
          me.



EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING

As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach,
The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket
off, face each other in a combat stance.

The BRIDE
Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in
its sheath.

BILL
stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his
student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to
use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up.
Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He
removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.

WIDE SHOT
The two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend
to charge/attack...stand in showdown stance.

The BRIDE
The VENGEANCE THEME EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
She takes her combat stance. But what she doesn't do is
remove her sword from its wood sheath. The fist of her left
hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. Her right

empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill.
Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in
Japanese;



                       THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Attack me.

She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a
standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an
eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for
his attack.

He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat
grip, to charge her.



                    BILL
              (to himself)
          That's my girl.

He screams a samurai scream...and charges her...

She stands motionless...

Unblinking...

Watching him coming...

No fear....

No expression...

We go back and forth, close, wide, low.

TILL...

They meet...

Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its
grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at
her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his
sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each
other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,
and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His
body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up
a little blood...he looks at her.

Their faces are very close...

The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our
eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with
compassion.



                       BILL

          He taught you the ten point palm
          exploding heart technique?



                    THE BRIDE
          Of course he did.



                    BILL
          Why didn't you tell me?

She doesn't have an answer.

She looks at him apologetically;



                    THE BRIDE
          I don't know...Because...I'm
          a...bad person.

He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;



                    BILL
          No. You're not a bad person. You're
          a terrific person. You're my
          favorite person. But every once in
          awhile...you can be a real cunt.

They smile at each other.

Then...

Bill turns his back to her...

And walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each
step his heart swells, on the fifth...

It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout...

He falls to the beach...dead.

The Bride walks over to his body.

She unsheaths her Hanzo sword.

Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth.

She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the
tiniest of crimson smudges.

She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's
blood from off the blade onto the white cloth.

She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body.

The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this
purpose, has come to the end of its journey.

Beatrix, in a moment    of enormous generosity, allows herself,
one final tear, shed    for her corrupter, her enemy, the father
of her child,...her    MAN. The tear is for her as well. For
she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any other
man's WOMAN.

EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath.

EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek.

The blade disappears inside the sheath.

The teardrop falls of her chin.

Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished
business, is completed.

The Bride exits the beach.

Bill doesn't.
SERIES OF SHOTS END FILM
As a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack.

We see the Bride, get B.B.

The Bride and B.B. are driving away.

The Bride and B.B. eating in a coffee shop.

The Bride and B.B. in a motel room. They both wear bath
towels and both of their blonde heads are wet. The Bride sits
behind her on the bed, combing the little one's head.

The Bride spooning B.B. from behind, both of them are asleep.

It's the morning...

B.B. Sits on the motel room bed, watching Saturday morning
cartoons on T.V.



INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - MORNING

The Bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying
her eyes out.

She shoves a towel in her mouth so B.B. won't hear her.

We wonder for a moment what's wrong...

Till we see her face in CU...

Her tears are tears of joy.

She can't believe this is even happening.

Her daughter is alive. They're together. They get to begin
again.

She covers her mouth so B.B. won't hear her crying and get
worried or confused.

But as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel
room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes,
happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought. Over
and over again....

Thank you god...thank you god...thank you god...thank you
god.

She washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she
walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby,
hugs her from behind as the two watch Saturday morning
cartoons.

TWO SHOT CU
Both blonde heads, the big one and the little one, next to
each other, watching T.V.

The lioness has been reunited with her cub, and all is right
in the jungle.

FADE IN:

1   EXT:   MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREETS - DAY

    Behind the opening credits, we watch a montage of RUPERT
    PUPKIN making his daily rounds as a messenger delivering
    manila envelopes and packages to various New York offices,
    always courteous and polite in his demeanor, PUPKIN is an
    attractive-looking young man just past thirty and dressed
    in a stylish blue suit, broad tie and wide-collared shirt.
    His shoes are neatly polished, his hair carefully groomed.
    As the montage continues, we see that he has finished his
    deliveries and is walking rapidly towards his destination.
    It turns out to be a television theater north of Times
    Square whose marquee announces THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW.
    It is dusk and the show is about to break. There is a
    very small crowd already positioned at the stage door --
    a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have
    stopped to see who will emerge. Three professional
    autograph hunters are clustered together:

    MAE, a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a
    lace hat and much too much rouge.

    SIDNEY is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned,
    slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed. He carries
    a brown lunch bag.

    CELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties.
    She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity.

    A middle-aged MAN, dressed in a corduroy suit,    emerges
    from the backstage door which is guarded by a    large,
    white-haired POLICEMAN. The non-professionals     in the
    crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately    steps in
    front of him with her autograph book raised.

                       MAE
                 (to the MAN)
           Are you somebody?

                       MAN
           No, honey, I'm just a working stiff.

    The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts
    just as PUPKIN arrives.

                         MAE
           Hi, Rupert.

                       CELESTE
                 (coolly)
           Hello, Rupert.

                       SIDNEY
           Who did you get?

                 PUPKIN
           (distractedly)
     Nobody.

PUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or
two away from the other professionals.

                 MAE
           (to SIDNEY)
     I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.

                 CELESTE
           (to SIDNEY about PUPKIN)
     He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney.

                 MAE
     Then I got him again at the
     Pierre at four o'clock.

                 SIDNEY
     Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen
     to have Mr. Vallone.

                 MAE
     You know what I want for him.

                 SIDNEY
     But I have only six Barbra's left.
     You know how difficult she is to
     work with.

                 MAE
     I don't have her even once.

                 CELESTE
           (to MAE)
     Maybe Rupert would help you.

PUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE.

                 SIDNEY
     Would you do that, Rupert? You don't
     feel about Barbra the way I do.

                 MAE
     I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.

                 CELESTE
           (needling RUPERT)
     Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do
     that sort of thing.

                 SIDNEY
     How about it, Rupert?   I'll give
     you whoever you want.

SIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper
bag and reading them off.

                    SIDNEY
     Rodney    Dangerfield ... Richard
     Harris    ... Liza Minelli ... and
     she's    not so easy to work with
     either    ... Louise Lasser!

                 CELESTE
     You're wasting your time.

PUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other
three. Finally he turns to SIDNEY.

                 PUPKIN
     Look, Sidney. I'm just not
     interested. This isn't my
     whole life, you know.

                 CELESTE
     What's that supposed to mean --
     that it's my whole life, or
     Sidney's or Mae's?

                 MAE
     It is so my whole life.

                 CELESTE
     Shut up, Mae. What about your
     mother? Isn't she part of
     your life?

                 MAE
     It's her whole life too.

The show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out.
The crowd around the backstage door swells.

                 POLICEMAN
           (to the crowd)
     If you want Jerry's autograph, give
     me your piece of paper and I'll
     send it backstage.

A number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper.
PUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college
age. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper.

                 PUPKIN
           (to the GIRL)
     What are you going to do with
     Jerry's autograph?

                 YOUNG GIRL
     I don't know. Maybe I'll sell it.

                 BOYFRIEND
     I'll tell you what she's going to
     do with it. She's going to pin

     it on her bulletin board and
     have an orgasm.

The YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously.

                             CUT TO:

LANGFORD's limousine waits directly in front of the stage
door. MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the
door of the car in conversation.

                 CHAUFFEUR
           (wearily)
     No, Mae.

                 MAE
     I don't mean now.

                 CHAUFFEUR
     No, Mae.

                 MAE
     I'll get right out.

The CHAUFFEUR, smiling, shakes his head.

                             CUT TO:

A plain-looking GIRL in a black raincoat and black, floppy
hat stands on the street side of the limousine,
carefully watching MAE and the CHAUFFEUR talk.

                             CUT TO:

                 MAE
     But I've never been in one.

We hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage
door. MAE turns and goes back towards the door.

                             CUT TO:

The POLICEMAN is handing out the autographs. Suddenly
LANGFORD emerges, flanked by three PAGES, husky young men
in their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms.
There is screaming and some yelling of LANGFORD's name.
LANGFORD pays no attention. Smiling nervously, he makes
his way towards the limousine. The CHAUFFEUR stands at
the rear of the car, holding the door. LANGFORD enters
the car and then suddenly springs back. The GIRL in the
black raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the
back seat of the limousine. The three PAGES, who have
already turned and headed back toward the theater, hear
the commotion and swing around. The GIRL, who we shall
come to know as MARSHA, hides herself in the far end of
the limo, so two of the PAGES go around to the far side
of the car and start pulling her out while the third PAGE
moves into the limo from the street side. She fights

like a wildcat, but the PAGES slowly    manage to drag her
out. During the struggle, LANGFORD     stands amid the crowd,
a bit shaken. PUPKIN stands next to     him, staring at him.
When finally catches LANGFORD's eye,    PUPKIN smiles
pleasantly.

                 PUPKIN
           (to LANGFORD who
           barely listens)
     How the hell did that girl get in
     there? Jesus, they certainly
     don't give you very good protection,
     do they?

LANGFORD says nothing, glancing nervously at PUPKIN.

                 PUPKIN
     Look at you here. Who the hell
     is watching you? Any one of
     these freaks could just walk
     right up to you and do whatever
     he wants.

A couple YOUNG GIRLS are pressing against LANGFORD.

                 FIRST GIRL
     Oh, Jerry. How can we get to
     talk to you?

                 PUPKIN
     Just a minute. This is crazy.

PUPKIN straightens up for action.

                PUPKIN
          (yelling at the crowd)
     Okay! Stand back!

PUPKIN wades through the crowd towards the limousine,
pushing SIDNEY and MAE among others out of the way.
LANGFORD follows in the path PUPKIN is clearing.

                 PUPKIN
     Didn't you hear me?!?    Come on,
     people, have a heart.

The PAGES have succeeded in pulling the GIRL out of the
far door of the limo just as PUPKIN and LANGFORD arrive
at the near door. The CHAUFFEUR has been blocked by the
crowd from opening the door so PUPKIN opens it.

                   PUPKIN
     Stand back!    (To LANGFORD)   Go ahead,
     Jerry.

LANGFORD slips in quickly. He looks up at PUPKIN who is
holding the door, smiling pleasantly.

                        LANGFORD
           Thanks.   Thanks very much.

    PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a moment and then slides
    into the limo next to him, closing the door behind him.

2   INT:   LIMO - NIGHT

                       PUPKIN
           I hate to bother you like this, Jerry,
           but could I speak to you for a minute.

                       LANGFORD
           I'd like to but ...

                       PUPKIN
           I know you're a busy man. I promise not
           to take very long, really. But I need
           your advice.

    PUPKIN looks down at his hand which has been badly
    scratched.

                       PUPKIN
           You don't have a handkerchief, do you?
           Jesus, these people will kill you for a
           cufflink.

    LANGFORD hands him a monogrammed handkerchief, then checks
    his watch.

                       PUPKIN
           Thanks. If you have to be somewhere, I
           don't mind talking as we drive. You can
           drop me off anywhere.

                       LANGFORD
           Sorry, but I've got a strict rule never to ...

                       PUPKIN
           I put myself on the line for you, Jerry.

    Reluctantly, LANGFORD signals with his head to his
    CHAUFFEUR to start moving. As the car moves through New
    York traffic, PUPKIN and LANGFORD talk.

                       PUPKIN
           Thanks, Jerry. I'm grateful for this chance
           to talk to you ... I hope I'm not boring you.

                       LANGFORD
           I'll let you know.

                       PUPKIN
           Really? Fine. I'm      Rupert Pupkin, Jerry.
           I know that the name    itself doesn't mean
           very much to you but    it means an awful lot
           to me, believe me.     Maybe you've seen me

     outside your show and wondered who I am.
     Well, right now, I'm in communications but,
     by nature, I'm a stand-up comedian. I know
     what you're thinking -- 'oh no. Not another
     one.' And I wouldn't take up even one minute
     of your time if I wasn't absolutely convinced
     of my talent. I'm really good, Jerry,
     believe me, I'm dynamite. Now you're probably
     wondering if I'm so good why haven't you
     caught my act somewhere, right?

                  LANGFORD
     Well ...

                 PUPKIN
     Well, up to now, I've been biding my time,
     developing my act slowly and carefully so
     that when my big break finally comes, I'm
     ready -- like you were that night Paar got
     sick and you sat in for him. I was there
     that night, in the theater. That was the
     most important night of my life, until
     tonight, of course.

PUPKIN fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket,
flips it open and offers one to LANGFORD.

                  LANGFORD
     No thanks.   I don't smoke.

PUPKIN returns the pack to his pocket.

                PUPKIN
     Me neither. I just carry them as a
     courtesy. How about a cough drop?

                 LANGFORD
           (smiling indulgently)
     No thanks. I don't cough.

                 PUPKIN
     I try not to but sometimes, you know
     ... Am I making any sense?

                 LANGFORD
           (smiling)
     Go on.

                 PUPKIN
     Well, that night you did Paar, I walked
     out of the theater like I was in a dream.
     All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted.
     I started catching your guest appearances
     on Sullivan and taping them and, when you
     got your own show, it got to be a kind of
     regular thing. I studied how you built
     to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like
     you were chatting, and how you delivered

     the jokes without leaning too much on
     them, without saying "here's the punchline,
     folks." And I watched the way you played
     off dead audiences, how you let those long
     silences build until people couldn't
     stand it and then the way you got them
     off the hook with that slow smile. You
     were my college of comedy, Jerry, like
     a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it
     sounds crazy, but when you watch someone
     every night ... But that's all in the
     past. What I'm trying to say is this.
     I'm ready now. I've finished the course.
     And I'm thinking as we sit here talking
     "Is this it? Is this that one big break?"
     Is it, Jerry?

There is a long pause.

                 PUPKIN
     Jerry?

                 LANGFORD
     Look ... er ... what was the name?

                 PUPKIN
     I'm Rupert, Jerry.

                 LANGFORD
     Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying.
     But things don't work that way. You can't
     just walk onto a network show without any
     experience. You've got to start at the
     bottom ...

                 PUPKIN
     But that's where I am!

                 LANGFORD
     You've got to work your way up, learn your
     trade in front of live audiences, start
     playing the little clubs.

                 PUPKIN
     But that can take years, Jerry! Look at
     me. I'm already 31 years old! People my
     age are way ahead of me. I've got some
     catching up to do and I need your help.
     What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking
     you to do is listen to my act. That's all.
     Is that asking too much?

                 LANGFORD
     I get calls from agents every day.
     All they want ...

                 PUPKIN
     I tried getting an agent.   I did, Jerry.

           But you know how it is. You can't get an
           agent unless you're working and you can't
           get work unless you've got an agent ...
           or unless you know somebody. And the
           only person I know is you, Jerry.

    There is a long pause.

                       LANGFORD
           Look, why don't you call my office.

                       PUPKIN
           Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that,
           Jerry. You don't know how many times I've
           had this conversation in my head. And this
           is the way it always turns out. That's why
           I had to sort of invite myself into the car
           tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous
           and I really appreciate the time you've
           given me. But breaks like this don't just
           happen. You have to make your own breaks.

    The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before
    U.N. Plaza. It stops. LANGFORD gets out. PUPKIN follows.

3   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA APARTMENTS - NIGHT

    LANGFORD turn to PUPKIN,    looking to get rid of him as
    cleanly and gracefully as    possible. LANGFORD extends
    his hand. PUPKIN goes to     shake it but his hand is wrapped
    in the handkerchief. He     extends his left hand. LANGFORD
    shakes it awkwardly.

                       LANGFORD
           Nice meeting you, Rupert.   I hope it all
           works out for you.

                       PUPKIN
           Thanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay
           you. I'm a little short on cash this
           evening, but, if you don't mind some good,
           hearty food, I'd be honored to take you
           to dinner.

                       LANGFORD
           Thanks, but some people are waiting for me.

                       PUPKIN
           Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could
           repay you with a joke.

    LANGFORD is starting to walk into the building.

                       PUPKIN
           Wait a minute. How's this? The      first night
           you do your show from the coast,    you open
           this way. "Good evening, ladies    and
           gentlemen, it's great to be back    here in

           Southern California where you can wake up
           in the morning and listen to the birds
           coughing ... "

                       LANGFORD
                 (nodding but unsmiling)
           Not bad. Maybe.

    PUPKIN calls after LANGFORD who heads for the entrance
    to his building.

                       PUPKIN
           Consider it a gift. Hey, Jerry!
           How about lunch? My treat!

                       LANGFORD
                 (turning back before
                 he enters the building)
           Call my office.

    PUPKIN waves with his bandaged hand, notices LANGFORD's
    handkerchief and unwraps it.

                       PUPKIN
                 (to the handkerchief)
           Thanks, Jerry.

    The CAMERA MOVES IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN in a kind of daze.

                                   FADE TO:

4   INT:   SARDI'S RESTAURANT - DAY

    PUPKIN and LANGFORD stand at the edge of the foyer, waiting
    for the Maitre d' to seat them. VINCENT, the owner, spots
    them and hurries over.

                       VINCENT
           I'm sorry, Mr. Langford. (To PUPKIN,
           angrily) How did you get in?

                       LANGFORD
           That's alright, Vincent.   Mr. Pupkin's a
           friend of mine.

                       VINCENT
                 (puzzled)
           Oh, I see.

                       PUPKIN
           That's alright. Now if you'd be good enough
           to find us a nice table.

    PUPKIN pushes a five dollar bill into VINCENT's hand.

                        VINCENT
           Certainly.   This way, please.

VINCENT leads PUPKIN and LANGFORD to the "bullpen," a
select spot in a corner of the restaurant.

                 VINCENT
     Here you are. Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.

                 LANGFORD
     Is Eddie here today, Vincent?

                 VINCENT
     I'll send him over.

A WAITER arrives and hands them the menu.

                 WAITER
     Our specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua
     a la Marinara con Spezi. Very good.

                 PUPKIN
     Sounds like a new opera.

                  LANGFORD
     Fine.   What comes with it?

                   WAITER
     Me.

The three laugh.

                  PUPKIN
     Fine.   For two.

                   WAITER
     Very good.

The WAITER leaves.

                 PUPKIN
     You look tired, Jerry.

                 LANGFORD
     It shows, does it? It's all these problems
     with the show. That and the custody suit.

                 PUPKIN
     I was sorry to read about that, Jerry.
     Charlene never should have gotten the
     kids. If there's anything I can do.

                 LANGFORD
     I appreciate it, Rube. Just talking about
     it a little with you helps.

Eddie arrives. He     is a small, slightly-bald man with
greying hair and a    goatee. He wears a foulard under an
open-necked shirt.     He carries a long sketch pad. He
immediately sets up    a small easel and starts sketching.

                 PUPKIN
     Hasn't Eddie already done you?

                 LANGFORD
     Never mind. You were saying ...

                 PUPKIN
     Well, I've been giving a lot of thought
     to your situation, Jerry, ever since I
     saw you starting to lose ground in the
     ratings. And I think I know what the
     problem is. Too many of the same faces.

                   LANGFORD
     Yeah?

                 PUPKIN
     Sure, people are getting tired of these
     people who live off game shows and talk
     shows and can't really do anything. They've
     seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't
     stand it anymore.

                 LANGFORD
     You know, maybe you're right, Rube.

                 PUPKIN
     I'm sure I am. When a show runs out of
     surprises, it loses its audience.

A YOUNG GIRL stands before PUPKIN and LANGFORD.   She hands
PUPKIN her autograph book.

                 PUPKIN
     What's your name, dear?

                   GIRL
     Dolores.

                 PUPKIN
           (writing)
     To Dolores, who sensed greatness.
     Rupert Pupkin.

                 GIRL
           (reading it)
     Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.

The GIRL leaves.

                 PUPKIN
     You see what I mean? What you need on the
     show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant
     talent making his television debut. Imagine
     the suspense. Who is this young guy? How
     will he do with the eyes of all America on
     him? Something like that has got to help.

                       LANGFORD
           And that's where you come in.

                       PUPKIN
           Why not? Believe me,     Jerry, I'd give you
           the credit you deserve    and I'll stick with
           you. Anytime you need     me, I'll be there,
           doing a few minutes at    Guild scale.

                       LANGFORD
           I'd be grateful, Rube.     I really would.

                       EDDIE
           All finished, Mr. Langford.

    EDDIE turns the caricature so PUPKIN and LANGFORD can see
    it. It's a picture of the two of them, facing each other
    and smiling.

                       PUPKIN
           Oh, Jerry, you sneaky ...

                       LANGFORD
           Looks good, Eddie.

    The WAITER arrives with a bottle of champagne.

                       PUPKIN
           What's this?

                       WAITER
           Compliments of Mr. Sardi.

    EDDIE hangs the picture of LANGFORD and PUPKIN on the wall
    behind them among the hundreds of other caricatures --
    from Bankhead to Sid Caesar to Bette Davis. The CAMERA
    PANS over these. We hear the champagne pop.

                       PUPKIN'S VOICE
           How does your afternoon look?

                       LANGFORD'S VOICE
           What have you got in mind?

                       PUPKIN'S VOICE
           Well, we've still got time to catch
           the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea.

                       LANGFORD'S VOICE
           Why not? But first, a toast. To you,
           Rube and your success.

                       PUPKIN'S VOICE
           Thanks, Jerry.

                                     FADE TO:

5   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - NIGHT

                       PUPKIN
           Thanks, Jerry.

    PUPKIN takes LANGFORD's handkerchief and folds it
    reverentially, tucking it carefully into his breast pocket.
    He claps his hands together a few times for joy and
    dashes into the street to hail a cab.

                                    CUT TO:

6   INT:   LANGFORD'S APARTMENT

    LANGFORD enters his apartment. It is tasteful, modern,
    spacious and empty. A floodlight shines on a single
    setting at the end of a long dinner table. He walks over
    to a large aquarium and sprinkles some food for the fish.

                       LANGFORD
                 (to the fish)
           Say hello to Jerry.

    On a shelf above the aquarium stand three pictures, one of
    two boys, roughly eight and eleven, flanked by a shot of
    each boy alone. LANGFORD walks to the end of the table
    where a covered dish and a New York Post await him. He
    lifts the covered dish which reveals a large, cold salmon.

                       LANGFORD
                 (to the fish)
           Say hello to Jerry.

    LANGFORD begins poking at the fish with his fork.    The
    phone rings. He answers it.

                         LANGFORD
           Yeah.

                       GIRL'S VOICE
           It's Marsha, Jerry. Did you get my note?
           I left it on the back seat. Did you get it?
           I dropped it there before they pulled me
           out. Those guys hurt me, Jerry. (pause)
           Jerry?

                       LANGFORD
                 (icily)
           Who gave you this number?

                          MARSHA'S VOICE
           Don't be    angry with me, Jerry. I didn't
           know what    else to do; I've been trying
           you every    five minutes, I miss you,
           baby ...    Jerry?

    LANGFORD hangs up the phone and then takes it off the receiver.

                         LANGFORD

            Say goodbye to Jerry.

     He shakes his head wearily, returns to his dinner and turns
     to the inside pages of the New York Post.

                                     CUT TO:

7    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT

     A cab pulls up in front of an all-night florist shop.
     PUPKIN dashes out of the cab and into the florist's.
     The cab waits.

                                     CUT TO:

8    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT

     PUPKIN dashes out of the florist's clutching a single red
     rose. He hops back into the cab which starts moving.

                                     CUT TO:

9    EXT:   A STREET OFF BROADWAY - NIGHT

     The cab pulls up in front of Gil's Steaks and Chops, a
     restaurant of little distinction that has a few checkered
     tableclothed tables in the rear and a long bar at the
     front. PUPKIN stares through the window of the bar at
     RITA, the bargirl, an attractive, somewhat shopworn blonde
     in her late twenties. PUPKIN enters.

                                     CUT TO:

10   INT:   BAR-RESTAURANT

     PUPKIN goes to the near end of the sparsely-populated bar.

                         PUPKIN
            Miss!

     RITA comes over.    PUPKIN smiles knowingly.

                        PUPKIN
            A beer please, Miss.    Something imported.

                        RITA
            Heineken's alright?

                         PUPKIN
            Fine.

     RITA serves him a Heineken's.     She stares at him, searching
     his face.

                        PUPKIN
            How have you been, Rita?

     She stares again.

                 RITA
     You're not Rupert Pupkin!

PUPKIN smiles broadly.

                 RITA
     How the hell did you find me?

                 PUPKIN
     Sally Gardner, I met her after a matinee.
     Aren't you glad to see me?

                   RITA
     Sure, sure.    How is old Sally?

                 PUPKIN
     The same, I guess. You know, two kids,
     a nice husband, living in Clifton.

                   RITA
     It figures.

                 PUPKIN
     A lot of the kids in our class have
     moved back.

                 RITA
     What are you doing here?

                 PUPKIN
     I just thought I'd say hello. Here,
     I brought you a little something.

                 RITA
           (recognizing his style)
     Oh, yeah, Mr. Romance.

                 PUPKIN
     Don't forget to put in an aspirin.
     It lasts longer.

RITA fills a glass of water and puts in the rose.

                 RITA
     Nothing's gonna keep it alive in this place.

                 PUPKIN
     How have you been, dear, sweet Rita?

                 RITA
     I don't have an aspirin.

                 PUPKIN
     Maybe a Rolaids would work.

PUPKIN pulls out a pack of Rolaids and hands one to RITA
who smiles vaguely and drops it into the glass.

                 RITA
     Well, what are you up to these days,
     Rupert?

                 PUPKIN
     Didn't you know you'd see me again?

                 RITA
     You still going to the movies?

                 PUPKIN
     You're looking as beautiful as ever.

                  RITA
     Oh, yeah.   I was a real knockout.

                 PUPKIN
     I thought so.

                 RITA
     Well, here I am.     Local cheerleader
     makes good.

                 PUPKIN
     I voted for you for Most Beautiful.

                 RITA
     Yeah?

                 PUPKIN
     I didn't have the nerve to tell you then,
     but I guess it's alright now.

                 RITA
     Well, nothing terrible's gonna happen,
     if that's what you mean.

There is an awkward pause.    PUPKIN stares admiringly at
RITA.

                 RITA
     Well, how are things with you, Rupert?

                  PUPKIN
     Great!   Everything's starting to break.

                 RITA
     Is that right?

                 PUPKIN
     Yeah. As a matter of fact, that's why
     I'm here. I've known about this place
     for a long time. I just didn't want
     to make my move until I had something
     to offer you. Everything's a question
     of timing.

RITA stares at PUPKIN as he rattles on.

                 PUPKIN
     What's the matter?

RITA shakes her head in disbelief and chuckles.

                 RITA
     Jesus Christ, Rupert Pupkin!

                 PUPKIN
           (smiling)
     The two of us are often confused.     He's
     the one with the famous father.

PUPKIN waits for a laugh. RITA just keeps shaking her
head. PUPKIN looks around.

                 PUPKIN
           (critically)
     You like this place?

RITA shrugs.

                 RITA
     Why, you got something better?

                 PUPKIN
     Maybe.

                 RITA
     What?

                 PUPKIN
     What are you doing tonight?

                 RITA
     Tonight?

RITA starts laughing.

                 PUPKIN
           (smiling reluctantly)
     What's so funny?

                 RITA
           (still laughing)
     You call me up all junior and    senior year.
     Night after night after night,    right? And
     every time I'm wondering 'when    is this guy
     going to stop talking and ask    me out?'
     Well, now I know the answer.     August
     twelfth, nineteen seventy-six.     It only
     took you ten, eleven years to    work up to it.

                 PUPKIN
     If I had asked you out?   Would you
     have gone?

                   RITA
     Oh, no.

                   PUPKIN
     Why not?

RITA starts laughing again.

                 RITA
     Because I thought you were a jerk!

                 PUPKIN
     You see! I was right! But that guy isn't
     me anymore. I look at my picture in the
     yearbook and I don't even recognize myself.
     I'm not the same guy, Rita.

A bull-necked MAN in his early forties enters. He waves
a brief hello to RITA as he walks by. RITA smiles and
the MAN takes a seat at the far end of the bar.

                   MAN
     Rita!

                 RITA
           (to PUPKIN)
     Excuse me a minute, honey.

                 PUPKIN
     I'm not honey! I'm Rupert.

RITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a
beer. They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily.
Finally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass.

                    PUPKIN
     Miss!     Miss!

The MAN gets RITA's attention for PUPKIN.   RITA returns
to PUPKIN and serves him another beer.

                 PUPKIN
     I'm in the mood to celebrate tonight.
     Why don't we go to this nice restaurant
     I know, talk over and times, get to
     know each other all over again.

                   RITA
     And then?

                 PUPKIN
     Well, tomorrow night I thought we'd
     go out again, talk some more, get to
     know each other even better.

                   RITA
     How much?

                 PUPKIN
     How much what?

                 RITA
     How much do we have to get to know
     each other?

                 PUPKIN
     I don't understand.

                 RITA
           (emphatically)
     How much do we have to get to know each
     other before we start talking about
     that job?

                 PUPKIN
     I'm not talking about any job.

                 RITA
     Then what's this big offer you were
     talking about?

                   PUPKIN
     You'll see.    Right now I'm asking you
     for a date.    How about it?

                 RITA
     I'm sorry, Rupert.     But I'm busy.

                   PUPKIN
     Busy?

                  RITA
     Yeah.   Busy.

                 PUPKIN
     But this is the biggest night of my life.

                 RITA
     I've already got a date.

The MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass.

                   MAN
     Rita!

RITA goes to the far end of the bar. She pours him another
beer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with
him. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He
raises his glass.

                  PUPKIN
     Miss!   Miss!

RITA returns to him.

                        PUPKIN
            Is that your date?

                        RITA
            None of your business.

                        PUPKIN
            What do you want to go out with him for?

                        RITA
            He's a good friend of mine.

                        PUPKIN
            Tell him you're busy.

                        RITA
            What's so important about tonight?

                          PUPKIN
            Everything!    You don't understand.

                        RITA
            No. I don't. It's been really nice
            seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping
            in. But I've got some work to do.

     RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar
     where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN
     sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john.

11   INT:   THE JOHN - NIGHT

     He enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three
     urinals. A moment later, the MAN enters. He goes to the
     nearest of the three urinals. The two men stare at the
     wall before them but the obvious tension between them
     renders them both incapable of relieving themselves.
     PUPKIN glances over at the MAN's face, then immediately
     turns back to the wall as the MAN turns to look at him.
     The MAN glances quickly at PUPKIN and then returns to
     staring at the wall. PUPKIN sneaks a furtive glance at
     the MAN's penis. The MAN sneaks a furtive glance at
     PUPKIN's penis.

                                     CUT TO:

12   INT:   THE BAR - NIGHT

     PUPKIN emerges from the john, followed a moment later by
     the MAN. They resume their seats at each end of the bar.
     A third MAN has come in and is seated midway between PUPKIN
     and the MAN.

                          PUPKIN
            Miss!

     RITA walks over reluctantly.

                 PUPKIN
     Listen to me for a second.

                 RITA
     I have work to do, Rupert.

                 PUPKIN
     Just listen. I'm at the start     of
     something really big. I don't     want
     to talk about it here but it's    going
     to happen soon and it's going    to be
     great -- for both of us.

                    RITA
     No kidding?

                 PUPKIN
     So see that guy some other night.

                    MAN
     Rita!

RITA turns to go.

                 PUPKIN
     But I haven't finished!

RITA returns to the MAN and pours him another beer. PUPKIN
sits for a few moments, then downs his beer quickly. Again,
he raises his glass.

                  PUPKIN
     Miss!   Miss!

The MAN leans over the bar and tells RITA something. She
opens a bottle of beer and hands it to the MAN who slides
it down the bar towards PUPKIN. As the beer reaches the
middle of the bar, the THIRD MAN seated midway between
PUPKIN and the MAN raises his beer glass to take a sip just
as the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand. The
bottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and
slides it back with equal force. At this moment, the THIRD
MAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed
the THIRD MAN's glass on the counter. The beer bottle
collides with the THIRD MAN's glass, creating a mess. RITA
glares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN. PUPKIN shrugs an
apology and RITA cleans up the mess.

                 RITA
           (to the THIRD MAN)
     I'll get you another one.

As RITA cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer, the MAN
walks down the bar towards PUPKIN. He leans over him and
puts a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder. PUPKIN
glances distastefully at the MAN's hand on him.

                    MAN

              (to PUPKIN)
     Look,    friend. I'm trying to have a
     nice    civilized conversation with the
     young    lady. Be a good little lad,
     huh,    and give us a break.

PUPKIN looks up at the MAN who pats him on the back in a
gesture of fraudulent friendship and menace. PUPKIN burps.
With an effort, the MAN controls his temper and returns to
his seat at the end of the bar. PUPKIN instantly raises
his glass.

                    PUPKIN
     Miss!     Miss!

The MAN advances towards PUPKIN with another bottle of
beer. PUPKIN watches passively as the MAN pours half the
bottle into PUPKIN's breast pocket and slams the half-empty
bottle on the counter. The MAN walks down to the end of
the counter where a smiling RITA is waiting.

PUPKIN again gulps his beer down. RITA and the MAN stare
at PUPKIN expecting him to raise his glass and call for
another beer. PUPKIN just sits there. After a few
moments, RITA and the MAN resume their conversation, but
they keep glancing over at PUPKIN, expecting him to
interrupt them with a call for beer at any moment. PUPKIN
continues to sit there. Just as RITA and the MAN have
settled back into their conversation, PUPKIN falls like a
stone from the barstool onto the floor. He lies
motionless. RITA and the MAN look at PUPKIN for a moment
while the handful of other patrons glance at him and return
to their drinks. RITA leaves the bar and goes to the rear
of the restaurant, disappearing into the kitchen. As she
does, the MAN walks over to where PUPKIN is lying inert
and prods him cruelly with his foot.

                 MAN
     C'mon, schmuck, wake up so I can
     kick your ass outta here.

The MAN turns to the kitchen to see if RITA is returning.
As he does, PUPKIN carefully opens one eye, grabs a free
chair from a nearby cocktail table, rises and bangs the MAN
smartly over the head. The MAN falls, out cold. PUPKIN
straightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with
interest. PUPKIN brushes off his suit, which is blue, just
like the MAN's, and stands above the MAN just as the MAN
stood above him, his back to kitchen. RITA emerges from
the kitchen with the owner, MR. NICHOLS and a large black
COOK.

                 RITA
           (to NICHOLS)
     He was making trouble one minute
     and the next he was on the floor.

RITA automatically reaches out as she talks for what she

     thinks is the MAN's arm. Instead, PUPKIN turns around
     smiling, leaving her too startled to speak. NICHOLS and
     the COOK lift the MAN to his feet.

                        COOK
            Okay, buddy, here we go.

     NICHOLS and the COOK lead the MAN, who is still groggy, out
     of the bar as RITA continues to stare at PUPKIN with a
     mixture of curiosity and amusement.

                        RITA
            Okay, Tarzan. Where do we eat tonight?

                                    CUT TO:

13   INT:   CHINESE RESTAURANT ON UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

     We are in the kitchen watching two dishes being chopped,
     shredded and boiled in deep fat. The activity is frantic.
     WE FOLLOW the two dishes as a WAITER carries them from the
     kitchen to a booth where PUPKIN and RITA are talking. It
     is a painfully plain restaurant, shaped in a rectangle,
     with booths lining either side and a row of little tables
     in between. At the back is the kitchen and two phone
     booths, facing each other. An old Chinese WOMAN mans the
     cash register by the door. The WAITER sets the dishes down
     before RITA and PUPKIN and clears an enormous plate of
     spare rib bones from RITA's place. RITA hands the WAITER
     her empty cocktail glass. RITA and PUPKIN are facing one
     another.

                        RITA
            Another one, Chan.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to WAITER)
            Chopsticks, please.

     The WAITER nods and leaves.

                        RITA
            So all this time you've been thinking
            about me, huh?

                        PUPKIN
            That's right, Rita.

                        RITA
            What kinds of things were you thinking?

     PUPKIN drops his eyes shyly.      RITA starts laughing.

                        RITA
            Oh, ho! Those kinds of things!    Shame
            on you, Rupert.

                       PUPKIN

     Rita, I assure you there was ...

                 RITA
     Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person!

                 PUPKIN
     Come on, Rita. People will hear.

                 RITA
           (in a whisper)
     Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person. Oh,
     come on, Rupert. Relax. Have a little fun.

WAITER arrives with RITA's drink and chopsticks and a beer
for PUPKIN.

                 PUPKIN
     This is a very important evening to me,
     Rita.

                 RITA
     Did you know your nose wiggled when
     you talked?

                   PUPKIN
     It does?

                 RITA
     Yeah. Just the tip. Like a rabbit.
     (pause) Hey, are we gonna eat or
     what? I'm starving.

PUPKIN serves RITA.

                 RITA
     It always looks like they put worms
     in this stuff.

                   PUPKIN
     Just taste.

RITA tastes.

                 RITA
     Well, I guess it won't kill me.

                 PUPKIN
     This is supposed to be the finest
     Cantonese cuisine in the city.

                 RITA
     Yeah? Then what happened to the
     tablecloths?

PUPKIN drops his eyes.

                 RITA
     Oh, don't worry about it.   This is

     fine. (She takes a long drink) I'm
     having a good time. So you've been
     devoted to me, huh?

                 PUPKIN
     I used to see you at the Garden
     every year.

                 RITA
     Oh, the Follies. That was the right
     name for 'em. How did you know which
     one was me? We all looked like chickens.
     What I mean is, we all looked like the
     same chicken. I thought it was gonna be
     Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I
     wind up looking like Henny Penny.

RITA chuckles to herself.

                 PUPKIN
     You just didn't get the breaks.

                 RITA
     Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't
     have the money for the right coach.
     But what difference does it make?

She starts laughing to herself.

                 RITA
     I remember once we were down in
     Atlanta and the ice machine broke
     down. We did three hours of slush.
     Everyone was falling on their faces
     and hopping up with their arms open
     for a bow like the whole thing was
     planned. And the people ate it up.

                 PUPKIN
     I liked the show.

                 RITA
     Yeah? The Follies? You really must
     have been carrying the torch. What
     did you think when I got married?
     You knew I got married?

                 PUPKIN
     I knew it wouldn't last.

                 RITA
     You think I should have married you,
     instead, huh?

                 PUPKIN
     Peter Drysdale!     Really, Rita!

                 RITA

     If he'd only been hit by a train.
     He was worth a helluva lot more dead
     than alive, I can tell you that.

RITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby,
talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking
young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of
beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA
smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG
MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes
over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the
scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the
YOUNG MAN.

                 PUPKIN
     Are you seeing anyone?

RITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her
looking at the YOUNG MAN.

                 RITA
     What do you mean?

                 PUPKIN
     I want to know about the competition,
     that's all.

                 RITA
     Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date
     with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And
     Thursday --- let's see --

                 PUPKIN
     I'm serious, Rita.

                 RITA
           (imitating him)
     I'm serious, Rita. (In her own voice)
     Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert.
     I see a lot of people.

                 PUPKIN
     Anyone special?

                 RITA
           (chuckling)
     You mean am I "going steady"?   Rupert,
     I'm thirty-one years old!

                 PUPKIN
     What about that guy tonight?

                 RITA
     Him?

                 PUPKIN
     Why him?

                 RITA
     What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit
     home watching TV? He's just some guy.
     He's got his own aluminum siding
     business. He comes into the city
     sometimes, that's all.

                 PUPKIN
     You don't go out with him for his
     money?!?

                 RITA
     Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do
     you think they pay me in that dump?
     Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get
     the world's greatest tippers in there
     either. Somebody has to take care of
     me.

                 PUPKIN
     That's what I want to talk to you
     about, Rita.

The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink.

                 PUPKIN
     Who's your favorite movie star?

                 RITA
     You are, Rupert.     Especially your nose.

                 PUPKIN
     Just tell me.

                 RITA
     Is this some kind of game? Are you
     going to tell me something about my
     character?

                   PUPKIN
     You'll see.    Give me his name.

                 RITA
     I can't think of anybody.

                 PUPKIN
     You've got to have one, Rita. Everybody
     does.

                 RITA
     Okay. Okay. Let's see.       (pause)
     Marilyn Monroe.

PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his
inside jacket pocket.

                   RITA
     Oh, Rupert!    Are we going to exchange

     phone numbers!?

PUPKIN expertly flips to a middle page in the book and,
keeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name,
he turns the book to RITA.

                 RITA
     That's her name.

                 PUPKIN
     Her name! She signed this herself,
     especially for me.

RITA starts flipping through the book, curious about the
other names. She isn't paying any attention to what PUPKIN
is saying.

                 PUPKIN
     She wasn't a great actress but she had
     a real gift for comedy. She died
     tragically, you know, alone, like so
     many of the world's most beautiful
     women. I'm going to see that doesn't
     happen to you, Rita.

                 RITA
     Who's this one?

PUPKIN checks the book.

                 PUPKIN
     Burt Reynolds.

                 RITA
     Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes.
     Who's this?

                   PUPKIN
     Mel Brooks.

                   RITA
     And this?

                 PUPKIN
     Carol Burnett.

                   RITA
     No kidding.    How about this?

                 PUPKIN
     Glenda Jackson.

                 RITA
     Never heard of her.

                 PUPKIN
           (pointing to other names)
     And that's Woody Allen and there's

     Ernie Kovacs -- he's dead -- and that
     one's Lauren Bacall.

                 RITA
     You don't really know any of these
     people?

                 PUPKIN
     Take a look at this.

PUPKIN flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to
RITA.

                 RITA
           (squinting)
     I can't make it out.

                  PUPKIN
     Try.

                 RITA
     This is really weird handwriting!

Exasperated, PUPKIN follows the name in question with his
index finger.

                 PUPKIN
     Rooooper ....

                 RITA
           (guessing)
     Redford!

                 PUPKIN
     That's Robert Redford.

                  RITA
     It is?

                   PUPKIN
     No!    It's ... it's Rupert Pupkin

PUPKIN tears out the page and hands it to her shyly.   RITA
just stares at it and back at PUPKIN.

                 PUPKIN
     Don't lose it. It's going to be worth
     something in a couple of weeks.

RITA start laughing.

                 PUPKIN
     That's what I've been trying to tell
     you. Things are really breaking for
     me. I'm ticketed for stardom.

RITA laughs harder, despite efforts to be serious.

                 PUPKIN
     Only a couple of hours ago, I was
     talking to Jerry Langford, the Jerry
     Langford. Stop it, Rita!

RITA pulls herself together for a moment.

                 PUPKIN
     We were talking about my doing my act
     on his show.

                 RITA
           (suppressing a smile)
     Your act?

                    PUPKIN
     Get    that guy you knew from Clifton out
     of    your head right now. You're looking
     at    Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert Pupkin,
     the    new King of Comedy.

RITA starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself.

                 RITA
           (getting a grip on herself)
     I'm sorry.

                 PUPKIN
     Why not me, Rita? A guy can always
     get what he wants if he's willing to
     pay the price. All it takes is a
     little talent and sacrifice and the
     right break. If you've got a friend
     in the right place, that's all it
     takes. And that's exactly what I
     have going for me right now. After
     all, crazier things have happened.

RITA listens silently for a moment, then begins to giggle.
As PUPKIN resumes speaking, we CUT between RITA and the
YOUNG MAN. Their flirtation picks up steam. The YOUNG MAN
raises his eyebrows as if to ask, "Are you interested in
me?" She smiles. All the while, PUPKIN rattles on.

                 PUPKIN
     You just don't realize what a shot on
     the Langford Show can mean. That's
     coast to coast, national TV, a bigger
     audience than the greatest comedians
     used to play to in a lifetime. A shot
     like that means a free ticket on the
     comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week,
     Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or
     Carol Burnett. And you've always got
     those other talk shows to fall back on
     -- Carson, Griffin. And all that leads
     straight in one direction, Rita --
     Hollywood! That's when we really start

     living. How does this sound to you --
     a beach house in Malibu, right on the
     ocean. You'll get a beautiful tan,
     believe me. And we'd keep a suite at
     the Sherry. That's the only place to
     stay when you're big. We could get
     something on a top floor and look down
     on all our old friends in Clifton and
     just laugh. How does that sound to you?

                 RITA
     It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I
     really hope you get what you want.
     But it's getting late and I'm a working
     girl. You know what I mean?

The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing.
A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it.

                 PUPKIN
     You going to spend the rest of your
     life in that place? Is that what you
     really want, talking about nothing with
     nothings? I thought you wanted something
     a little better than that and that's what
     I'm offering. Every King needs a Queen,
     Rita. I want you to be mine. What do
     you say?

                 RITA
     You really want to help me out? You
     see this. (She points to her lower
     back molar) A hundred seventy-five
     bucks. If you could spare fifty, say,
     until next Monday, that would keep
     three people really happy -- me, my
     landlord and my dentist.

During RITA's speech, the WAITER has been working his way
from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant.

                 WAITER
     Telephone for you, Miss.

                 RITA
           (looking puzzled)
     Me? Nobody knows I'm here.   You didn't
     tell anybody, did you?

                 PUPKIN
     No.

                 RITA
           (getting up)
     What the hell's going on?

CAMERA FOLLOWS RITA, who walks to the back of the
restaurant and picks up the dangling receiver in one of

     the two facing booths, the other of which is occupied.

14   INT:   THE PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

                        RITA
            Hello?

                        MAN'S VOICE
            Hi.

                        RITA
            Who is this?

                        MAN'S VOICE
            Who do you think it is? I've been
            staring at you all evening.

                        RITA
            Where are you?

     The YOUNG MAN taps forcefully with his index finger on the
     glass door of his booth. RITA, hearing the noise, turns
     around and finds herself staring at the YOUNG MAN. She
     smiles.

                                      CUT TO:

15   INT:   THE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     PUPKIN at the table looking over the check. He gets out a
     ten dollar bill. RITA emerges from the booth in nervous
     high spirits.

                        RITA
                  (with repressed gaiety)
            You know who that was -- the bar.       I
            have to go back to work.

                        PUPKIN
            How did they know you were here?

                        RITA
                  (gathering her things)
            I guess I must have told them.      They
            need someone right away.

                        PUPKIN
                  (accusingly)
            You don't even care, do you?

                         RITA
            Oh, no.   I do. Really!

                        PUPKIN
            It's not the bar, Rita.    Don't tell
            me it's the bar.

                        RITA

            Don't be angry. It has nothing to
            do with you. I had a nice dinner,
            really. It was great seeing you
            again.

     PUPKIN stare at her icily.

                          RITA
            Come on.    Let's see a smile.

                        PUPKIN
            Why don't we finish the evening up
            at the bar together? End the evening
            where it began?

                        RITA
            After what happened there?

                        PUPKIN
            Well, I could at least drop you off!

                        RITA
                  (hurriedly making up her face)
            That's okay. Really. I can manage.
            Why don't you just go to a movie or
            something? Don't let me spoil your
            evening.

                        PUPKIN
            But that wouldn't be right.

     RITA gets up and stands before PUPKIN.

                        RITA
                  (firmly)
            Look, Rupert. It's been a lot of fun,
            really. I'll see you sometime, huh?

                         PUPKIN
            But Rita!

     RITA starts moving towards the door.

                        RITA
            Come on, Rupert.      I'm in a hurry.

     RITA marches out with PUPKIN trailing behind. He throws
     the check and the ten dollar bill at the CASHIER.

16   EXT.   THE STREET - NIGHT

     CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN as he streaks out the door and jumps
     into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the
     street. He spies the YOUNG MAN and RITA walking about
     three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping
     out of sight. They turn occasionally to see if he's
     around, then stop turning. They go around the corner and
     disappear into a large apartment building. PUPKIN rushes

     after them,   positioning himself across from    the building.
     He searches   the windows for some clue as to    where they
     have gone.    Finally a set of lights go on on    the fourth
     floor and a   MAN's shadow is seen closing two    sets of
     blinds.

                                    CUT TO:

17   INT:   THE APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER - NIGHT

     PUPKIN enters the building and finds himself in a small
     entranceway. The door to the lobby is locked. Next to
     the door, on the wall, are listed the tenants, their
     apartment numbers and a button next to each name. There is
     an intercom speaker. There are eight apartments listed on
     the fourth floor, running from 4A to 4H. PUPKIN looks them
     over, takes a deep breath and pushes 4A.

                                    CUT TO:

18   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     It is an extremely well-furnished studio apartment with all
     the requirements of a contemporary bachelor pad -- an
     imitation bearskin rug, nice bookshelves including an
     elaborate stereo system, recessed lighting, including a
     soft spotlight on the Queen-sized bed with its pseudo-satin
     cover. The YOUNG MAN and RITA stand in the middle of the
     room. RITA looks about uneasily. No intercom buzzer sounds.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Welcome to the pleasure dome.

                        RITA
            You don't kid around, do you?

                        YOUNG MAN
                  (smiling)
            I do alright. What's your libation?

                        RITA
            Huh?

                        YOUNG MAN
            Your potion. Your drink.

                        RITA
            Bourbon and soda.   Make it light.

     The YOUNG MAN goes to his chic little bar and starts fixing
     RITA a strong bourbon and soda. He also fixes himself a
     strong scotch and water. As he works, they talk.

                        YOUNG MAN
            You from the South?

                        RITA
            Me?

                        YOUNG MAN
            That's what Southern people drink.
            Lots of bourbon.

                        RITA
            What do people from Jersey drink?

                        YOUNG MAN
            I make it a point to study things
            like that. It's important to know
            people's backgrounds, their tastes,
            their culture. It gives you a little
            head start.

     The YOUNG MAN turns from the bar and hands RITA her drink.

                           YOUNG MAN
            I'm Chet. Whom do I have the
            pleasure of serving?

                          RITA
            I'm Mary.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Pleased to meat you, Mary. (He lifts
            his glass) To our evening.

                          PUPKIN
            Rita Keane.    I want to talk to her.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE
            Rita Keane?

                        PUPKIN
            That's right. Oh, never mind.      I
            must have the wrong apartment.

                        WOMAN'S VOICE
            There's no Rita here.

                           PUPKIN
            I know.     I know. I'm sorry to bother
            you.

                        WOMAN'S VOICE
            You must have the wrong apartment.

20   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     RITA is seated on the couch. The YOUNG MAN is putting a
     record on the phonograph. Once again, the intercom doesn't
     sound. PUPKIN has drawn another blank.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Leisure is America's fastest growing
            industry. Did you know that? Think
            about it. Short work weeks, more
            vacation. People need something to
            do with all that time and that's where
            I come in. Leisure Villages, Inc.
            We buy land an hour or so outside
            your metropolitan centers. We set
            up the bungalows, dig some lakes, lay
            out a golf course, you know, fix the
            whole place up so it's usable. Then
            young, personable guys like me show
            the people around. It the guy seems
            tight, we point out the investment
            factor. If he's a swinger, well,
            the bungalows are very private. If
            he's a sports nut, we talk up skiing
            and fishing and tennis.

     The phonograph starts playing Burt Bachrach.

                        YOUNG MAN
            What's your work, Mary?

     The YOUNG MAN walks back to her and stands over her.

                         RITA
            Me.   I fly for National.

                        YOUNG MAN

            No kidding?

            What's that smell?

                        YOUNG MAN
            Sandalwood incense. It seemed very
            you.

22   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     RITA and the YOUNG MAN are seated on the couch. Still no
     buzzer. As the YOUNG MAN talks, RITA is staring at a
     woman's shoe lying underneath a small table that holds a
     lamp.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Did you know that you have remarkable
            hair?

                        RITA
            Yeah? You know what?       I feel like
            going to a movie.

                         YOUNG MAN
            Now?

                       RITA
            Sure. Why not? It's only twenty of
            ten. We can make a ten o'clock show.

     The YOUNG MAN takes her hands and looks deep into her eyes.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Why don't we make our own movie?

                          RITA
            No.    I don't think so.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Don't be so uptight. Give it a chance.

            I want to go to the movies, that's all.

                        YOUNG MAN
            We can go to the movies later.

     RITA pulls her hands away.

                        RITA
            Let's stop playing games, okay.
            I'm not a kid.

                        YOUNG MAN
            You have something against pleasure?

                         RITA

            I'm just not interested in being
            tonight's ritual sacrifice, okay?

                        YOUNG MAN

     RITA shakes her head.

            What exactly did you think we were

24   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The YOUNG MAN is practically sitting on RITA's lap.   He
     has RITA backed up against the end of the couch.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Look, if you've got sexual problems
            let's talk about them. It helps
            clear the air.

                        RITA
            There's nothing wrong with me.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Then it's me?

                        RITA
            I don't even know you.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Then find out. Sex is a great way
            of breaking down barriers.

                        RITA
            I don't think so.

                        YOUNG MAN
            I'm sure this could lead to something
            beautiful.

     The YOUNG MAN kisses RITA roughly.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Passive resistance, huh?

                        RITA
            Let's just write this thing off as
            a big mistake. What do you say?

                        YOUNG MAN
            What's wrong with me?

                         RITA
            Nothing.   I just want to go home.

                        YOUNG MAN
            I can see I'm not turning you on.

                        RITA

                        RITA
            You really want to know?

                        YOUNG MAN
            Yeah.

                        RITA
            How can I put it? Well, it's like
            you've got your fly open and your

     undo her blouse. She is desperate.

                        YOUNG MAN
            Afterwards, you'll thank me.

     The buzzer sounds with great force.        It is one, long,

     protracted blast that breaks the YOUNG MAN's concentration.
     RITA takes advantage of the distraction to grab her bag
     and rush out as the buzzer continues to sound.

     EXIT door next to the elevator and comes rushing towards
     him. She is numb and emotionally exhausted.

                       PUPKIN

            What do you want?

     RITA keeps walking out of the entranceway and onto the
     street. PUPKIN is at her side.

                        PUPKIN
            Don't be angry with me.     I was worried
            about you, that's all.

                        RITA
            Just go home and leave me alone.

     PUPKIN take off his jacket and puts if around RITA's
     shoulders.

                        PUPKIN
                  (quietly)
            Here. You'll need this.      It's getting
            chilly.

                        RITA
            I'm so bad.   I'm such a dummy.

                        PUPKIN
            Don't say that, Rita.     Everyone
            does crazy things.

                        RITA
            Not all the time.

            I'll get us a cab.

     NIGHT

     WE SEE the taxi pull up in front of one of those middle-

class tenements -- a fairly well-preserved six-story
building with a fire escape running up the front. PUPKIN
helps RITA out of the taxi. A dime bounces at PUPKIN's
feet.

                 CAB DRIVER'S VOICE
     Stuff it, big spender!

PUPKIN pays no attention.   He walks RITA to her front
stoop.

                 RITA
     Well, I guess you're entitled to come
     up for coffee.

                 PUPKIN
     That's okay, Rita. You're tired and
     I know I'm not always the easiest guy
     to be with.

There is a pause.

                 RITA
           (puzzled)
     What do you want, Rupert?

                 PUPKIN
           (softly)
     You don't understand anything, do you?
     I love you, Rita. I want to change
     your life ... if you'll only give me a
     chance.

RITA just shakes her head sadly.

                 PUPKIN
     Look, what if I arranged it so you
     could meet Jerry? You'd have to
     believe me if you heard it from him.

                 RITA
     There's no ...

                 PUPKIN
     I'll arrange that, Rita. We'll all
     go out to dinner some night or maybe
     out to his place, on a weekend. You'll
     see. The trouble with you is you've
     got no faith. Now go to bed and get a
     good rest and I'll see you in a couple
     of days.

PUPKIN gives RITA a very gentle, sweet kiss on the
forehead.

                 PUPKIN
           (gently)
     Now run along in.

     RITA just stares at him.

                        PUPKIN
            Go on.

     RITA turns slowly and goes in.       She looks back.   PUPKIN is
     gone.

     PUPKIN hands the RECEPTIONIST the package.

                        PUPKIN
            I need somebody to sign. You can sign
            anything you want -- Cary Grant, Art
            Carney, I don't care.

     The RECEPTIONIST signs.

                        PUPKIN
            Would you mind very much if I used
            your phone? It's local.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            Don't be, long. Dial nine.

     PUPKIN takes out a little piece of paper from his suit

     A SHOT of the clock on the Allied Chemical Building. It
     reads 10:10. A nearby record store starts blasting music
     into the street through a loudspeaker. The music serves
     as background for a montage in which we CUT BETWEEN the
     clock, which moves in bites towards 11:30 to Broadway as
     it looks to PUPKIN in the booth -- that cavalcade of
     hustlers, whores, housewives, kids, weirdos and working
     people; and SHOTS of various people waiting to use the
     phone -- their impatience, anger, disgust. Each time one
     of them arrives, PUPKIN pretends to thumb through the phone
     book and dial a number. WE WATCH him chatting with
     animation until the waiting party leaves. Then WE SEE him
     push the coin return to retrieve his dime. Finally, PUPKIN
     takes a last look at the clock.   WE SEE that it reads
     11:30. He leaves the booth and goes to the trash basket.
     His packages have been swiped.

            You know the secret of dieting, Jerry?
            Grapefruit. It's good for you. It's
            filling. And it's low in calories.

                        LANGFORD
                  (to the camera)
            Take note of that, you ladies.

                        PUPKIN
            As a matter of fact, yesterday I went
            to the outdoor market near where I
            live and I bought twenty grapefruit.
            The grocer looked at me and said,
            "What are you gonna do with all those?"
            So I bent over and told him (in a
            confidential tone) "I'm gonna take 'em
            back to Florida and set 'em free!"

     LANGFORD and the AUDIENCE laugh heartily.

                  (holding the phone and
                  talking to PUPKIN)
            I'm sorry, Mr. Pupkin, but Mr. Langford's
            secretary has no record of any appointment.

                          PUPKIN
            Pardon me?

            Mr. Langford's secretary has no
            record of any appointment.

                        PUPKIN
            Well, technically speaking, I don't
            actually have an appointment. Jerry
            asked me to call him today and when
            I couldn't get through, I thought ...

     As PUPKIN talks, a VISITOR has entered and stands behind
     him waiting for the RECEPTIONIST's attention.

                           RECEPTIONIST
            I see.     (Into the phone) He says Mr.
            Langford    asked him to call. (To
            PUPKIN)     Mr. Langford's secretary wants
            to know    what this is in reference to.

     The RECEPTIONIST glances past PUPKIN to the VISITOR
     waiting.

                        RECEPTIONIST
                  (to PUPKIN)
            Would you mind talking to her yourself?

     The RECEPTIONIST hands the phone to PUPKIN and occupies
     herself with the VISITOR.

                        PUPKIN
            Hello? ... Jerry and I discussed
            my being on the show last night and
            he told me to call ... No. I don't
            mind.

     PUPKIN hands the phone back to the RECEPTIONIST.

                        PUPKIN
            I'm supposed to wait.

     The RECEPTIONIST listens to the phone for a moment and then
     hangs up. The VISITOR has just disappeared into the back
     offices. PUPKIN stands there, smiling politely at the
     RECEPTIONIST who returns a professional smile.

                        PUPKIN
            Who was that gentleman?     (PUPKIN

     he is referring to the VISITOR)

                 RECEPTIONIST
     Mr. Gangemi.

PUPKIN draws a complete blank but wants to appear
knowledgeable.

                  PUPKIN
     Oh, I see.   Mr. Gangemi.

                 RECEPTIONIST
     He takes care of our air conditioning.

CATHY LONG emerges from the back offices. She is a tall,
modishly-dressed, attractive woman in her early thirties.

                 CATHY LONG
     Uh ... Mr. Pupkin?

                  PUPKIN
     Yes?

                 CATHY LONG
     I'm Cathy Long.

                 PUPKIN
     I'm Mr. Pupkin.

                 CATHY LONG
     Can I help you?

                 PUPKIN
     I'm sorry, but you are?

                 CATHY LONG
     I'm Bert Thomas' assistant.

                 PUPKIN
     Bert Thomas?

                 CATHY LONG
     He's our executive producer.

                 PUPKIN
     Oh, yes. I'm sure he is. But, you
     see, I've already talked directly
     with Jerry about my being on the show
     and he told me to get in touch with
     him. I'm just here to follow up on
     that.

                 CATHY LONG
     What do you do, Mr. Pupkin?

                  PUPKIN

     Stand-up comedy.

                   CATHY LONG
     Fine.    Where are you working?

                 PUPKIN
     Well, right now I'm developing new
     material.

                 CATHY    LONG
     I see. Well, as     soon as you start
     performing again,    let us know where
     you are and I'll    send my assistant
     down to check you    out.

                 PUPKIN
     Sure. Sure. But that's not necessary,
     Miss Long. Jerry and I already went
     over all this.

                 CATHY LONG
     Does Jerry know your work?

                   PUPKIN
             (nodding)
     Yes.    I don't think he does.

                 CATHY LONG
     You don't happen to have a tape or a
     demo that we might listen to?

                 PUPKIN
     Oh, sure. I've got lots of tapes.
     That's no problem.

                 CATHY LONG
     Good. Why don't you just send one
     to us and I assure you we'll listen
     to it promptly.

                 PUPKIN
     Great. I'll do that. I can see
     that'd be a lot easier for Jerry.
     Thanks a lot, Miss Long.

                 CATHY LONG
     Don't mention it, Mr. Pupkin.     Now,
     if you'd excuse me ...

                   PUPKIN
     Sure.    Sure. Thanks again.

CATHY LONG leaves. PUPKIN, left standing there, smiles at
the RECEPTIONIST who returns another professional smile.

                 PUPKIN
           (to the RECEPTIONIST)
     Thanks.

42   EXT:   THE UPPER-BROADWAY HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

     PUPKIN comes out of the building elated. He is immediately
     confronted by MARSHA. PUPKIN continues to walk as MARSHA
     skips beside him.

                        MARSHA
            I've got to speak to you for a minute.
            I'm Marsha.

                         PUPKIN
            Yeah.   I know.

                        MARSHA
            Look. Did Jerry say anything about
            me last night?

                        PUPKIN
            I'm really in a hurry, Marsha ...

                        MARSHA
            Was he angry? ... In the car last night,
            I saw you. Did he talk about me?

                        PUPKIN
            I thought that was you.     That was
            some stunt.

                        MARSHA
            What did he say?

                        PUPKIN
            We didn't talk about you.

                        MARSHA
            You know Jerry?

                        PUPKIN
            Yeah.

     MARSHA thrusts an envelope into PUPKIN's hands.

                        MARSHA
            Give him this for me.

                        PUPKIN
            Why don't you ...

                        MARSHA
            Because I can't! Please. I need
            your help. You'll be my friend forever.
            Come on. I'll buy you something.
            What do you want?

     She takes a great messy bunch of bills out of her raincoat

     pockets and jams them into PUPKIN's hands.

                        PUPKIN
            I don't want this.

                         MARSHA
            Take it.   I can get all I want.

     PUPKIN shrugs and pockets the money.

                         PUPKIN
            Okay.   I'll try.

                        MARSHA
                  (turning cold)
            Don't try. Do it.       Remember.   We
            just made a deal.

     PUPKIN stares at the envelope.

                        MARSHA
            And don't open it.    It's private.

                         PUPKIN
            Okay.   Okay.

                        MARSHA
            How soon can you get it to him?

                        PUPKIN
            I don't know. Couple a days.

                        MARSHA
                  (menacingly)
            You'd better.

      MARSHA turns and walks in the direction from which they
      came. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN who walks on for a block or
      so, then opens the envelope. It contains a set of
      apartment keys, a scrap of hand-knitted woolen cloth and a
      note in lipstick that reads: "I've made you a sweater,
      honey. Come try it on. I miss you. Love, M. 74 East
      83rd Street, Apartment 2B!" He takes out the money
MARSHA
      gave him. There are wads of tens, twenties and fifties
      with a sprinkling of fives and ones.

44   EXT:   A TIMES SQUARE HOTEL - DAY

     The hotel is just one step up from a flophouse. WE SEE
     PUPKIN enter.

                                     CUT TO:

45   INT:   PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY

PUPKIN enters. WE SEE that it is a small room, furnished
by the hotel in the plainest way. Nicely-done home-made
collages of show business figures decorate the drab green
walls. The room is neat and clean. PUPKIN goes directly
to a plain table which holds two tape recorders -- one a
small cassette the other a large table tape recorder. He
picks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into
it.

                  PUPKIN
     Testing.   Testing.   Testing.

In the following montage, we hear in the background the
replay of his "testing, testing testing" and various
other noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of
laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward,
a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At the
same time, the CAMERA PANS about the room.    We look
at the collages which include all the obvious show business
figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin
and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages
also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia
Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford
Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special
Kennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black,
Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a
trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray.
There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford
in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters,
Carson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable
library of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians,
treasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores
of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked,
i.e., "LANGFORD MONOLOGUES:    7/5/72 to 9/9/72." "MISC.
MONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69."

                              CUT TO:

PUPKIN sitting before the tape recorder lost in thought.
Finally, he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike.

                 PUPKIN
     First, Miss Long. Thanks very much
     for your help at the office and for
     passing this along to Jerry. I
     appreciate it more than you know.

PUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few
beats. He then starts the large recorder.

                 PUPKIN
     Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just
     want to thank you for listening to
     this material and for the opportunity
     that you've given me. You know, lots
     of people think that guys like you,
     you know, people who have made it,
     lose their feeling for struggling

     young talent such as myself. But
     now I know from experience that those
     people are just cynics, embittered
     by their own failure. I know, Jerry,
     that you're as human as the rest of us,
     if not more so. (pause) Oh well, I
     guess there's no point going on about
     it. You know how I feel. So let's get
     on with the show.   The best of Rupert
     Pupkin! I've sketched out this little
     introduction in order to save you a
     little time. So close your eyes and
     imagine it's exactly six o'clock.
     You're standing in the wings and we
     hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike
     up your theme song.

PUPKIN pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the
theme song of the Jerry Langford Show, followed by the
voice of BERT CANTER, the announcer.

                 BERT CANTER'S VOICE
     And now, direct from New York, it's
     the Jerry Langford Show! Tonight,
     with Jerry's special guest ...

PUPKIN deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his
own voice for that of CANTER's. The large tape recorder
keeps rolling.

                 PUPKIN
     ... the comedy find of the year making
     his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the
     King of Comedy!

PUPKIN rapidly races the cassette tape forward, then pushes
down the "play" button. We hear a burst of thundering
applause. PUPKIN lets the applause run for a while and
then shuts it off. The large recorder keeps rolling.

                 PUPKIN
     Now you come on, Jerry, and do your
     monologue. Then, when the time comes,
     this is how I see you introducing me.
     You'll say something like this.
     "Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to
     do something a little bit different
     tonight. It isn't often that you can
     call someone a sure thing in the
     entertainment business. After all,
     the verdict is always in your hands.
     But I think after you've met my next
     guest, that you'll agree with me that
     he's destined for greatness. So,
     now, will you please give your warmest
     welcome to the newest King of Comedy,
     Rupert Pupkin!!!"

     PUPKIN pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous
     burst of applause. PUPKIN lets it run, listening intently.
     He stands up and faces a wall of his room, still holding
     the microphone. WE SEE that the wall is covered by a huge
     blow-up of an audience laughing and applauding.

45   INT:   THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

     WE SEE a real audience laughing and applauding.

                                    CUT TO:

     PUPKIN strides triumphantly onto the stage, nodding to
     acknowledge the applause. He stops center stage as the
     television cameras maneuver about him.

                                    CUT TO:

     A SHOT of the "APPLAUSE" sign flashing, then stopping.
     Still, the applause goes on.

                                    CUT TO:

     PUPKIN    raises his hands to quiet the audience. After a few
     moments    the applause dies down, except for a pair of hands
     in the    center of the orchestra. PUPKIN peers out to see
     who is    still applauding.

                                    CUT TO:

     RITA, in the middle of the audience, applauds
     enthusiastically.

                                    CUT TO:

     PUPKIN on stage.    PUPKIN gives RITA a special smile and
     nod.

                        PUPKIN
            Will somebody tell that lovely lady
            that the applause sign is off.

     The audience laughs.

                                    CUT TO:

46   INT:   PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY

     PUPKIN stands facing the "audience" still holding the mike.

                        PUPKIN
            That's a possible introduction, Jerry.
            Now let's move on to my act.

                                    CUT TO:

47   INT:   THE RECEPTION AREA OF THE LANGFORD SHOW - DAY

     PUPKIN is pacing. He is wearing another suit, this one a
     broad-lapelled-grey. He is freshly shaved, is hair neatly
     combed, his shoes carrying a bright shine. He clutches a
     small flat box, neatly wrapped with the words 'FOR JERRY
     LANGFORD" written clearly across the top in large print.
     CATHY LONG emerges from one of the back corridors into the
     reception area.

                        CATHY LONG
            Yes?

                        PUPKIN
                  (suddenly a bit shy)
            I didn't want to take any chances
            with this ... uh ... Miss Long, so I
            ... uh ... thought I'd just bring it
            here myself.

     He hands CATHY LONG the package as though it contained
     nitroglycerine.

                        CATHY LONG
            We talked about this this morning,
            did we, Mr. ... ?

                         PUPKIN
            Pupkin.   Rupert Pupkin.

                        CATHY LONG
            Oh, yes. It's been some day. (pause)
            Well, I certainly appreciate your
            bringing this over, Mr. Pupkin, and
            we'll listen to it as soon as possible.

                        PUPKIN
            Fine. Er ... you don't have any idea
            how soon that might be?

                        CATHY LONG
            Well, you can try checking with us
            tomorrow. We might know something
            by then. Otherwise, it'll have to
            be Monday.

                        PUPKIN
            What if I just sort of waited around
            here today, just in case? I'll stay
            out of the way.

                        CATHY LONG
            You'd just be wasting your time,
            Mr. Pupkin. We won't know anything
            until tomorrow at the earliest.

                        PUPKIN
            Oh, I wouldn't consider it a waste of

            time at all.    I'd be glad to do it.

                        CATHY LONG
            Look, why don't you try us tomorrow.
            Okay?

                        PUPKIN
            Tomorrow? ... Right. I'll do that.
            Thanks a lot, Miss Long. And thank
            Jerry.

     CATHY LONG smiles at     PUPKIN and    goes, leaving PUPKIN
     staring at a picture     of LANGFORD    on the wall. WE FIX on
     LANGFORD a moment and     PULL BACK    to see LANGFORD in what
     PUPKIN would imagine     his office    to be.

48   INT:   AN OFFICE - DAY

     A large, corner office furnished in royal red, with high
     ceilings and a huge desk. Potted palms and hydrangeas rest
     on a marble floor. LANGFORD is moving about restlessly,
     clutching PUPKIN's tape in one hand and waving it about.
     PUPKIN is seated on a comfortable couch.

                          LANGFORD
            Dynamite!    This is dynamite!

                        PUPKIN
                  (shyly)
            You think so, Jerry?

                        LANGFORD
            Look, I've been at this for fifteen
            years, Rupert, and I haven't come up
            with anything like this -- not me,
            not any of my writers.

                        PUPKIN
                  (smiling with obvious
                  pleasure)
            Well, I'm glad you like it, Jerry.

                        LANGFORD
            Tell me something, Rube. (pause)
            How do you do it? I'm not asking
            to use the material myself. I just
            want to know how you (LANGFORD waves
            his arms in a gesture of frustration)
            how you do it.

                        PUPKIN
            Well, I don't know if I can explain
            it, really.

                          LANGFORD
            Come on.    Try, Rube.

                         PUPKIN

            Well,    it just sort of comes. I think
            about    my life, see, mainly about the
            worst    parts, all the awful things, and
            I just    try to see them in a funny light.
            That's    all.

                        LANGFORD
                  (eagerly)
            Is that what you do? The worst parts,
            and then you look at them in a funny
            light? Is that what you do?

                        PUPKIN
            More or less. It's hard to describe
            how its happens.

                        LANGFORD
            But that's just it, Rube. It doesn't
            happen for me. Why do you think the
            show is in so much trouble? By the
            time I've done my monologue, everyone
            has switched to Carson. Maybe if you
            did a little writing ... ?

                        PUPKIN
            Sure, Jerry, I'd do anything I could
            to help out.

                        LANGFORD
            You would? Great. Why don't you
            come out to my place this weekend
            and we'll hash it out. I'm having
            a few of my friends but we should be
            able to get a little work in.

                        PUPKIN
            Would you mind if I brought someone?

                        LANGFORD
                  (smiling)
            A girl, Rube?

                        PUPKIN
            A very special girl, Jerry.

                        LANGFORD
            I'd love to meet her.

49   THE HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING ON UPPER BROADWAY - DAY

     PUPKIN emerges, lost in thought. Suddenly he notices
     MARSHA waiting nearby. She doesn't see PUPKIN. He sneaks
     off.

                                      CUT TO:

50   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - DAY

     It is a bright morning. LANGFORD, attempting to camouflage
     himself by wearing a cap over his eyes and his trench coat
     collar turned up, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses,
     walks out of the building. A DOORMAN is standing by the
     door.

                          DOORMAN
            Cab, Jerry?

                        LANGFORD
            That's alright, thanks.

     WE FOLLOW LANGFORD as he walks. Some people don't notice.
     Others stare but leave him alone, a few commenting to their
     companions and pointing at him. A CAB DRIVER pulls
     alongside.

                        DRIVER
            Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing
            and juggle at the same time. How
            about puttin' him on your show?

     LANGFORD keeps walking.

                        DRIVER
            How about it, Jerry?

                        LANGFORD
            Sorry, I'm off duty.

51   EXT.   A MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

     LANGFORD stands at the corner, next to a middle-aged
     COUPLE.

                        WOMAN
            You're Jerry!!

     LANGFORD pulls his cap a little more tightly around his
     eyes.

                        WOMAN
            You know something.   (She giggles)
            I undress in front of you every night
            and Larry here doesn't mind at all.

                        LARRY
            I can't get anything started with her
            until you're off the air. Your show
            is ruining my sex life, Jerry.

                        LANGFORD
            Well then, you'll just have to put
            on a better show than I do.

     DAY

     WE WATCH LANGFORD continue to walk, feeling what it is to
     be a celebrity out in public. After a few beats, we

                                      CUT TO:

53   EXT:   BROADWAY - DAY

     WE SEE MARSHA trailing LANGFORD. LANGFORD notices her and
     starts walking quickly. MARSHA walks quickly. LANGFORD
     starts jogging. MARSHA starts jogging. Finally, LANGFORD
     breaks into a sprint. MARSHA runs after him. LANGFORD
     disappears into his office building. MARSHA arrives
     several seconds later.

                           MARSHA
            Jerry!     God damnit!

     Just as MARSHA turns around, PUPKIN, unaware of her, walks
     cheerfully into the building.

54   INT:   RECEPTION AREA OF JERRY LANGFORD SHOW OFFICES - DAY

     PUPKIN enters. The same middle-aged, plump RECEPTIONIST
     is seated behind the desk.

                           RECEPTIONIST
            Yes, sir?     (recognizing him)   Oh, hi.

                         PUPKIN
            Hi.   How are you?

                          RECEPTIONIST
            Not bad.

                          PUPKIN
            I'm fine.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            Can I help you?

                        PUPKIN
            I'd like to see Jerry, please.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            You are ... ?

                          PUPKIN
            Mr. Pupkin.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            Just a minute.

The RECEPTIONIST dials a number.

                 RECEPTIONIST
     Mr. Pupkin is here ... That's right
     ... (to PUPKIN) She'll be with you
     in a minute.

                   PUPKIN
     Who?

                   RECEPTIONIST
     Miss Long.

                 PUPKIN
     But I wanted to see Jerry.

                 RECEPTIONIST
     Mr. Langford's not in. Miss Long
     will take care of you.

                   PUPKIN
     Alright.

PUPKIN paces for a few beats. He smiles at the
RECEPTIONIST. A beat later, CATHY LONG comes out,
carrying the tape in its box.

                   CATHY LONG
     Mr. Pupkin?

                 PUPKIN
     How are you today?

                 CATHY LONG
     Fine, Mr. Pupkin. Thank you for
     your tape. We listened to it with
     great interest. And, frankly, Mr. Pupkin,
     we saw a lot of good things in what
     you're doing. We feel you have good
     potential. Very good potential.

                 PUPKIN
           (smiling)
     Thanks.

                 CATHY LONG
     That's why I'll be honest with you,
     Mr. Pupkin ...

                   PUPKIN
     Yes?

                 CATHY LONG
     We just don't think you're ready yet.

                 PUPKIN
           (baffled)
     Not ready?

            CATHY LONG
Well, we just don't feel right now
that you're right for Jerry.

            PUPKIN
      (rapidly, half-listening)
Right for Jerry. Sure.

            CATHY LONG
Some of the material ... some of the
one-liners, for instance ...

            PUPKIN
Yes?

            CATHY LONG
... were not very strong.

            PUPKIN
You didn't care for some of the jokes,
is that it?

            CATHY LONG
That"s right.

            PUPKIN
Good. Good. I can take care of
that right way. Thanks. Just tell
me the ones you think should go.
That would be a big help. (to the
RECEPTIONIST) This is great. (to
CATHY LONG) Which ones?

            CATHY LONG
Well, it's not just that, Mr. Pupkin.
You see, Jerry likes to panel his
guests, you know, chat with them
afterwards.

             PUPKIN
Sure.   Sure.

            CATHY LONG
And frankly, we just don't feel you've
got very much to talk about right now.

            PUPKIN
But I've got my whole life to talk
about!

            CATHY LONG
Which is interesting to you, I'm sure
and to your wife ... and to a few
friends. But we feel that you should
keep developing your act. Test it in
some live situations. There are a
number of clubs in the city you can

     try. And after a reasonable period,
     get in touch with us again and we'll
     be glad to send someone down to check
     out your progress.

PUPKIN stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows.

                 PUPKIN
     May I ask you a question, Miss Long?

                  CATHY LONG
     Of course.

                 PUPKIN
     Are you speaking for Jerry?

                 CATHY LONG
     Let's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin.
     Mr. Langford has complete faith in
     our judgment.

                 PUPKIN
     I'm sorry to have to say this, Miss
     Long, and I certainly don't want you
     to take it personally, but I have to
     tell you that I don't ... I don't
     have faith in your judgment.

                 CATHY LONG
     Well, I'm sorry you feel that way,
     Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's
     nothing that can be done about that.

                 PUPKIN
     No ... No ... I'm afraid I'll have
     to disagree with you again.

                 CATHY LONG
           (with strained politeness)
     That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin.
     Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I
     have some things to do. I'm sorry
     the news isn't better.

CATHY LONG turns to go.

                  PUPKIN
     Miss Long?

CATHY LONG turns back.

                 PUPKIN
     When are you expecting Jerry in?

                 CATHY LONG
     He won't be in until very late this
     afternoon.

                 PUPKIN
     That's fine. Thank you.

CATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the
RECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the
reception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST.
The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY
LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN.
PUPKIN continues sitting there.

                 RECEPTIONIST
     Is there anyone else you would
     like to see?

                 PUPKIN
     That's alright. I'm happy just
     waiting.

A few beats pass in silence.

                 RECEPTIONIST
     Well, would you mind waiting outside,
     please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception
     area, not a waiting room.

                 PUPKIN
     I understand.

PUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several
OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at
PUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed
MAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He
goes over to PUPKIN, who stands.

                 OFFICIAL
     Mr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in
     charge of security for the Langford
     organization.

WIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the
following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down
the corridor and into the elevator.

                 WIRTZ
     Now I think you understand that we
     have certain rules here that are
     essential to the smooth functioning
     of our operation.

                    PUPKIN
     Sure.     Sure.

                 WIRTZ
     And that without these rules, we really
     wouldn't be able to function at our
     best. You follow my point?

PUPKIN nods.

                        WIRTZ
            Now one of these rules is that only
            authorized personnel and those having
            official business with our organization
            are permitted on our premises. And
            that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin,
            to cooperate with us.

     They have reached the elevator and WIRTZ has pushed the
     button.

                        PUPKIN
            You want me to leave the building.

                        WIRTZ
            That's right. It's nothing personal,
            Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job.

     The elevator arrives. WIRTZ signals with his head that
     PUPKIN should enter. PUPKIN gets in.

                        WIRTZ
            Have a pleasant day.

55   EXT:   STREET OUTSIDE THE LANGFORD BUILDING - DAY

     PUPKIN comes out and takes up a position outside the door,
     preparing to wait for LANGFORD. MARSHA sees him and comes
     over to him.

                        MARSHA
            Well, did you give it to him?

                         PUPKIN
                   (out of a daze)
            Huh?

                        MARSHA
            Did you get my letter to him?

                        PUPKIN
            He's not in there.

                        MARSHA
            Look, if you don't want to give it
            him, okay. I'll get somebody
            else. But don't try to con me.

                        PUPKIN
            I told you I'd try and I will. I'm
            going to wait for him right here.

                        MARSHA
            Give me the envelope, huh?

                        PUPKIN
            Sure, but ...

                        MARSHA
            I saw him go in myself!

                        PUPKIN
            Who?

                        MARSHA
            Jerry!

                        PUPKIN
            But they said he wasn't in.

                        MARSHA
            Just give me the envelope.

                        PUPKIN
            When did he go in?

                        MARSHA
            Ten minutes ago! That's when.

                        PUPKIN
            You sure?

                        MARSHA
            Look, I saw him my ...

                        PUPKIN
            And he hasn't come out?

                        MARSHA
            I've been standing right here.      Now
            how about it?

     PUPKIN turns and goes back into the building.       MARSHA yells
     after him.

                        MARSHA
            I'm staying right here!

56   INT:   RECEPTION AREA OF THE JERRY LANGFORD OFFICES

     PUPKIN enters briskly and goes up to the RECEPTIONIST.

                        PUPKIN
                  (with authority)
            Tell Jerry Langford I'm here, please.

                        RECEPTIONIST
            I'm sorry, sir. Mr. Langford's not in.

                        PUPKIN
            I happen to know he is.      So would you

            please tell him I'm here.

                         RECEPTIONIST
            I'm sorry.   He's not in.

                        PUPKIN
            You're putting your job on the line,
            lady.

     The RECEPTIONIST starts making a call inside. PUPKIN
     glances at her and walks right in to the inner corridors.
     He starts peering into the open doors of the offices that
     line the corridor. The whole place is like a gigantic
     maze. OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by him, taking no notice of
     him. He continues wandering around desperately, completely
     lost. A few beat later, he spots WIRTZ leading a pair of
     SECURITY GUARDS. PUPKIN keeps peering into offices quickly
     as he flees. The GUARDS and WIRTZ finally catch up to
     PUPKIN at the steno pool and, after a brief chase around
     the pool, they catch PUPKIN and subdue him. They start
     dragging him out past the eyes of the OFFICE PERSONNEL.

                        PUPKIN
                  (calling as he is dragged)
            Jerry! Jerry! (to WIRTZ) You're
            going the have a hell of a lot of
            explaining to do! (calling) Jerry!

                        WIRTZ
            You had your warning, Mr. Krupkin.

                         PUPKIN

            we'll call the police.

                        PUPKIN
            Start looking for a new job!

     MARSHA comes straight up to PUPKIN who is brushing himself
     off. His eyes are glazed and distant.

                         MARSHA
            Well?

                         PUPKIN
            Huh?

            Does he have it?

            Don't worry. I'll get it to him.

                         MARSHA
            Yeah?   When?

     There is a pause.

                        PUPKIN
            This weekend. He asked me to go out

     and says yes. He comes walking out the door, his hounded

61   INT:   CARTIER'S JEWELERS - DAY

     WE WATCH PUPKIN perusing the beautiful diamond, sapphire,
     and emerald rings and we take a few moments to PAN OVER
     these beautiful jewels as he sees them. Finally, he picks
     out a splendid ring with a single, middle-sized sapphire
     and hands a surprised SALESLADY the money in cash.

62   INT:   SUBURBAN TRAIN - DAY

     PUPKIN and RITA are seated side by side. Since it is
     Saturday morning, the train is sparsely populated. A
     CONDUCTOR has just finished taking PUPKIN's tickets. RITA
     is edgy. PUPKIN is strangely calm and a little remote.
     He is wearing his new suit.

                        RITA
            What are we going to do?

                        PUPKIN
                  (patiently)
            Look, I told you, I've got some work
            to discuss with him. That's all.

                        RITA
            But what about me?

                        PUPKIN
            You're with me.

                        RITA
            That's fine, but while you two are
            talking, what am I going to do?

                        PUPKIN
            You can chat with the other guests.

                        RITA
            I'm sure they'll be thrilled hearing
            about the wonderful world of draft beer.
            (pause) Let's tell 'em I'm a model,
            okay?

                          PUPKIN
            What?

                        RITA
            If they ask what I do, let's just say
            I model. You don't mind pretending
            just a little, do you?

                        PUPKIN
            If it make you feel better.

     There is a pause.

                           RITA
            This is    a gas! Too bad nobody'll
            believe    it. (pause) After you guys
            are done    working, what happens? Are
            we going    out someplace, or what?

                        PUPKIN
            I'm sure Jerry has something arranged.

     There is another pause.

                           RITA
            What do    these people do for fun?
            Do they    party or do freaky things
            or just    get drunk or ... I mean,
            What do    they do?

                        PUPKIN
            I guess they just sit around and talk
            and enjoy each other's company, like
            anybody else.

                        RITA
            Talk?!? What can you talk about
            for three or four hours?!

                           PUPKIN
            What do    you mean? They've got plenty
            to talk    about. They do things.    All
            kinds of    interesting things happen
            to them    and then they talk about them.
            What do    you think Jerry's show is all
            about?

                        RITA
            Yeah, a cocktail party with no drinks.
            That's what all those shows are. At
            least they help you get to sleep.

     There is a pause.

                        RITA
                  (glumly)
            Boy, this is going to be some great
            weekend.   I thought we were gonna
            have some fun.

                        PUPKIN
                  (smiling)
            Just take it easy, Rita.     Everything's
            going to be fine.

     WE MOVE IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN who is fading out.

                                      FADE TO:

63   EXT:   A NEO-CLASSICAL MANSION

     It is a large white house with colonial columns set in the
     middle of a palatial estate whose rolling lawns are
     punctuated with fine old trees. We circle around to the
     back where LANGFORD, a handful of his FRIENDS (which can be
     familiar television celebrities) and PUPKIN and RITA are
     just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio. A pair of
     SERVANTS are clearing the table and serving the coffee and
     desert as the scene unfolds. As we arrive, we hear a loud
     burst of laughter. PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY with

stories.

                 PUPKIN
     Oh, you have no idea how bad it's
     gotten in New York. Now the muggers
     are so efficient that, each time
     they jump you, they take your name
     and address and put you on a mailing
     list. (the COMPANY chuckles) And
     once you're on the list, you're in
     real trouble, like this friend of
     mine who was mugged thirty-two times
     on his way home from work. (a little
     laughter from the COMPANY)

A SERVANT places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in
front of PUPKIN and RITA.

                 PUPKIN
           (to SERVANT)
     Thanks.

The SERVANT smiles. As PUPKIN continues his story, he
glances occasionally at RITA who has begun to nibble at her
tart. PUPKIN also glances conspiratorially at LANGFORD
who smiles back.

                 PUPKIN
     So what my friend does is get himself
     a dog, one of those huge German
     Shepherds. One night, he's walking
     the dog in Central Park when he hears
     this voice behind him. (in a German
     accent) Okay, Harry, drop your
     vallet and keep your hantz over your
     head or I bite your little fanny off.

The COMPANY breaks up.

                 ONE GUEST
           (to LANGFORD)
     Looks like you've found yourself a
     winner, Jerry.

                 LANGFORD
           (looking at PUPKIN)
     He's the one who found himself
     a winner.

RITA looks up, smiles and blushes. The rest of the COMPANY
smiles benignly and grows attentive as RITA returns to
eating her tart. Suddenly she bites down on something
hard. She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it. The
COMPANY giggles. It is the ring PUPKIN purchased at
Cartier's. The COMPANY applauds lightly and laughs.
LANGFORD lifts his wine glass.

                 LANGFORD

            To Rita and Rupert -- a short engagement
            and a long, happy marriage.

     The COMPANY drinks with murmurs of "Hear! Hear!"   RITA
     and PUPKIN beam. RITA looks lovingly at PUPKIN.

                        A SECOND GUEST
                  (the PUPKIN)
            Have you set a date?

                        PUPKIN
                  (looking pointedly at LANGFORD)
            Oh, yes.

                        A THIRD GUEST
            I hope we're all invited.

                        PUPKIN
            Everyone's invited.

                                   CUT TO:

64   INT:   THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO

     The theater is packed. World Series bunting hangs from the
     balcony and the front of the stage. We hear RICK ROSS and
     the ORCHESTRA strike up Mendelssohn's Wedding March.   Down
     one aisle walks RITA, accompanied by the MAN whom PUPKIN
     hit over the head at the bar. Down the other aisle marches
     PUPKIN, accompanied by LANGFORD. The AUDIENCE cheers
     wildly. The two COUPLES walk to the stage where a white-
     haired OFFICIAL awaits them. BERT CANTER stands at his
     side. PUPKIN and RITA disengage from their ESCORTS and
     stand before the OFFICIAL. The music stops and the
     AUDIENCE grows quiet.

                        OFFICIAL
            We are met here in these extraordinary
            circumstances to join this man and this
            woman in holy wedlock. But, before we
            begin, let me voice a personal word
            of thanks to you, Rupert and to you,
            Rita, for choosing me to perform this
            prestigious ceremony. Because we are
            on prime time, I am going to discard
            my customary remarks in favor of a
            few personal reflections.   When I was
            principal at Clifton High and these
            two were students, I had very little
            faith that Rupert here would amount
            to very much. But like his teachers
            and his fellow students, I underestimated
            this fine young man.   Some say that
            this misjudgment is directly tied to my
            recent dismissal as head of the Clifton
            School System. But let me take this
            opportunity to set the record straight.
            Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were

            most certainly destined for a great
            career and a lifetime of happiness,
            I voluntarily stepped down. I would
            only here add my own wishes to those
            of millions of viewers for their
            continued health, wealth and
            boundless success.

     The OFFICIAL looks quickly past RITA and PUPKIN.

                        OFFICIAL
            We'll be back to marry them in a minute,
            right after this word.

                                     FADE TO:

65   INT:   THE TRAIN - DAY

     PUPKIN and RITA are seated as they were.      We hear the
     CONDUCTOR calling.

                          CONDUCTOR'S VOICE
            Greenwich.    Greenwich next stop.
            Greenwich.

     PUPKIN and RITA grab their small suitcases and quickly move
     down the aisle towards the door.

                                     CUT TO:

66   INT:   A SUBURBAN TAXI - DAY

     RITA is peering out the window.     PUPKIN is still lost in
     thought.

                        RITA
            Look at that one. How'd you like to
            live in that?!?! Or that one! What
            do you figure these run?

     The taxi stops in front of a walled lot behind which is
     visible a handsome English stucco home.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to DRIVER)
            What's this?

                          DRIVER
            This is it.

                        RITA
            It's gorgeous!

     PUPKIN is genuinely puzzled.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to DRIVER)
            You sure?

                        DRIVER
            Look, friend, I wouldn't want to
            tell you how many times I made this
            trip.   (pause)    That'll be three
            seventy-five.

     PUPKIN, still puzzled, hands him a five dollar bill.

                        PUPKIN
                  (abstractedly)
            Keep it.

     The DRIVER gets out and puts PUPKIN and RITA's bags,
     which he had stacked on the front seat, onto the sidewalk.

                        DRIVER
            Thanks. If you need a ride back,
            just ask the guy for Wayne. That's me.

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK as PUPKIN opens the gate and he and
     RITA walk up the drive.

                                     CUT TO:

67   EXT:   LANGFORD'S HOUSE - DAY

     PUPKIN and RITA stand before the front door. PUPKIN rings,
     After a few beats, the door is opened by an Indonesian
     HOUSEBOY. PUPKIN walks in right past him, RITA following
     behind.

                                     CUT TO:

68   INT:   LANGFORD'S HOUSE - DAY

     PUPKIN hands the HOUSEBOY the two suitcases as he talks.

                        PUPKIN
            You must be Jonno. I'm Rupert Pupkin
            and this is Rita Keane. Mr. Langford's
            expecting us.

     Jonno nods politely but uncertainly.

                        JONNO
                  (uncertain)
            Mr. Langford asked you to come?

                        PUPKIN
            That's right. Would you mind
            taking those up? Jerry and I have
            some work that may oblige me to
            stay overnight.

                        JONNO
            But Mr. Langford's not here.

                        PUPKIN
            Out playing golf, right?

                        JONNO
                  (still puzzled and unsure)
            That's right.

                        PUPKIN
            Maybe he'll finally break a hundred.

                        JONNO
            Maybe it's better if you came back ...

                        PUPKIN
                  (interrupting)
            That's alright. We don't mind waiting.

     PUPKIN walks from the foyer into the living-room, leaving
     JONNO staring after him holding the bags. RITA walks into
     the living room after PUPKIN.

                        RITA
                  (worried)
            The table's only set for one.

                        PUPKIN
            That's from breakfast.     Relax, will
            you?

69   INT:   LANGFORD'S KITCHEN - DAY

     JONNO is on the phone.   A black lady COOK stands at his
     side.

                        JONNO
                  (into the phone)
            Let me talk to Jerry Langford please
            ... I know he is ... It's important.

                                     CUT TO:

70   INT:   LANGFORD'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     It is a handsomely furnished room, done in old American
     antiques and other tasteful pieces. There is a grand piano
     heavy with pictures in one corner and wall-to-wall
     bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance
     of classics and modern popular reading. The whole room
     marks LANGFORD as a man of discernment. The shelves also
     house a fine stereo and a small, discreet bar. RITA and
     PUPKIN walk in like strangers in paradise, awed by the
     obvious elegance and expense the room reflects.

                        PUPKIN
                  (as though he owned it)
            How do you like it?

                 RITA
           (admiringly)
     I could live here.

                 PUPKIN
           (smiling proudly)
     It's the only way to live.

RITA stands in the center of the room, ill at ease, while
PUPKIN strolls about comfortably, picking up an ashtray
here, a cigarette case there, inspecting the artifacts for
inscriptions, clues, hints about LANGFORD's character and
life.

                 RITA
     How come he isn't here?

                 PUPKIN
     You heard the guy.     He's out playing
     golf.

                 RITA
     Didn't you tell him when we'd get here?

PUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's
suspicious inquiries effortlessly.

                 PUPKIN
     We didn't have time to iron out the
     details. Now just relax. We're
     the first guests, that's all.

                 RITA
           (interrupting)
     That Jonno character hadn't even
     heard of us!

                 PUPKIN
           (a little irritated)
     It probably slipped Jerry's mind.
     He has better things to think about
     than what he tells his houseboy.

                 RITA
     It's just not time way I expected it,
     that's all.

There is a pause. PUPKIN continues his investigation.      He
has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room.

                 RITA
     What do we do now?

PUPKIN is looking    at a picture of an American Gothic couple
standing in front    of a wood-frame house. As he comments on
the pictures, the    CAMERA PANS over them. They form a kind
of slide-show of    LANGFORD's life.

                 PUPKIN
     These are Jerry's parents. His father
     runs the Post office in Wolverine --
     that's in North Dakota.

PUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy
standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously
held by the boy) staring at its master.

                 PUPKIN
     This one was in Newsweek. He started
     giving these puppet shows when he was
     still in grade school.

WE SEE a picture of a very young LANGFORD seated before a
microphone with some celebrity.

                 PUPKIN
     And this is from his quiz show in
     St. Louis. Can you believe it?

                   RITA
     Sure I can.

                 PUPKIN
     That was the name of the show.

WE MOVE to a picture of LANGFORD smiling at JACK PAAR.

                 PUPKIN
     And here's when he wrote for Jack
     Paar. He made a hundred and fifty
     a week and look at him now.

Another picture of LANGFORD with a group of women sitting
in a studio.

                 PUPKIN
     And this is his morning show.

A picture of LANGFORD standing in a park with his two boys,
eleven and eight.

                 PUPKIN
     And his kids. He's divorced.

RITA, who has been only half-listening, has picked up a
small, beautifully enameled cigarette box.

                 RITA
     Look at this. I love these kind of
     things. Look at the work.   I've got
     this thing about boxes.

RITA puts it down reluctantly, picks it up, then puts it
down again.

71   INT:   THE KITCHEN - DAY

     JONNO is holding the phone, waiting.     The COOK stands,
     looking at him.

                        JONNO
            Mr. Langford? ... I'm sorry to
            disturb you ...

72   INT:   THE LIVING ROOM - DAY

     RITA has just finished fixing herself a drink. She takes a
     large sip and starts pacing around. PUPKIN is seated.

                        RITA
            How much longer are we gonna have
            to wait?

                        PUPKIN
            I don't know. Until he gets back.

                        RITA.
            Do we have to just sit here?

                        PUPKIN
            He should be back pretty soon.

                        RITA
            Doesn't he have any music or anything?
            Let's get a little life into this place.
            It's like a funeral parlor.

     She walks over to the stereo and opens the cupboard beneath
     it, revealing rows and rows of records.

                        RITA
            This is more like it.

     She pulls out a record.

                        PUPKIN
            Come on, Rita.

                        RITA
            Come on, yourself.

     She puts the record on. Frank Sinatra starts singing "They
     Can't Take That Away From Me." She takes a big sip of her
     drink, puts it down and comes over to PUPKIN.

                        RITA
            How about a little spin, handsome?

                       PUPKIN

                    (pulling back)
            Here?

     RITA snuggles into PUPKIN and starts dancing him around.
     He resists feebly.

                        RITA
            Come on, Rupert.      I came up here for
            a good time.

     PUPKIN gives in and starts      dancing with her in the    style of
     the 1950's, elbow out, arm      up, box step. After a     few
     moments, PUPKIN closes his      eyes. He has reached a     moment
     of perfect bliss, his dream      girl in is arms. They     dance
     silently as we hear Sinatra      singing.

                        SINATRA'S VOICE
            The way you wore your hat,
            The way we danced till three,
            The memory of all that --
            Oh no, they can't take that away from me,
            No ... they can't take that away ...
            from ... me.

     The orchestra plays.

                        RITA
            You never could dance, could you?

                        PUPKIN
            How would you know?

                        RITA
            Oh I danced with you a couple of
            times -- at the Sigma U party.

                        PUPKIN
            You were there with Tommy Winston.

                        RITA
            You didn't ask me.

                        PUPKIN
            That's the one time I did ask you
            and you went with him anyway.

                        RITA
            Well, I couldn't go with you!

                         PUPKIN
            Why not?

                        RITA
            Be serious, Rupert.

                                       CUT TO:

73   INT:   THE DINING ROOM - DAY

     JONNO stands a few feet from the kitchen door, staring at
     RITA and PUPKIN dancing in the living room, an unbelieving,
     anxious expression on his face.

                                    CUT TO:

74   INT:   THE LIVING ROOM - DAY

     The music has stopped momentarily and PUPKIN and RITA
     disengage. PUPKIN looks lovingly at RITA.

                        PUPKIN
            Well, it's all ended happily and
            that's what counts.

     RITA grows jumpy under his gaze.      She looks around.

                        RITA
            I wonder what the rest of this
            place looks like?

                        PUPKIN
            I'm sure it's all very nice.

                        RITA
                  (gaily)
            Well, there's only one way to find out.

     RITA scampers over to the stairs and pauses on the first
     step.

                        RITA
            You coming or not?

     RITA bounds up the stairs.

                       PUPKIN
            Rita!

     CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN up the stairs.

                                    CUT TO:

75   INT:   UPSTAIRS - DAY

     There is no sign of RITA.

                        PUPKIN
            Where are you?

     There is no answer. CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN from room to
     room. They are all guest rooms, neat, pretty, clean.

                        PUPKIN
            Come on, Rita. This isn't funny.

     Finally, PUPKIN opens the door to another room.

                                    CUT TO:

76   INT:   A BEDROOM - DAY

     It is clearly LANGFORD's bedroom with a few clothes strewn
     about, and other signs of being lived in. RITA lies on the
     bed.

                        PUPKIN
                  (shocked)
            What are you doing, Rita?

                        RITA
            I love it! All those millions of
            women out there dying to change
            places with me right now.

                         PUPKIN
            Come on.   We shouldn't be here.

                        RITA
            Relax, will you. Let me have a
            little fun, for Christ's sake.

     RITA gets off the bed and runs into the john.

                                    CUT TO:

77   INT:   A LAVISH BATHROOM - DAY

                        RITA
            Look at this. It's nicer than my
            whole apartment.

     PUPKIN enters the large, beautifully done bathroom.   RITA
     examines her face in the mirror.

                        PUPKIN
                  (urgently)
            Let's go, Rita.

                        RITA
            Boy, I really need some sun.

                        PUPKIN
            Rita, this is Jerry's ...

                        RITA
            Lay off, will you, Rupert.

                        PUPKIN
            But we have no right ...

     RITA picks up a can of shave cream and squirts a large
     dollop in PUPKIN's face. WE COME IN for a CLOSE UP of
     PUPKIN's face, buried under shaving cream.

                        PUPKIN
            That wasn't funny, Rita.

     RITA hands him a towel.

                         RITA
            Here.

     She looks around.

                        RITA
            Now for something that smells nice.

     She swings open the cabinet with a flourish. The door
     swings open violently and the mirror shatters against
     something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink.
     PUPKIN and RITA stand there, staring at each other. RITA
     begins to laugh, but her laugh is cut short by the slam of
     the downstairs door.

                                     CUT TO:

78   INT:   THE FOYER

     LANGFORD has entered, drawn and businesslike.       JONNO and
     the COOK have moved out to greet him.

                        LANGFORD
                  (looking around)
            Where are they?

                        JONNO
            I was going to call the police but
            then I thought to myself 'what if
            they are Mr. Langford's friends?'

     We hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the
     stairs. LANGFORD, JONNO and the COOK look up. PUPKIN
     comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with RITA following
     cautiously behind. PUPKIN has large traces of shaving
     cream behind his ears and on his neck.

                         PUPKIN
            Hi, Jerry.   We were just freshening up.

     PUPKIN stops at the base of the stairs, turns around, and
     waves RITA down.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to RITA)
            Come on, Rita. No need to be shy.

     PUPKIN smiles conspiratorially at LANGFORD.       RITA comes
     slowly down.

                        PUPKIN
            Jerry, I'd like you to meet Rita
            Keane. Rita, say hello to Jerry!

                 RITA
           (tentatively)
     Pleased to meet you.

LANGFORD nods imperceptibly, his face tense, his eyes
alert. RITA, reading her frigid reception, looks to
PUPKIN who walks blithely past LANGFORD into the living
room, toward the bar.

                 PUPKIN
     What's your pleasure?

PUPKIN glances at the small mess he has left on the bar and
turns back to LANGFORD who has moved into the living room
with JONNO and the COOK a few steps behind. PUPKIN flashes
LANGFORD an apologetic smile.

                 PUPKIN
           (to LANGFORD)
     We've already taken the liberty, so
     to speak. Rita was a little nervous.
     It isn't every day she meets someone
     like you.

                 LANGFORD
     What's going on here?

                 PUPKIN
     We've been sitting around, waiting.
     That's all. How was your golf game?

                 JONNO
     I told them you weren't here.

                 COOK
     That's right.

                 PUPKIN
     He did, Jerry. He was very helpful.
     We had to take an early train. There
     was nothing else until after one.
     (pause) I brought the material.
     It's upstairs, in my bags. (pause)
     Where is everybody?

                 LANGFORD
     Who?

                 PUPKIN
     The other guests! (in a confidential
     tone) We're getting a little hungry,
     to tell you the truth.

                 LANGFORD
           (as though confirming
           what PUPKIN said)
     You are.

                 PUPKIN
           (backing off)
     But we don't mind waiting, do we,
     Rita?

RITA says nothing. She has sensed something terribly
wrong and is slowly backing away from PUPKIN.

                 LANGFORD
     You know, I could have you arrested,
     both of you.

                 PUPKIN
           (seizing the idea)
     You know you could! And there'd be
     absolutely no way we could prove we
     belonged here. I never thought of that.

                 LANGFORD
     Well, you should have before you ...

                 PUPKIN
           (still fixed on the idea)
     Maybe we could work up a routine
     about that, about a guy who throws
     all his friends in jail. Let's talk
     about that.

                 LANGFORD
           (sharply)
     Let's not.

                 PUPKIN
     Sure, Jerry. Whatever you ...

                 LANGFORD
           (exasperated)
     Look, if you've got something for
     me to sign, let's have it and get
     it over with so I can get back ...

                 PUPKIN
           (interrupting)
     That wouldn't be right, Jerry.
     Not in your own house!

                 LANGFORD
           (summoning his last
           bit of patience)
     I have a lot of work to get to.
     (to JONNO) How did they get here?

                 PUPKIN
     We took a taxi, Jerry ... But don't
     worry about us. You go ahead and
     do your work and we'll just take a
     stroll around until lunch is ready.

                 LANGFORD
     You're a little thick, aren't you?

                 PUPKIN
           (smiling as though complimented)
     Well, maybe a ...

                 RITA
     What's he's saying, Rupert, is that he
     wants us out.

                 PUPKIN
     Don't listen to her, Jerry. She
     doesn't understand anything about us.

                 RITA
     Don't get me into this.

                 LANGFORD
           (to JONNO)
     Call the station.

JONNO goes back into the foyer, followed by the COOK.

                 LANGFORD
     There'll be a cab here in a few
     minutes. Now if you'll just wait
     at the gate ...

                 PUPKIN
     Look, Jerry, if I've said anything
     out of line, let's chalk it up to
     inexperience, okay? I'll just go
     upstairs and get my tape and we can
     start working. It shouldn't take
     long and then you'll have the rest of
     the afternoon to yourself.

                 LANGFORD
     I've told you just as clearly as I
     can. I want you out of here and I
     want you out now. Scram, beat it,
     vamoose, out! Is that plain enough!

RITA deftly pockets the enamel box.

                 PUPKIN
     But what about my material?    When
     are we going to go over it?

                 RITA
     Come on, Rupert, the man wants us
     to go.

                 PUPKIN
     Tell her she's wrong, Jerry!

                 RITA
     Look, Mr. Langford. I didn't know
     anything about all this. I hardly
     know this guy. I haven't seen him
     in years.

                 PUPKIN
     Rita!

                 RITA
     So if there's anything I can do, any
     way I can make this up to you.

                 PUPKIN
     She's nothing, Jerry. She's just
     some girl who works in a bar.
     Don't let her spoil things.

LANGFORD starts herding RITA and PUPKIN towards the door.

                  LANGFORD
     Come on.   Let's go.

                 PUPKIN
     All I'm asking is fifteen minutes.
     That's all. Just long enough to
     listen to my act. Is that asking
     too much -- fifteen minutes of your
     day against my whole life?

                 LANGFORD
     I'll call the police if I have to.

LANGFORD realizes he is being hard.    He stops for a moment.

                 LANGFORD
     I have my own life, that's all.

                 PUPKIN
     But what about me, Jerry? What about
     my life? I made plans -- based on
     what you said. You can't just turn
     your back on me.

                 LANGFORD
     I'm not telling you again.

There is a long pause as the truth finally sinks in. PUPKIN
just stares at LANGFORD with disbelief that turns to anger.

                 PUPKIN
     So this is the way it   works when
     you're big, huh? You    just play with
     people. Is that part    of the kick,
     Jerry? (pause) I can     see I was all
     wrong about you. All    wrong.

RITA starts tugging at PUPKIN.

                        RITA
            Come on, Rupert.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to RITA)
            Shut up! (to LANGFORD) You weren't
            my friend at all, were you? You were
            just playing some kind of game with me.
            Well, that's not going to stop me,
            Jerry. I'm just going to work a
            little bit harder, that's all, use a
            little bit more enterprise. And not
            count on anybody. That's where I
            made my mistake. I can see that now.

     PUPKIN picks up the pair of small suitcases.

                        PUPKIN
                  (glaring at LANGFORD)
            Come on, Rita. We're wasting our time.

79   EXT.   LANGFORD'S FRONT DOOR - DAY

     PUPKIN strides out with RITA following.     She casts LANGFORD
     an apologetic glance as she goes. The     door slams behind
     them. They walk down the path silently     for a few moments
     as the CAMERA PULLS UP, following them    in an OVERHEAD SHOT.
     We hear them start talking as they make    their way towards
     the gate.

                        RITA
                  (baffled and angry)
            What did you think was going to
            happen? You think he'd just ... ?
            What's the matter with you? (pause)
            You can't just walk into a guy's
            house! And what about me? What
            did you ...

                        PUPKIN
                  (interrupting in a calm
                  but firm voice)
            Shut up, Rita. I'm thinking.

81   INT:   A NEW MERCEDES BENZ - DAY

     MARSHA sits at the wheel of this lavishly appointed sedan,
     her face made up as though she were going to a fancy party.
     PUPKIN sits on the other side of the front seat. His ex-

pression has changed somewhat from the PUPKIN we have seen.
He is less wide-eyed, less innocent, tougher.

                 MARSHA
           (whining)
     How much longer?!?

                 PUPKIN
     Do you want him or not?

There is a pause.

                 MARSHA
     You sure he's in there?

                    PUPKIN
     Certain.

                 MARSHA
           (with obvious delight)
     My parents are going to be furious!

PUPKIN pulls a toy revolver from his jacket pocket and looks
it over. MARSHA glances at it.

                 MARSHA
     It looks real.

                 PUPKIN
     That's the whole point. (gesturing
     with his head towards the entrance
     of the building which is some 50 yards
     away) Pay attention.

MARSHA looks towards the entrance.   A few beats pass.

                 MARSHA
     What if he doesn't come down?

                    PUPKIN
     He will.

                 MARSHA
     But what if he doesn't?

                 PUPKIN
     We'll come back tomorrow.

                 MARSHA
     And wait again?

                 PUPKIN
     Look, you're going to have him all
     to yourself. What else do you want?

A MAN resembling LANGFORD walks out the entrance.

                    PUPKIN

            Is that him?!?

                        MARSHA
            No.

                        PUPKIN
            You sure?

                        MARSHA
            Sure I'm sure. That looks too much
            like him.

                        PUPKIN
            What do you mean?

                        MARSHA
            When it's him it doesn't look like him.

                        PUPKIN
            Keep watching.

     PUPKIN closes his eyes and rests for a moment.

                        MARSHA
            That's him.

     PUPKIN's eyes snap open. WE SEE LANGFORD, concealed in his
     trench coat, dark glasses and tightly pulled cap start walking
     east.

                        MARSHA
            What should I do?

                        PUPKIN
            Wait a second and follow him.

                                      CUT TO:

82   EXT:   A STREET GOING EAST - DAY

     LANGFORD is walking innocently towards his offices.      The
     Mercedes prowls a quarter of a block behind.

86   EXT:     THE SAME EASTBOUND STREET - DAY

     WE STAY with LANGFORD as he walks.  WE SEE the Mercedes
     pull past him. Suddenly PUPKIN is IN THE FRAME, walking
     side by side with LANGFORD.

                        PUPKIN
            Just keep walking or I'll kill
            you right here.

     LANGFORD looks at PUPKIN in terror.        He falters a bit, out
     of fear.

                        PUPKIN
            I said keep walking. This is a gun
            in my pocket and I've got nothing
            to lose.

                        LANGFORD
                  (who keeps walking)
            What do you want?

                        PUPKIN
            Just keep walking and don't talk
            to anybody. I'll tell you what
            to do.

     A MAN    coming the other way stops and stares at LANGFORD
     out of    curiosity. PUPKIN and LANGFORD keep walking. They
     get to    where the Mercedes is waiting. PUPKIN jabs LANGFORD
     in the    ribs with the gun.

                         PUPKIN
            Get in!

                        LANGFORD
            Look, this is ...

                        PUPKIN
                  (interrupting)
            Just shut up and get in.

     LANGFORD gets in the front seat.     PUPKIN follows.

                         MARSHA
            Hi, Jerry.

     LANGFORD looks over and recognizes MARSHA.        A CLOSE UP
     records his reaction of sheer terror.

                                   CUT TO:

88   EXT:   A BROWNSTONE-LINED STREET IN THE EAST EIGHTIES - DAY

     WE SEE LANGFORD get out of the Mercedes which is parked in
     front of a fire hydrant. LANGFORD follows MARSHA into a
     brownstone. PUPKIN walks behind LANGFORD.

89   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY

     PUPKIN, LANGFORD and MARSHA enter. It is an absolutely
     stunning studio apartment, furnished lavishly by Marsha's
     parents for their daughter in antique furniture suitable
     for a woman of fifty. MARSHA has imprinted her own stamp
     on the apartment in two ways: First, the place is abso-
     lutely chaotic. Secondly, there are a number of blow-up
     pictures on the wall. A picture of LANGFORD sits on the
     bureau. There is a big brass bed with an ornate brass
     frame at the foot. LANGFORD stares at MARSHA and PUPKIN.
     PUPKIN closes the blinds and turns on the lights. MARSHA
     trains the gun on LANGFORD. PUPKIN finishes his work and
     takes the gun back.

                        PUPKIN
            I didn't like being so rough out
            there, Jerry. But I wanted you to
            know that I meant business. I didn't
            want anything happening to you over
            some misunderstanding.

     LANGFORD just stares at him, frozen with fear.

                        PUPKIN
            Now I know you're wondering    what
            this is all about. Actually     you've
            got nothing to worry about.     You
            just do what I tell you and    by, say,
            midnight, you'll be safe and    out of
            here. Of course if you try     anything
            clever, I'll kill you -- or    Marsha
            will. She knows how to use     this too.

                        LANGFORD
            You realize what you're saying.

                        PUPKIN
            Come on, Jerry. This isn't a spur

            of the moment thing.    Give me a little
            credit, will you.

     PUPKIN looks over to a small phone table with a chair next
     to it. He motions to it with his head.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to LANGFORD)
            Sit down.

     LANGFORD docilely sits by the phone.

                        PUPKIN
            Now, you're going to call your
            office and tell them this: that
            unless a man who identifies himself as
            the King is allowed on the show
            tonight as the first guest, they'll
            never see you alive again.

                       LANGFORD
            What?

                        PUPKIN

     tainers. There are memos and lists and other papers on

     and the others are looking up at her.

            stop the bullshit ... what? ...
            Okay, I'm listening.

     WE WATCH THOMAS' expression as it turns from skepticism

     LANGFORD is standing awkwardly in the middle of the room,
     wearing a sweater that matches the patch of cloth we saw
     in the envelope MARSHA gave PUPKIN. PUPKIN is still
     training his pistol on LANGFORD and MARSHA is appraising
     the fit.

                                      CUT TO:

98   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - DAY

LANGFORD is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right
up against the high, ornate brass bedstead at the foot of
the bed. MARSHA trains the gun on LANGFORD now. PUPKIN
is unpacking a suitcase. He takes out a handsome blue suit,
ruffled shirt, a bow tie, black shoes, underwear, socks,
shaving equipment, soap, a hairbrush, a clothesbrush, a
small shoe shine kit, aftershave lotion, deodorant and a
dozen or so rolls of inch-and-a-half wide adhesive tape.
He removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big
enough to hold it -- so the mere packing of all this para-
phernalia into such a small space represents something of an
achievement. As he takes the stuff out, he talks to
LANGFORD, his back turned to him.

                 PUPKIN
     This wasn't an easy decision for
     me, Jerry, believe me. For one
     thing, I knew it meant we could never
     be friends again and that hurt me.
     It's hard to lose a friend, even one
     who has let you down. You always
     hope you can patch things up. You
     know, a guy like me doesn't make
     friends that easily.

PUPKIN pauses a moment, then turns to LANGFORD, his voice
filled with emotion.

                 PUPKIN
     Why didn't you just listen to the
     tape when I asked you? Then I
     wouldn't have to be doing all this.
     Was it really too much to expect --
     a few minutes of your time to listen
     to something I'd worked on my whole
     life?

LANGFORD's eyes shift rapidly.   He is obviously calculating
how to deal with PUPKIN.

                 LANGFORD
           (with disarming charm)
     Hey, if that's what's bothering you,
     let's go over to my office and listen
     to that tape right now.

                 PUPKIN
     Are you crazy, Jerry? Do you know
     what would happen to me?

MARSHA listens to this exchange a bit nervously.   Gesturing
to her gun, she says:

                 MARSHA
     Am I going to have to hold this
     thing all day?

PUPKIN sees she has lowered it practically to her side.

                 PUPKIN
           (to MARSHA)
     Just keep it on him. (to LANGFORD)
     You know, Jerry. Friendship is a two-
     way street. All that time I was
     worrying about you and your ratings
     and everything, you couldn't have
     cared less about me.

LANGFORD thinks rapidly for a beat or two.

                 LANGFORD
     You're right. You know that? I
     was thoughtless. It's just that
     when you're doing a big show, it's
     hard to tell who your friends really
     are. I was wrong. I apologize.
     Why don't we just shake hands and
     forget the whole thing?

                 PUPKIN
           (suspiciously)
     That's easy to say, Jerry.

                 LANGFORD
     But I mean it. I'll tell     them that
     the whole thing was a joke    and then
     we can go to my office and    listen to
     that tape. Come on. What      do you say?

LANGFORD rises with his hand extended toward PUPKIN.

                 MARSHA
           (to LANGFORD, sharply)
     Sit down!

LANGFORD looks to PUPKIN.

                 MARSHA
     I said sit!

LANGFORD reluctantly sits down.

                 PUPKIN
           (to MARSHA)
     What's the matter?     You heard
     what he said.

                 MARSHA
     All of a sudden, with a gun on him,
     he wants to make up and be friends.
     And, once he's out the door, what
     happens then?

                 PUPKIN
     What happens then, Jerry?

                        MARSHA
            You get to his office and they
            jump you, that's what happens, Rupert.

                        PUPKIN
            She's right, Jerry.

                        LANGFORD
            Not if I tell them not to. This is
            Jerry, Rupert, I give you my word.

                        PUPKIN
                  (to MARSHA)
            He gives me his word.

                        MARSHA
            Yeah? And what else? Come on,
            Rupert, I'm sick of waiting.

                        PUPKIN
            And what else, Jerry?

                        LANGFORD
            Come on, Rupert. My word's good
            enough, isn't it.

     PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a few beats. Then he shakes
     his head sadly and says in a very quiet, discouraged voice.

                        PUPKIN
            No, Jerry. It's not. (to MARSHA)
            Keep the gun up!

     PUPKIN comes over to LANGFORD with a few rolls of adhesive
     tape in his hand.

                        PUPKIN
            I'm sorry to do it this way, Jerry,
            but I'm no good at knots. Just put
            your arms up and out, okay?

     LANGFORD spreads his arms back against the brass bedstead.
     As PUPKIN goes to tape them, LANGFORD tries to grab him,
     but, with sudden, demonic force, PUPKIN pins him against
     the bedstead. They are practically nose to nose.

                        PUPKIN
            Oh, no, Jerry. None of that.      Now
            hold still.

     We are in the office of WILSON CROCKETT, president of the
     National Broadcasting Network. CROCKETT sits behind his
     desk, facing a group which includes several other NETWORK
     EXECUTIVES, BERT THOMAS, CATHY LONG, F.B.I. INSPECTOR

      PATTEN, and his assistant, GIARDELLO.   They are in the
      midst of debate.

                         PATTEN
             Look, I tell you, the bureau is doing
             everything possible to locate Mr.
             Langford. Right now our men are out
             checking out every radical group in
             this city.

                        AN EXECUTIVE
             Radical?

                         PATTEN
             They're willing to sacrifice their
             leader in order to get their message
             across, aren't they? You've got to
             figure that this is a desperate outfit.
             I don't know who they are anymore than
             you do. But I do know I've got to
             stop them. Otherwise, what you're
             seeing here is just the first of a
             whole wave of these kinds of kidnappings.

                         THOMAS
                   (upset)
             Does this mean we're not supposed to
             put him on?!?

                         PATTEN
             Who am I addressing, please?

                         CROCKETT
             That's Bert Thomas. He produces the
             show.

                         PATTEN
             I'm only saying, Mr. Thomas, that we
             can't allow this to reach the public.
             When the kidnappers call in, of course
             you're going to be cooperative.
             Promise them anything they want.
             After all, this King character is
             going to have to show up sooner or
             later. And once we get our hands
             on him, he'll tell us where Mr. Langford
             is.

      PATTEN grinds his fist into his palm.

101   INT:   THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE

      The scene is as before.

                         PATTEN
             Sure. Let him go on if you have
             to. It's just a taping. You can
             always erase him afterwards, can't
             you? (pause) All I'm saying is this:
             don't put him on the air.

                         THOMAS
             That's fine, Inspector, but let's say
             he finishes his bit and you've worked
             him over ...

                         PATTEN
             Questioned him, Mr. Thomas.

      There is light laughter.

                         THOMAS
             Okay, questioned him and he still
             won't talk. We get to eleven thirty
             and what do we do? Do we air him or
             what?

      There is a heavy pause.

                         PATTEN
             I would say no.

                         THOMAS
             But they might kill Jerry!

                         CROCKETT
                   (breaking in)
             Okay, Burt. (to PATTEN) Thank you,
             Inspector. We appreciate your position
             and we'll do all we can to cooperate
             with you.   But I have to tell you
             right now that, if it comes down to
             it, we're not taking any chances with
             Mr. Langford's life.

                         PATTEN
             I understand but ...

                         CROCKETT
                   (interrupting)
             If your men haven't been able to
             locate Mr. Langford by air time,
             we're going to have to put this King
             guy on, no matter what he's said.
             After all, Inspector, what's ten or
             fifteen minutes of talk show time
             against a man's life?

      WE SEE PUPKIN in his new suit and ruffled shirt, impeccably
      groomed, standing next to the bed. He is talking to
      LANGFORD but we don't see anyone but PUPKIN.

                          PUPKIN
              Open. (pause) Bite ... Good.

      He is wrapping LANGFORD's mouth shut but all we see is that
      he is doing something.

                          PUPKIN
              Can you breathe? Both ways?         In
              and out?

      WE    PULL    BACK TO SEE LANGFORD    nodding. He is strapped to
      the    bed    with tape and encased    like a mummy, only his eyes
      and    nose    showing. PUPKIN has     wrapped him in tape from tip
      to    toe.     MARSHA emerges from    the kitchen stirring something.

                          PUPKIN
                    (to MARSHA)
              You've got until around midnight.
              Have a good time. (to LANGFORD)
              So long, Jerry! Wish me luck.

      Late afternoon. MARSHA is setting the dining room table
      for two. She talks as she works.

             I've got so much to tell you I just
             don't know what to begin with. Are
             you okay?

      LANGFORD mumbles incoherently through his gag and tape.

                         MARSHA
             Good. Tell me if you're not.
             I guess you're wondering why I do
             stuff like this. I think it's
             because I'm a Leo, but my shrink says
             I'm pathologically rebellious and
             self-destructive. You don't think
             I'm self-destructive, do you?

      LANGFORD, mummified, again mumbles and struggles a bit in
      his bonds.

                         MARSHA
             I knew you wouldn't. That's 'cause
             you're the only person in the world
             who really understands me.

     Can Randall* sub for Jerry?

[*Tony Randall is one of any number of substitute hosts.]

                 THOMAS
     His agent's calling us back but it looks
     good. I only told him Jerry's sick.

                 CROCKETT
     Well, if worse comes to worse, Canter
     can always carry it. (to CATHY LONG)
     Let me see your list.

CATHY LONG hands CROCKETT a blue piece of paper.   He
glances over it quickly.

                 CROCKETT
     Any one of these a writer?

                 THOMAS
           (pointing to a name on
           the list)
     McCabe. The Vanishing Siberian Tiger.

     He's out.

     What if we don't run this King guy?
     Who'll fill the time?

                 CROCKETT
     We'll stretch the other guests. But
     I think we're going to wind up running
     him. For one thing, we've got to think
     about Jerry.

                 FIRST EXECUTIVE
     And from a news point of view, we've
     got a responsibility to air this story.

                 CROCKETT
     Exactly, Lou. (pause) I mean, who
     would you rather watch -- some tiger
     expert or a live kidnapper.

                 A SECOND EXECUTIVE
     But nobody's going to know he's a
     kidnapper. They'll think we've gone
     crazy.

                 CROCKETT
     Then they'll read about it in the papers
     tomorrow and, believe me, tomorrow night,
     everyone in America will be watching

             Jerry talk about his experience. And
             he can put this King guy on rerun.

                         THOMAS
             You're going to put him on twice?

                         A THIRD EXECUTIVE
             What if his stuff's unusable?

                         SECOND EXECUTIVE

             the guy. And, as for a wave of these
             things, I just don't buy the idea
             that there are that many people out

             lives in prison for a few minutes
             on television.

                   (to STAGE MANAGER)
             I'm the King.

                   (smiling)
             What can I do for you, your highness?

      CATHY LONG passes by.     She spots PUPKIN, and walks swiftly
      over.

      Two candles burn on the elegantly-set dinner table. MARSHA
      stands in the middle of the room, in front of LANGFORD.
      She is singing. LANGFORD is still encased in tape.

      Now PUPKIN stands before PATTEN, held by PLAINCLOTHESMEN
      who frisk him and hand PATTEN the autograph book.
      GIARDELLO stands next to PATTEN.

                   (to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN)
             I hope you brought me the right guy

             No, Mr. King. That's my assistant,
             Mr. Giardello.

                         PUPKIN
             I want to see someone on the show.

                         PATTEN
             Well, you tell us where Mr. Langford
             is and we'll let you see anyone you
             want.

                         PUPKIN
             Just get me someone from the show.

      PATTEN starts browsing through the autograph book.

                         PATTEN
             Come on, Mr. King. Let's not fool
             around. (looking up from the book)
             Should we know about any of these

                   (gesturing to the book)
             That's Orson Bean.

             I see.   (to GIARDELLO)   Check these
             out.

GIARDELLO starts looking through the autograph book.

                 PATTEN
     Now are you going to talk to us,
     or not?

                 PUPKIN
     Sure I'll talk. Just get me someone
     from the show.

     Get that Thomas guy in here.

GIARDELLO leaves.

                 PATTEN
     We haven't much time, Mr. King.

PUPKIN looks towards the door.

                 PATTEN
     Let's start with your name.

     Rupert Pupkin.

                 PATTEN
     That's your real name?

                    PUPKIN
     Yes sir.

                 PATTEN
     You an American?

                    PUPKIN
     Yes.

                 PATTEN
     Then why do you people do these things?

THOMAS enters.   He scrutinizes PUPKIN.

                 PUPKIN
     Are you on the show?

                  THOMAS
     Yes.   I'm Bert Thomas.

PUPKIN pulls thin piece of neatly typewritten paper from
his inside jacket and hands it to THOMAS.

                 PUPKIN
     Here's the introduction to my act.
     Please make sure Mr. Randall follows
     it exactly as I've written it.

      PATTEN nods to THOMAS who takes the paper and reads it as
      he leaves.

                          PATTEN
             Okay.   How about helping us, Mr. King?

                         PUPKIN
             What about make-up?   I need make-up.

      MARSHA has finished a half bottle of wine. She is eating
      a beautifully decorated piece of stuffed capon and talking
      through her tears.

                   (crying)
             It was the second lead! I'd never

             get the second lead. And what does
             Daddy say?

      SHOT of LANGFORD still bound from tip to toe.

                         MARSHA
             Not "Marsha, that's wonderful" or
             "we're proud of you" or anything.
             Oh no. He starts lecturing me on
             how I should have tried out for
             Emily! Now do you understand, Jerry!

      MARSHA gets hold of herself. She swallows a couple of
      pills and swills them down with some wine.

                         MARSHA
                   (calmer)
             My doctor says I shouldn't get excited.

      MARSHA picks at another piece of capon.

                         MARSHA
             This is the best I ever made it.
             You want some?

      LANGFORD, the mummy, nods. MARSHA picks up the plate
      across from her, fills it with food, and pulls a chair up
      next to LANGFORD. She undoes the tape around his mouth
      and picks a sock out of his mouth.

                          MARSHA
             Now open.   Marsha's going to feed her

briskly, accepting the cheers of the crowd with his arms
raised. He nods and then his eyes fix on those hastily
written outsized cue cards. He reads them with a mixture
of professionalism and wry distance, wanting to disown the
words without seeming silly.

                 RANDALL
     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
     Thank you. Thank you very much. I
     have some sad news for you. Earlier
     today, my writing staff was executed
     in Central Park by the network firing
     squad so there'll be no sensational
     Randall monologue this evening.

The AUDIENCE cheers derisively.

                 RANDALL
     No embarrassing displays of emotion,
     please. (the AUDIENCE laughs) Instead,
     we're going to do something a little
     bit different this evening -- a lot
     different if you ask me. We're going
     to give you a glimpse into the future.
     It isn't often that you can call
     someone a sure thing in the entertainment
     business. After all, the verdict is
     always in your hands. But I think
     tonight, after you've met my first
     guest, you'll agree with me that he's
     destined for greatness -- in one way
     or another. So will you please give
     your warmest greeting to the newest
     King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!!

      Finally after what seems like an eternity, PUPKIN emerges,
      straightening his jacket a bit and trying to crane the
      kinks out of his neck. He is a bit tense but very high
      and in full command. As he delivers his monologue, PUPKIN
      is more confident, comfortable and self-assured than we
      have ever seen him.

                         PUPKIN
             Good evening, ladies and gentleman.
             Let me introduce myself. My name is
             Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton,
             New Jersey, which was not, at that
             time, a federal offense. (laughter)
             Is there anyone here from Clifton?
             (silence) Good. We can all relax.
             Now, I'd like to begin by saying that
             my parents were too poor to afford me
             a childhood but the fact is nobody is
             allowed to be really poor in Clifton.
             Once you fall below eleven thousand
             you're exiled to Passaic. My parents
             did, in fact, put down the first two
             payments on my childhood. Then they
             tried to return me to the hospital
             as defective.   But, like everyone else
             I grew up in large part thanks to my
             mother. If she was only here today
             I'd say, "Hey, mom. What are you
             doing here? You've been dead for
             nine years?" (laughter) You should
             have seen my mother. She was wonderful
             -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent,
             alcoholic. (laughter) We used to
             drink milk together after school.
             Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded.
             (laughter) Once she was picked up for
             speeding. They clocked her doing fifty
             -- in our garage. (laughter) When
             they tested her they found that her
             alcohol was two per cent blood. They
             took away her license and she died
             shortly afterwards. We used to joke
             together Mom and me, until the tears
             would stream down her face and she'd

             throw up. (laughter) And who would
             clean it up? Not Dad. He was too
             busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on
             his own. In fact, until I was sixteen,
             I thought throwing up was a sign of
             maturity. While the other kids were
             off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I
             was hiding behind the house with my
             fingers down my throat. (laughter)
             I never got anywhere until one day,
             my father caught me. Just as he was
             giving me a final kick in the stomach,
             for luck, I managed to heave all
             over his new shoes. "That's it,"
             I thought. "I've made it. I'm
             finally a man!" (laughter) As it
             turned out, that was the only time my
             father ever paid any real attention
             to me. He was usually too busy out
             in the park playing ball with my
             sister, Rose. And, today thanks to
             those many hours of practice, my
             sister Rose has grown into a fine man.
             (laughter) Me, I wasn't especially
             interested in athletics. The only
             exercise I ever got was when the
             other kids picked on me. They used
             to beat me up once a week, usually
             Tuesday. After a while, the school
             worked it into the curriculum. And,
             if you knocked me out, you got extra
             credit. (laughter) Except there was
             this one kid who was afraid of me. I
             kept telling him, "Hit me! Hit me!
             What's the matter with you? Don't you
             want graduate?" As for me, I was
             the only kid in the history of the
             school to graduate in traction. The
             school nurse tucked my diploma into
             my sling. But my only real interest,
             right from the beginning, was show
             business. Even as a young man, I
             began at the very top, collecting
             autographs. (laughter)

      Dinner is over. MARSHA is sitting next to LANGFORD. As
      LANGFORD speaks, it is obvious that he is turning on the
      charm for strategic reasons.

                         LANGFORD
             That was a wonderful dinner, Marsha.

             But it's a little difficult, like this.

      LANGFORD indicates his bonds.

                   (in a tone of intimacy)

             would you do to me? Tell me.

             A lot of you are probably wondering
             why Jerry couldn't make it this
             evening. Well, he's tied up --
             and I'm the one who tied him.
             (laughter) You think I'm joking,
             but that's the only way I could break
             into show business -- by hijacking
             Jerry Langford. (laughter) I'm
             not kidding. Right now, Jerry
             Langford is strapped to a bedstead
             somewhere in the middle of this city.
             (laughter) Go ahead. Laugh. But
             the fact is ... I'm here. Tomorrow
             you'll know I wasn't kidding and
             you'll think I was crazy. But I
             figured it this way: better to be
             King for a Night than Schmuck for
             a Lifetime!!! (laughter) Good
             night ladies and gentlemen. God
             bless you.

      The AUDIENCE applauds heartily. The music plays. And TONY
      RANDALL salutes PUPKIN with a wave of his hand. PUPKIN
      goes off stage after soaking up the applause.

                   (to PLAINCLOTHESMAN)
             Could I have a ride?

      The PLAINCLOTHESMAN says nothing and starts getting in the
      limo.

                         MAE
             I've never been in one.

      The limo pulls away.

                                       CUT TO:

138   INT:   INSPECTOR PATTEN'S DOWNTOWN OFFICE - NIGHT

      PUPKIN stands among a crowd of PLAINCLOTHESMEN who have
      obviously been working him over. PATTEN sits behind his
      desk. GIARDELLO is at his side. The clock on the wall
      reads 10:20.

                         PATTEN
             Okay, Pupkin. We'll start all over
             again. Where is Langford? You know,
             we're going to find him sooner or later.

                         PUPKIN
             I'm trying to tell    you, Inspector.
             You let me walk out    of here, right?
             And as soon as I'm    seen my act on
             the show -- as soon    as I'm sure they've
             really put it on --    I'll tell you where
             Jerry is and you'll    get him back safe
             and sound.

                         PATTEN
             Fine, Pupkin. Then why don't you watch
             the show here with us? That way we're
             all happy. (to GIARDELLO) What channel?

                        GIARDELLO
             Seven.

                         PATTEN
             We get that one in fine.    So what do
             you say, Pupkin?

                         PUPKIN
             Look, I'll say it again.    You let
             me go now.

      PATTEN motions to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN wearily with his
      head. They drag PUPKIN off. PATTEN looks up at the clock.

                                     CUT TO:

139   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      MARSHA is frantically attempting to unwrap LANGFORD. With
      each pull of the tape, LANGFORD yelps. There is a small
      tangle of unwrapped tape collecting around LANGFORD's feet
      and sticking to MARSHA's clothes.

                         LANGFORD
             Watch my hair!

                         MARSHA
             I'm sorry, baby.

      We hear the sound of tape ripping.

                          LANGFORD
             Ow!

                          MARSHA
             I'm sorry.

                                     CUT TO:

140   INT:   PATTEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

      PUPKIN is hustled before PATTEN again.

                         A PLAINCLOTHESMAN
             Still nothing.

      PUPKIN glances at the clock.      It is 11:05.

                         PUPKIN
             I've got to get out of here.

                         PATTEN
             You're not going anywhere, Pupkin.
             Now, where is he?

                         PUPKIN
             I'm telling you, Inspector,    if I don't
             see that show where I    want to see it,
             Jerry Langford is dead. My     people
             have instructions to execute    him
             unless they hear from me by    midnight.

      PATTEN glances apprehensively at GIARDELLO.

                         PATTEN
             Just where is it you want to watch
             this show?

                                     CUT TO:

141   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      LANGFORD is half unwrapped now. The place is covered with
      yard after yard of tape.   MARSHA is working frantically to
      finish unwrapping LANGFORD who is helping now that his arms
      are free.

                          LANGFORD
             Ow!   God damnit! Not so fast!

                         MARSHA
                   (working frantically)
             We haven't all night, baby.

      MARSHA rips the tape off LANGFORD.

                         LANGFORD
             OW!!!!

                         MARSHA
             Oh, I love you, baby.   I love you
             so much.

                                     CUT TO:

142   EXT:   BROADWAY - NIGHT

      A limo drives down Broadway, followed by an unmarked car.

                                     CUT TO:

143   INT:   THE LIMO - NIGHT

      PATTEN and GIARDELLO sit up front, with the DRIVER. PUPKIN
      sits in the back between two PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The limo
      pulls up in front of the bar-restaurant where RITA works.
      PATTEN turns around in the front seat to address PUPKIN.

                         PATTEN
             Here we, are, Pupkin. I don't know
             what this is all about, but as soon
             as you've seen yourself, you're going
             to talk to us or I promise you,
             you'll never see daylight again.

                         PUPKIN
             I'll need a couple of minutes, Inspector.

                         PATTEN

     What?!?

                 PUPKIN
     After it's over, I want a couple of
     minutes. And I'll need ten dollars.
     Does anyone of you gentlemen have my
     wallet?

                 PATTEN
     Don't push me, Pupkin.

                 PUPKIN
     A condemned man's last request,
     Inspector.

                 PATTEN
     Well, I'll tell you right away, the
     answer is no, Pupkin.

                 PUPKIN
     It's not much of a ransom, Inspector ...

                 PATTEN
           (losing his temper)
     Look, I'm drawing the line, that's
     all! No ten dollars and that's it.
     (emphatically) No -- ten -- dollars!!!!
     You understand?!?

                PUPKIN
          (in mollifying tones)
     Sure. Sure, Inspector. No ten dollars ...

                   PATTEN
             (appeased)
     Okay.

                 PUPKIN
     ... and no Jerry Langford.

There is a pause as PATTEN stifles himself.

                 PUPKIN
     Come on, it's getting late, Inspector.

                 PATTEN
           (exploding to     one of his MEN)
     Go ahead. Give him      his goddamned ten
     dollars! Give him      twenty! I don't
     care. Just get him      out of here!

One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN in the back opens the door and
PUPKIN and the other PLAINCLOTHESMAN get out. The unmarked
car has pulled up behind the limo and other PLAINCLOTHESMEN
stand next to it. PUPKIN and the two PLAINCLOTHESMEN start
walking the ten yards or so to the bar-restaurant.

                                CUT TO:

144   INT:   THE BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      PUPKIN marches in flanked by the PLAINCLOTHESMEN. The
      clock over the bar reads 11:30. RITA looks up from talking
      with a CUSTOMER and sees PUPKIN. She says nothing. She
      just looks at him. There are five CUSTOMERS at the bar. A
      working class COUPLE in their late fifties are half-stewed,
      the man telling the woman that her friend, Maud, isn't
      really her friend because she wants $150 for a used
      refrigerator. A few seats down, two MEN in their mid-
      forties, in wind-breakers are locked in an intense but
      inaudible conversation. And, close to the television set
      which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a MOUSY MAN
      with glasses, who looks like an accountant. He is sipping
      a beer, his eyes fixed on the set where the CBS late movie
      is just showing its logo. PUPKIN marches up to the bar.

                         PUPKIN
                   (urgently to RITA)
             Turn on Langford. Seven.

                          MOUSY MAN
             Hey!   I'm watching this.

      RITA keeps staring at PUPKIN.

                         PUPKIN
             Just turn it. Come on.

                         MOUSY MAN
             I was here first, mister. You can't
             just walk in like this. It isn't
             fair.

      RITA glances at the MAN. PUPKIN can't      wait. He vaults
      onto the bar and turns the set to the     Langford Show, just
      as, on screen, he walks from the wings     onto the stage to
      the applause of the studio audience.      Perched atop the bar,
      standing next to the image of himself,     PUPKIN looks down at
      RITA, a smile of pride and triumph on     his face.

                                      CUT TO:

145   MONTAGE -- NIGHT

      PUPKIN walking onto television screens in various homes
      across America -- in a chic New York living room, in a
      suburban bedroom, in the parlor of an Indiana farmhouse,
      in a kitchen where a COUPLE is in the middle of a raging
      domestic quarrel, in an otherwise dark bedroom where a
      COUPLE is in the throes of lovemaking, in a bar, a station
      house, in a television store window display.

                                      CUT TO:

146   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

      MARSHA has just removed her dress and stands in      her bra and
      panties as LANGFORD unwraps the last tape from      about his
      ankles. The room is swimming in tape, like an       enormous
      boa constrictor gone mad. MARSHA moves towards       LANGFORD,
      her arms open.

                          MARSHA
             Oh, baby.   Baby.

      LANGFORD frees his ankles of tape just in time to side-step
      MARSHA and moves quickly to the dining room table where he
      grabs the gun. He trains it on her.

                         LANGFORD
             Stop!

      MARSHA moves toward him. He pulls the trigger, releasing
      a plastic pellet that hits MARSHA in the stomach, stinging her.

                         MARSHA
             Ow!

      LANGFORD glances down in horror at the gun which he now
      realizes is a toy and looks up in horror to see MARSHA,
      bigger than life, bearing down on him.

                         MARSHA
             Don't be afraid of Marsha, baby.

                                      CUT TO:

147   INT:   BAR-RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      The CUSTOMERS are watching the conclusion of Pupkin's
      monologue, along with the PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN. WE
      COME IN a split second after a joke. The CUSTOMERS laugh,
      with the exception of the MOUSY MAN who is waiting, in bad
      humor, for Pupkin's act to finish. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN
      laugh reluctantly. PUPKIN, no longer standing on the bar,
      but back down with the others, watches with fascination.
      RITA watches grimly, occasionally glancing at PUPKIN.

                         PUPKIN on TV
             But I figured it this way: better to
             be King for a Night than Schmuck for
             a Lifetime. (audience and CUSTOMERS
             laugh)   Good night, ladies and
             gentlemen, and God bless you.

      The television audience applauds and the CUSTOMERS applaud
      and cheer in good humor except for the MOUSY MAN. The
      HALF-STEWED MAN leans across his WOMAN to yell at PUPKIN
      as the two FRIENDS in windbreakers congratulate PUPKIN at
      the same time. There is a brief moment of carnival
      excitement.

            HALF-STEWED MAN                FIRST FRIEND
      Hey, that's pretty good.             (to PUPKIN)

Schmuck for a Lifetime!      How do you think up all
(to the WOMAN) You know      that stuff?
who he's talkin' about?
Your brother!
                              SECOND FRIEND
      HALF-STEWED WOMAN       It's a trick, that's
What about your        all. Larry can do it
brother?                as good as him.

      HALF-STEWED MAN        MOUSY MAN
What about him?              Is it over now?

      HALF-STEWED WOMAN             FIRST FRIEND
He's another one.       He's funnier than Larry.
                        Larry just makes a lot
      HALF-STEWED MAN of faces.
(getting a little angry)
I told you to shut up about         MOUSY MAN
my brother. (to PUPKIN)       Well, if nobody
She doesn't know nuthin'.     minds ...

PUPKIN takes all this praise and excitement with a shy
smile of satisfaction, glancing at RITA from time to time
for her reaction. She merely stares at PUPKIN with a sad
expression on her face.

                 PUPKIN
     Come on, Rita. Don't spoil the party.
     (to the CUSTOMERS) Drinks all around
     on me.

                 HALF-STEWED MAN
           (in a loud voice, to HALF-
           STEWED WOMAN)
     What about the hundred and fifty?
     We never saw a penny outta your
     brother.

                 HALF-STEWED WOMAN
     That's because my brother is a family
     man, not like Phil.

The argument between the HALF-STEWED MAN and his WOMAN
continues at the end of the bar. The two FRIENDS have
resumed their intense conversation.

                 PUPKIN
           (to the two FRIENDS)
     What'll you have?

                  FIRST FRIEND
     I'm okay.   Thanks, pal.

                 SECOND FRIEND
     Me, too.

The MOUSY MAN has climbed up on the bar and has turned the
TV back to the late movie. He sits enthralled by a scene

of violence courtesy of Tony Curtis as the Boston
Strangler. PUPKIN looks down the bar at the STEWED COUPLE
to offer them drinks, but they are lost in an argument
over the relative merits of their brothers. PUPKIN turns
to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN.

                 PUPKIN
     I don't suppose you're allowed anything.
     (to RITA) I guess nobody's in a
     celebrating mood. How about you?
     You want something?

                 FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN
     It's getting time, Pupkin.

                 PUPKIN
     In a second.

                 RITA
           (in a sad, serious voice
           to PUPKIN)
     That was true, wasn't it? ... about
     the kidnapping.

PUPKIN nods and shrugs.

                 PUPKIN
     Now you can say you knew me.   That's
     something, anyway.

                 FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN
     Come on, Pupkin.

                 PUPKIN
           (to RITA, in a quiet,
           tender voice)
     I guess I've got go. Take care of
     yourself, will you. And when you're
     bored -- you know, when you're brushing
     your teeth or something, give me a
     thought, okay?

                 RITA
     Okay.

The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN out of the bar. The two
FRIENDS are still buried in their intense, private
conversation. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN walk past
the HALF-STEWED COUPLE.

                 HALF-STEWED WOMAN
     It's okay to talk about my sister,
     but we can't say nuthin' about Phil,
     is that it?

                 HALF-STEWED MAN
           (to PUPKIN)
     She's just had one too many.

      The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN onto the street.

148   EXT:   THE BAR - NIGHT

      As they walk the few steps to the car, the FIRST
      PLAINCLOTHESMAN turns to PUPKIN.

                         FIRST    PLAINCLOTHESMAN
             I just don't get    it, Pupkin. You're
             gonna spend eight    years in the can --
             "minimum" -- and    for what?

                         SECOND PLAINCLOTHESMAN
             Yeah, Pupkin. You threw it all away.

                         PUPKIN
                   (vaguely)
             We'll see.

      WE CLOSE IN on PUPKIN, smiling.

                                       FADE TO:

149   INT:   THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW STUDIO - NIGHT

      The STAGE MANAGER is counting down. At zero, he points to
      RICK ROSS who launches the orchestra into the Langford Show
      theme song. BERT CANTER, standing stage right, speaks into
      the mike.

                         CANTER
             And now! Direct from New York!
             The Jerry Langford Show, starring
             Jerry's special guest, out on bail,
             Rupert Pupkin, the kidnapping King
             of Comedy!!!!

      The AUDIENCE applauds mightily and the FINAL CREDITS roll.
      As they roll, the music to the Langford Show continues and
      WE WATCH a MONTAGE that shows PUPKIN progressively taping
      LANGFORD to the back of a brass bedstead on stage as the
      two of them talk and laugh. By the end of the MONTAGE,
      LANGFORD is once again mummified and PUPKIN, having
      finished, bows and smiles. WE CLOSE on a FREEZE-FRAME
      CLOSE UP of PUPKIN in ecstasy.

                                       FADE OUT.
